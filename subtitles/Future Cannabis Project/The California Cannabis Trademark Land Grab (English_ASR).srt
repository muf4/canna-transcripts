[Music]

2
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:32,849
give it out and know that they're not

3
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:35,549
gonna lose control and get and

4
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,840
never either ones like someone's just

5
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:41,250
gonna steal it there's really two areas

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,980
of intellectual property that that would

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,378
relate to and your strongest level of

8
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:51,479
enforcement would be a patent also

9
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:54,229
really hard to get but if it could be

10
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:58,078
granted it would have in a range of

11
00:00:54,229 --> 00:01:00,628
profile for cannabinoids growing style

12
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,539
for the plant it's going to be very

13
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:06,149
specific to that kind of plant now we

14
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,969
haven't seen any of that enforced yet in

15
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,820
the industry but in theory if someone

16
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:15,000
stole your genetics that was an exact

17
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:17,399
one for one if you could have a patent

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,170
registered on this prior to putting it

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,430
in commerce or prior to the theft you

20
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,200
that would be the strongest enforcement

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,900
most people are not going to do that

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,210
most people can't afford that the

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,868
question of being able to show the

24
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:40,019
evidence that you actually cultivated in

25
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:41,578
a specific way that would qualify for

26
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:43,728
the patent registration most people

27
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,769
can't really provide that evidence the

28
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:50,429
more accessible way would be through a

29
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:52,259
trademark and what you would do is you

30
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,939
would concede that the genetics are

31
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,049
going to get out but what you would

32
00:01:53,938 --> 00:02:01,109
focus on is this is so we'll say the

33
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,570
strain is Stardust right that's what you

34
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:07,219
decided to call it you would focus on I

35
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:10,560
am great seeds which is the brand

36
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:12,039
trademark Stardust so if other people

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,989
are buying Stardust

38
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:19,870
from other Creators or other cultivars

39
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:21,938
cultivators they just they trust your

40
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,090
brand and I think that is one of the

41
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:28,000
best ways we can do it right now because

42
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,469
if you see other packaging so long as

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,389
you record your trademark with the state

44
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:32,859
of California which as of January 2nd at

45
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:34,389
9:00 a.m. they started accepting

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,400
cannabis trademarks for cannabis goods

47
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:39,039
and services so long as you're not

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,670
trying to trademark the name of the

49
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,289
strain which is not allowed at the

50
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:49,408
federal level if a plant has ever been

51
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:53,858
identified by its cultivar rule 12 zero

52
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:56,009
2.12 I believe of the TM EP states that

53
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:58,239
any plan identified by its cultivar that

54
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,709
cultivar is not able to be registered as

55
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,019
a trademark if you want to do more

56
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,819
research on this check out what happened

57
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,549
with the Honey Crisp Apple situation

58
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:08,708
that they filed the patent in the patent

59
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:11,260
identified Honey Crisp as the cultivar

60
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,269
then University I think it's a Minnesota

61
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,969
went to seek trademark protection at the

62
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:19,120
federal level for honey Kris to which

63
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:21,519
for the application the inquiry was well

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,009
is this the name the cult of our name of

65
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,669
the plant and on the patent it was

66
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:29,858
registered as the cultivar name so that

67
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:34,060
they ended up getting denied they filed

68
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:35,530
a trademark on Honey Crisp so this law

69
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,000
is already in effect for plants and

70
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,848
actually for doing more research they

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,680
use the same law in Canada so there is a

72
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:43,479
novel issue with trying to protect

73
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,400
strain names as trademarks right now

74
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,988
that I think the industry is going to

75
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,250
have to deal with a lot in the upcoming

76
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,250
years probably in the next two years

77
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:56,259
we're gonna see a lot more of this but

78
00:03:51,250 --> 00:04:00,568
if you are the farm the seed company any

79
00:03:56,259 --> 00:04:01,719
of these brands and you sell it as farm

80
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:06,280
trademark

81
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:07,568
TM this strain for Stardust that is a

82
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,250
way to protect it and you can have

83
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:11,888
strength in this because if you see

84
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,180
anyone else claiming sure the genetics

85
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,359
might get grown you we're going to

86
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,030
assume it's inferior quality if it's

87
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,589
better than yours that only in certain

88
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,408
ways helps to your legacy if you say I

89
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,549
originally came up with a strain but if

90
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,000
anyone else is claiming that it's

91
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,400
directly

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,379
your source you're gonna be able to

93
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:39,239
fight that which is a new opportunity in

94
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:39,240
California second night yes of this year

95
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:50,680
I think the issue now is I want to guard

96
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,780
that right like the Colonel's secret

97
00:04:50,680 --> 00:05:05,769
recipe right which is a trade secret

98
00:04:52,779 --> 00:05:09,369
right would willingly for example give

99
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:12,159
my clippings to a nursery to them from a

100
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:16,139
key to that sell to growers would then

101
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:20,410
flour it out we then get Stardust right

102
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,990
I kind of a cheeky answer it depends on

103
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:26,460
the range of penetration you want your

104
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:29,139
genetics to have in the market maybe

105
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:32,109
you're like you find a sweetheart deal

106
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,759
and you just do a license of I'm gonna

107
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,379
write a contract with this cultivator

108
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,930
and give them just one plant that

109
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:39,370
they're and this is the one company that

110
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,990
I'm gonna do it with because I really

111
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,300
believe in their ability to propagate

112
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,728
this maybe you would do that especially

113
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,120
if you have some mystique or some

114
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:52,509
renowned for being a geneticist there I

115
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,060
think that could be viable but if you

116
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:57,430
want to hold it really tight trying to

117
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,350
establish that chain of control is very

118
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,389
difficult right now because really if

119
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,460
one clipping gets out unless you've

120
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,978
taken steps like filing a patent or

121
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:07,449
registering a trademark and the genetic

122
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:09,728
did loose trying to assert ownership

123
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:11,978
over that is unrealistic it's just not

124
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:13,990
gonna happen right now so I think you

125
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:16,539
either have a really structured I mean

126
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,129
if you wanted to try and I don't even

127
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,939
think protecting it as a trade secret

128
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,740
would work

129
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:22,420
well because as soon as you share it

130
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,240
with someone it's not really a secret so

131
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,500
yeah I think protecting the name of it

132
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,110
as a trademark or trying to get

133
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,930
registration as the patent is best but I

134
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,080
do think there is incentive for people

135
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,300
developing genetics to share this you

136
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,919
just have to create the brand around the

137
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,110
genetics that's the thing that'll be

138
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,600
easiest for you to protect and then it's

139
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,000
just an incentive of I provide quality

140
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,050
clones or quality seeds which I think

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,279
there's going to be an increased demand

142
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:54,300
for that I think there's a really solid

143
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,529
role for nurseries especially supplying

144
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,389
consistent clones to these large-scale

145
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:00,489
cultivating operations that maybe don't

146
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,349
want to deal with having a constant

147
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,269
clones of pie or dedicating part of

148
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,850
their grow operation to creating mother

149
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:07,899
plants and doing that upkeep so I think

150
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:26,530
you could make a name for yourself

151
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:28,829
definitely as a nursery right to

152
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:32,609
propagate

153
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:34,620
genetics right sell them to other people

154
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,610
that flower it's gonna be a lot of

155
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,319
restrictive clauses so focused on how

156
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,699
much plot space do I get how many plants

157
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,620
are you gonna have in production for me

158
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,780
how many clones are do you have to be

159
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,689
accountable for tracking how many clones

160
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:51,000
you take do I get to try and dictate who

161
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:53,069
you sell the clones to things like that

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,649
so I can try and control the chain of

163
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:57,840
command the question for a lot of these

164
00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:00,060
would be would they be enforceable terms

165
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,818
I feel like we haven't really tested

166
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,319
that as much in in California this is

167
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,060
going to happen though I think this is

168
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,348
an issue that probably if there's a lot

169
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,978
of agreements being developed around

170
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:12,839
these terms right now so a lot of

171
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:15,318
restrictions of just do I have the

172
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:19,049
ability to inspect your site do I have

173
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,968
because a lot of these are like getting

174
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,530
creative with the amount of control

175
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:24,620
without saying I actually have an

176
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:27,239
ownership interest into your business or

177
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,228
and because you're still potentially

178
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,728
running the risk of having them to

179
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:32,069
someone be like tear up your contract

180
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:35,009
I'm gonna go do whatever I want so I

181
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,200
think for someone developing genetics

182
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:39,000
finding the solid relationship first

183
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,509
where hopefully you're never gonna need

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,309
to enforce the contract is key or your

185
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:46,588
inverse that is I just believe in my

186
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:48,179
genetics I want them out there I have my

187
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,709
trademark attached to this and they get

188
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:52,319
to use my trademark saying I'm buying

189
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:54,359
clones from nursery acts or seed

190
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,010
producer acts and I just want everyone

191
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,509
happened like if every of all of

192
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,980
California was growing my genetics I

193
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:03,740
would love that because my market

194
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:06,149
penetration is amazing so yeah I think

195
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,450
trying to control these things where if

196
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,950
you find out your employee so I give you

197
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,600
this plan and I find out your employee

198
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,209
brought it home and shared it with their

199
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,370
friends trying to have some form of

200
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:20,009
legal recourse and then then like

201
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,839
enforcing that is really difficult and

202
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:25,470
cost prohibitive for a lot of businesses

203
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,850
so theoretically that could work but

204
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,629
then trying to assess what are the

205
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:32,730
damages you know where is the the value

206
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:33,439
that was detracted from my part of the

207
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,230
contract

208
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,680
that seems kind of onerous and undefined

209
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,330
right now once again I mean it's going

210
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,029
to depend contract and relationship by

211
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:46,160
relationship contract by contract but I

212
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:47,389
think the enforceability for a lot of

213
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,759
these things would be more cost

214
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:51,139
prohibitive it's a lot easier if its

215
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,819
premise around something like you're

216
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,919
infringing on my trademark you're using

217
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,030
my trademark in a way I don't want or in

218
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:59,479
the case of if there was a patent

219
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,799
registered in that sense but just hey I

220
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,389
wrote a contract with you I trust you

221
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:06,949
with my genetics don't dick me over that

222
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:15,649
is a harder one to afford so especially

223
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:19,820
for assessing damages majority of my

224
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:21,709
practices and trademarks and because

225
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,950
California just started this opportunity

226
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,940
to register trademarks for cannabis and

227
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,379
goods and services

228
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,770
there's a little bit of a land grab

229
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:33,620
going on right now and if you register

230
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:35,329
first trying to invalidate that

231
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,820
registration if someone else is the

232
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,350
superior right to the trademark is

233
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,970
fairly problematic

234
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,320
it's a litigation there is not a I'm

235
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,940
gonna call up and complain to the state

236
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,300
and invalidate your trademark that

237
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,590
really doesn't happen so trying to

238
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:53,389
establish what you own right now is huge

239
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,399
talking about agreements and other

240
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:58,009
issues that are coming up the due

241
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,980
diligence side the wild claims of who

242
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:02,899
owns what right now are pretty amazing

243
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,909
in some cases and doing the actual due

244
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:08,169
diligence of saying if I'm gonna

245
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:10,399
contract with you make sure that I see

246
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:12,199
documentation substantiating that you

247
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,879
actually own this intellectual property

248
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,800
not a hey I own this because there has

249
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,120
been certain famous strains that have

250
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,159
made the news where there was an

251
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,159
assertion of I own this because I'm

252
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:28,789
telling everyone I do that doesn't make

253
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:30,709
it legally bind it and there is some of

254
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:33,799
that going on right now so I encourage

255
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:36,259
diligence especially have an

256
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:37,750
understanding of whatever you're trying

257
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:40,539
to license and make

258
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,220
that you've taken steps to protect it or

259
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:43,929
if you're taking your licensing

260
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,970
something from someone make sure it

261
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:50,859
actually has value there is a very low

262
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,300
understanding I feel like of different

263
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,730
intellectual property issues in the

264
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:56,289
cannabis space right now and I don't

265
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,330
expect everyone to just know these

266
00:11:56,289 --> 00:12:02,469
things you know but work with someone

267
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:04,810
who does because I've seen a Lulu

268
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,090
I've seen some agreements that I don't

269
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:08,319
know if they will they would hold up in

270
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,990
court

271
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,129
I've seen some requests that I don't

272
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:16,840
think are reasonable and then from the

273
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:18,460
other side of outside of agreements I've

274
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,080
seen some filings and their core dings

275
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,120
that have been done that are just

276
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,750
completely invalid or should never have

277
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,970
been done and so I think there is an

278
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,139
immense amount of value going forward

279
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,110
for protecting your intellectual

280
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:34,419
property but having an understanding

281
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,820
what that actually is and if it one is

282
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:38,829
it protectable - have I taken the steps

283
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,240
to protect it or three if I'm engaging

284
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,889
someone else do they own it like those

285
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,669
are really fundamental questions you

286
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:44,669
need to be asking

287
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,490
as you said like intellectual property

288
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:55,129
so like an example that'd be like I

289
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,680
created Peters brand in Colorado and

290
00:12:55,129 --> 00:13:00,200
you're gonna license Peters brand

291
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:02,269
California right your point that you the

292
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,009
California guy should make sure I can

293
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:05,899
show you trademarks

294
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:07,610
yes and in that case you're probably

295
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,889
going to write into part of the

296
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,440
licensing agreement when you license

297
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,929
into California I'm not gonna seek

298
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,240
trademark protection trying to use syrup

299
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:18,769
your registration and after I start

300
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,709
using your trademark you're going to

301
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:23,570
register the registration there's a lot

302
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,609
of room for that to go bad also if

303
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,430
you're coming in from out of state if

304
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,620
you the licensee hasn't taken steps to

305
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:32,208
protect if you're just basing this

306
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,959
purely off estate right and there's no

307
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:38,838
federal registrations and that isn't

308
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:40,099
registered to have the license or turn

309
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,079
around and then register some of the

310
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:46,940
intellectual property that's totally a

311
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,739
possible outcome so taking the steps to

312
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,620
say hey if we're gonna do this you're

313
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,329
gonna forgo XY and Z and allow me to do

314
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,250
it and then we understand that really

315
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:57,349
that's going to be the sub substance of

316
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,120
this Agreement but I might not have had

317
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:05,329
the opportunity to even register the

318
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:08,360
trademark yet Colorado bed because most

319
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:10,789
so between federal and state trademark

320
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,800
applications at the federal level you

321
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:15,948
are allowed to do what's called 1b

322
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:17,719
filing or an intent to use filing a 1a

323
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:20,870
filing is that I'm actually using the

324
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,160
trademark in commerce and mind you you

325
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,198
can't get a federal trademark on

326
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,458
cannabis or cannabis goods and services

327
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,500
because it's a violation of the

328
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:29,778
controlled substance act do the schedule

329
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,769
1 status so that's not waffle used in

330
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:33,230
commerce the best you can do is

331
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:35,179
ancillary goods and services but at the

332
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,539
state level depending on the state

333
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:37,338
you're in

334
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:40,039
you can register on goods and services

335
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:42,110
for cannabis but the requirement there

336
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:43,759
is there is no one be filing there's

337
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,639
only I'm actually using it so if you're

338
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,769
coming from Colorado licensing the brand

339
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,600
into California you probably haven't

340
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:52,610
used the trademark in commerce yet and

341
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,159
you're the licensee will be the first

342
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,750
one to use it so if they use it and then

343
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,000
registered it right away

344
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,610
you've created a very and you haven't

345
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,558
included a term

346
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,850
saying you are not going to do the

347
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:06,610
registration I'm gonna do the

348
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,470
registration and own it you're creating

349
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,688
a very interesting issue at the contract

350
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,509
because who really owns the trademark

351
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:17,798
then and did that trademark get entered

352
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:20,739
into the agreement or so yeah that there

353
00:15:17,798 --> 00:15:24,188
are a lot of problems there is we can't

354
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:26,199
generally do an A to B solution for

355
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:28,298
cannabis right now there's usually a few

356
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:30,278
extra steps and especially at the state

357
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:33,009
level when it's state to state because

358
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:34,869
your protection doesn't expand past the

359
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:36,489
state that you've registered them so

360
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:38,040
taking those steps to say okay well if

361
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:40,739
we're gonna license into another state

362
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:43,389
how do we go about protecting ourselves

363
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:45,278
either before the agreement is signed or

364
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:47,489
in conjunction with signing the

365
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,489
agreement

366
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,860
[Music]

367
00:15:54,919 --> 00:16:01,849
I mean you're gonna see some internal

368
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:04,069
maybe even a term of hey if you're

369
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,540
producing this for me I'm gonna license

370
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,370
you my trademark even if it's just

371
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:08,870
internally in the same state

372
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,600
I don't maybe I'm not going after

373
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,948
manufacturing license so but I own the

374
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,259
intellectual property so I'm gonna

375
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:17,599
license you my trademark or my branding

376
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:18,708
and then have you create the products we

377
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,389
probably have some sort of free

378
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,638
agreement for you to create and do the

379
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:24,620
manufacturing and then I would maybe

380
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,100
collect a royal royal tea payment for

381
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:30,078
the use of the trademark maybe with art

382
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,560
so if somebody designs some really cool

383
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:35,208
art for your packaging or your website

384
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,768
or something and they would license you

385
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:39,109
write a licensing agreement if you have

386
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:41,120
limited access to my art or my artistic

387
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,860
works and then that's hopefully

388
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,959
protected by a copyright registration

389
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,230
that that would get bundled into the

390
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,819
licensing agreement for patents you know

391
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,190
maybe I have a method that I have

392
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,980
registered a patent on method of

393
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,540
extraction and I will license you the

394
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,089
use of that technique or if there's a

395
00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:01,189
machine that I don't want to manufacture

396
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,140
because it's gonna be too expensive but

397
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,120
you have a great manufacturing facility

398
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:08,769
how license you might design that I've

399
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:13,399
registered as a patent trade secrets

400
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:14,990
maybe I have an edible company that I'm

401
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,230
we're just known for having amazingly

402
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,578
good cookies and my recipe I've not

403
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,699
shared with anyone and that's my

404
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:24,500
proprietary blend and I'm gonna license

405
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,240
you that so long as you don't share the

406
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,859
secret with anyone your employees

407
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,539
generally don't know there's probably

408
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:32,449
some other restriction and agreement

409
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:35,329
where that extra little secret when I

410
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,710
put nutmeg in it like one or two people

411
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:39,529
at your company know that and they do it

412
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,819
in the backroom but all those things

413
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:42,319
could be internally those don't have to

414
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:44,869
be state to state we're gonna see a lot

415
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,129
more dynamic licensing agreements

416
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:49,909
between businesses that don't

417
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:51,850
necessarily do everything or somebody's

418
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,440
stand out and

419
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:55,250
they don't have the ability to maximise

420
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,990
on production

421
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,720
so let's license it to someone else and

422
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:03,019
let's collect royalty payments just as

423
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,569
much also so state state to state we're

424
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:06,889
gonna start seeing international

425
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:08,450
definitely branding are is moving

426
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,580
international the concept of

427
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,200
international canvass brand is very real

428
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:15,500
it's not a theoretical like that's going

429
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,549
on and that it gets only more dynamic

430
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,140
because then you have two different

431
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:20,450
jurisdictions of law trying to figure

432
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,009
out how do you do an enforcement what's

433
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:28,900
the obligation what's my ability to

434
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:32,029
police or monitor my contract trademarks

435
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,470
especially Canada and actually I just

436
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:36,859
learned that they're gonna have an issue

437
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:39,440
with social media but it sounds like

438
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:41,740
there will be a way to do agreements

439
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,140
where trademarks get brought up from

440
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:47,000
California get used in Canada Canada has

441
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,670
restrictive packaging so it's a very

442
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,009
dumb down packaging but if you have a

443
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:56,660
brand that already has a very flourished

444
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:58,879
social media presence exactly

445
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,220
so being imposed to building a

446
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,920
grassroots up brand where you have very

447
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,839
limited marketing and your packaging is

448
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,740
nondescript and you have this much space

449
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:11,178
for a logo in in Canada their massive

450
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,569
packaging just was learning about this

451
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:16,790
massive packaging restrictions so if you

452
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:17,899
have an American brand or it doesn't

453
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:20,269
have to be American you have a brand

454
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,210
that already has a robust following and

455
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:24,889
brand identity putting that on because

456
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,500
people the natural people use their

457
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,740
phones Oh what is this and if there's

458
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,539
already this developed market I think

459
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,539
for consumers that's fairly persuasive

460
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:38,928
opposed to what's this other brand that

461
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:41,569
has maybe 3,000 social media followers

462
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:44,350
or like is that any good might be good

463
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:47,659
but it doesn't have as much of a

464
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:50,269
following and a lot of consumption or

465
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,970
consumers buy based off of the reviews

466
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:53,450
of other people or have I heard of this

467
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,360
before

468
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,819
so yeah bringing California brands that

469
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:03,769
are established up to to Canada

470
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:05,778
is in discussions that is definitely in

471
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,849
discussions from a different

472
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:09,440
international and I have not worked on

473
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:12,168
this I spoke with an Israeli attorney

474
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,570
about it but trying to do patent

475
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:17,240
licensing issues from Israel to the

476
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:19,339
United States and even doing completion

477
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,558
of research and development in Israel

478
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:23,869
for aspects of patents that we couldn't

479
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:25,940
do the research on in the United States

480
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:28,189
without being at federally illegal so

481
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,048
just doing research for that amount in a

482
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,730
different country and then bringing that

483
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:34,190
part of the patent back or that part of

484
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,569
the intellectual property back and from

485
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,100
the international side my advice would

486
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:40,548
just be hire an international attorney

487
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:41,599
like if you for these deals you

488
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:43,038
shouldn't be working with someone

489
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,480
domestically who has your own best

490
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,579
interest and they should have a

491
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,230
counterpart in the other country who

492
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,058
also then can say well here's the laws

493
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,500
here's how this is same here's this is

494
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:52,940
how this is different

495
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,250
opposed to just relying on the other

496
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,929
side your licensing to having their

497
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,599
representation and telling you oh yeah

498
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:01,070
this is our part of the contract is good

499
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,428
that is not sufficient representation

500
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:05,839
and so that's why either working I can

501
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:09,019
see where there's an advantage to maybe

502
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:11,628
working with more law firms that have a

503
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,970
presence in multiple countries I don't

504
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:15,138
think that's essential but I think just

505
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,850
finding attorneys and both countries

506
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:18,859
that have a good knowledge base of

507
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:20,269
cannabis and how it relates intellectual

508
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:22,839
property intellectual property relates

509
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:22,839
to campus

510
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:41,098
