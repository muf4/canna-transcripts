[Music]

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,359
whistle if you have your own company

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,800
right

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,359
now whistle if you have your own company

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,278
and you sell

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,480
products whistle if you have your own

8
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,320
company and you sell products and you

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,439
develop

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Partnerships whistle if you communicate

11
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:41,199
with other human beings all

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,799
right the reason I state that is because

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,200
when people hear the term pitch they

14
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,558
often associate it with some sort of a

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,160
Cheesy car salesman activity trying to

16
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,399
sell you this vehicle and you know you

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,398
look really good how do I get you in

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,960
this today it's nothing to do with that

19
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,840
so before we do that I'm going to start

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,640
out with what you shouldn't do if you

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,079
are pitching not talking about Investors

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,359
are very important and we'll go through

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,640
that in a moment normally this is a 3day

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,320
process I'm going to convince it down in

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,198
about 20 minutes and take questions for

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,438
as long as I possibly can to help you

27
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,879
with your business so first and foremost

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,000
here's what it pitch should never be

29
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,719
this is an actual pitch from a company

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,040
uh before they came to us we'll just

31
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,759
call them XYZ XYZ provides professional

32
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,520

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,159
implementation development and value

38
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,719
added software Solutions

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,640
horrible terrible do not explain things

40
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,679
with jargon you know what a great pitch

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,319
says who you are what you do why it's

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,118
important to the other person can you

43
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:45,599
hear me is that better wow that's l so a

44
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,718
good pitch should tell you simply here's

45
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,559
who I am here's what I do here's why

46
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:52,959
it's important to you now developing

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,719
that takes a long time it's very very

48
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,239
difficult to condense your big business

49
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:58,879
and all the spreadsheets you've run and

50
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:00,319
grass and condense it into one simple

51
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,640
thing but some people are really good at

52
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,359
it for instance the rapper Eminem is

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,879
fantastic Adit he has a song that starts

54
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,640
out I don't make black music I don't

55
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,679
make white music I make fight music for

56
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,280
high school kids that's a great pitch

57
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,000
it's simple right think of what you do

58
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,080
and what it provides to other people

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,840
starting a pitch should not begin with

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,519
the great things that you do and how

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,920
much you love your product and huge

62
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,959
words no one understands it's not about

63
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,598
proving how smart you are it's about

64
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,920
proving how well you can communicate

65
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,639
with any level of intelligence okay

66
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,479
great pitch is simple it explains things

67
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,799
in very very simple everyday common

68
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:40,759
person terms so when it comes down to

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,439
understanding what a pitch is I think we

70
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:45,359
have that who you are what you do why

71
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,800
it's important to other people or or in

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,319
particular the person you're talking to

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,760
at the moment so pitches come in very

74
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,079
very different states we're all doing it

75
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,120
you're at a networking event and you

76
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,719
meet someone don't you have to answer

77
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,280
those three questions who are you what

78
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,479
do you do why is it important to me

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,598
right so it's really important you have

80
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,238
this polish sometimes you have 1 minute

81
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,318
on stage to pitch investors sometimes

82
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,039
you have 3 minutes uh people come to us

83
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:12,238
and say I need to develop my 20 minute

84
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:15,479
Ted Talk please if that is in your head

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,039
until Ted calls you himself uh remove it

86
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,079
from your mind it does not matter the

87
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,919
most important thing you can do is

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,840
explain who you are in 15 to 20 seconds

89
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,759
and get intrig the purpose of a great

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,598
pitch what a great pitch does it opens

91
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:32,798
up the the it stimulates dopamine in the

92
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:35,199
mind just like a drug you are selling a

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,799
verbal drug when you are selling a pitch

94
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,280
you have to stimulate the dopamine

95
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,519
someone's bringing o that's interesting

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,199
I have to know more the best result of a

97
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,360
pitch is not how do I write you a check

98
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,359
it's ooh how do you do that or where do

99
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,599
I go from here what's the next step is

100
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,079
to get buying indicators from people so

101
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,438

130
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,960
proficient in marketing in the Cannabis

131

133
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:12,638
let's work on so the first thing who are

134
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,279
you and what you have an interesting

135
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
story you've already shared it right if

136
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,879
I were you the way I would explain my

137
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,160
story and stimulate dopamine is I'm a

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,240
survival to the Cannabis plan because I

turbulence in my life I now believe in

142
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,800
freting of business around the holistic

143
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,240
effects of speaking further into that

144
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,160
why' you get do event planning I do

145
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,400
event planning mostly because the events

146
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,360
I've already been to in LA

147
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,560
are a lot of guys who are getting really

148
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,160
really high and I want to provide

149
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,600

153
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,720

158
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,879

168
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,879
I relate everything to movies by the way

169
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,159
so a great pitch anybody seen Good

170
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,560
Fellas does anybody remember the first

171
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,280
line in the entire

172
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,839
movie for as long as I can remember I've

173
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,559
always wanted to be a

174
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,399
gangster right it sets the tone it tells

175
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,720
you this person has passion and gumption

176
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:49,918
for his chosen career field so in the

177
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,280
same the same context for as long as I

178
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,439
can remember I disliked how things were

179
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,918
branded I decided to take a stance I

180
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,199
look at this industry I understand it

181
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,918
well and now I provide xynz services to

182

183
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:04,079
very important that you explain who you

184
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,280

185
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,639
makes you relatable to me right I don't

186
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,119
care really what your business is or

187
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,519
your p&amp;l or your graphs and spreadsheets

188
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,240
I care about why you do what you do then

189
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:17,079
I care about what you do and then I care

190
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,240
about how we can do it together right so

191
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,800

196
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,199

appreciate it thank you

212
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:04,099
[Applause]

213
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,100
[Music]

214
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,240
so some necessary requirements of a

215
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,079
pitch because you know Todd and I work

216
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,158
together Todd's a partner at 25 Ventures

217
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:16,279
Todd has been on the investment side of

218
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:17,680
you know my bullshit for generations of

219
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,519
being able to pitch products to

220
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,000
investors and actually get capital from

221
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:25,000
them moreover them telling me to kick

222
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,199
rocks more than I can possibly imagine

223
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,120
so if you're not taking enough shots

224
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,520
getting enough failure you're not

225
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
pitching enough people it's just that

226
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,598
simple but from the other side of the

227
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,320
table that's all that counts I can tell

228
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,360
you how to craft something beautiful and

229
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,599
be able to tell an elegant quick story

230
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,519
but you have to know the other side of

231
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,039
the table my career started out managing

232
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,278
money so I totally understand I've been

233
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,799
pitched as well when you're talking to

234
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,600
an investor primarily the first thing

235
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,599
you have to understand is what they

236
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,839
invest in you have to be able to pull

237
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,480
yourself into a bucket quickly I am this

238
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,519
person here's why I do it here's the

239
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,200
company and the bucket I belong in cuz

240
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,879
if you're talking to someone who invests

241
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,959
in you know Elder care might make sense

242
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,078
to talk about cannabis but they're

243
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,838
probably not interested in cannabis

244
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:07,078
space or it's something new to them or

245
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,519
if they're a fund they may not legally

246
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:11,599
be allowed to invest in anything but

247
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,560
elder care so get your background right

248
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,839
away find out who you're pitching to and

249
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,278
then make it interesting to them if you

250
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,040
can figure out right away what bucket

251
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,759
you belong in I'm a software company oh

252
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,679
I I I invest in software I want to

253
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,399
listen more and I've developed this that

254
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,278
does this oo I like the way that that

255
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,000
works now you're building a pitch a cinc

256
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,078
pitch that allows you to communicate

257
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,120
with people

258
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:34,519
because again pitching most people think

259
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,278
is a primary oneway Street where I'm

260
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,959
going to pitch you and and you know I'm

261
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:41,240
going to live this glenary Glenn Ross

262
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:43,599
dream of selling and having nobody buys

263
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,799
anything any longer they want to be part

264
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,720
of what you're doing so you have to

265
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,199
understand that a pitch its primary

266
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,839
purpose is not to get a check it's not

267
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,480
to close the deal it's to interest the

268
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,200
other person and get them to take the

269
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,800
next step everything has a process

270
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,278
investors have a process they meet you

271
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,559
they like you they see your idea they

272
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:04,439
see if it fits into their structure and

273
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,958
and and by the way at the end of the day

274
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,920
investors invest in people they can go

275
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,838
have a drink with that's what they

276
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,199
invest in don't forget you're a human

277
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,600
being don't get caught up in so much

278
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,959
into the science there's a lot of

279
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,278
cannabis companies a lot of science

280
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,199
involved in this get caught up in in the

281
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,838
value it ads as opposed to telling me

282
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,240
and this is the most common mistake

283
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,240
entrepreneurs make when I ask someone

284
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,000
hey what do you do most commonly they

285
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,680
tell me how they do it

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
right they tell them oh well we provide

287
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,319
you know uh software that pulls from

288
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,680
apis or data like at the end of the day

289
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,760
okay you make it easier for me to go

290
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:41,359
from one social network to the other

291
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,639
right remember the value you provide so

292
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,079
if I'm an event planner I'm throwing

293
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,680
events in the Cannabis space I make it

294
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:49,838
amazing to enjoy cannabis with other

295
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,120
people that is actually the value that

296
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,440
you provide it's not the event it's not

297
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,360
the process it's not the how it's the

298
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,600
what it's the value that you get to now

299
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,159
the next this is extremely important

300
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,560
thing to do when you are developing your

301
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,078
pitch okay and of course we can help you

302
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,039
with this we're not here for that when

303
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,120
you're developing your pitch if you

304
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:14,240
cannot explain what you do in six

305
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,159
pictures with no words you don't know it

306
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,680
well enough it's that easy we live in a

307
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,879
world of

308
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,759
degressive communication we are not we

309
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,559
are not moving forward as human beings

310
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,319
text is actually outdated pictures are

311
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,638
how you explain everything they're 100%

312
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,920
said we live in an illustrated World

323
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,760

328
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,560
this is important the fact that right

329
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,119
now while I'm talking to you I have a

330
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,359
pretty good social presence feel free to

331
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,720
find me look me up and connect but I

332
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,839
have a pretty good social presence right

333
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,240
now during this speech I've probably

334
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,240
gotten 25 emails uh there's probably

335
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,720
been 13,000 tweets that have gone

336
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,240
through my message board unknown

337
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,199
hundreds that have gone through Facebook

338
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,039
these are all huge distractions that

339
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:33,359
keep me from actually being able to pay

340
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:36,159
attention to what you're pitching me if

341
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,800
you acknowledge that and take heed of it

342
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,278
right away and understand this person

343
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,639
has the same problems that I have

344
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,039
they're not a Target they're a human

345
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,799
being and they have kids and they have

346
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,240
distractions digital distractions a

347
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,799
device in your pocket that's literally

348
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,799
going off all the time especially if

349
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,879
they're busy people if you can

350
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,439
understand those things you will learn

351
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:57,198
that is really important to be concise

352
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,600
not elaborate all of you have been

353
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:01,799
programmed by our educational system to

354
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,440
fail at pitching do you know

355
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,319
why your teachers God BL God bless their

356
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,480
soul not rest their soul God bless their

357
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,800
soul uh have a very difficult job to do

358
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,199
but what they teach you is backwards we

359
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,958
live in a world right now I have I I I

360
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:18,719
spoke at USC a couple weeks ago and I

361
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,638
literally showed the class of

362
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,399
entrepreneurs who by the way learning

363
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,560
entrepreneurship in school doesn't make

364
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,839
sense either you need to learn it on the

365
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,439
street but I showed them a message from

366
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,839
a very prominent CEO his email to me was

367
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,079
nine work

368
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,120
my reply was three we will get together

369
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:37,000
and discuss this thoroughly in the end

370
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,519
but for right now nine words three words

371
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,600
were sufficient because in the world we

372
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,159
live in we are taught from the time that

373
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,720
we are children hey we're going to do a

374
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,198
paper on Abraham

375
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,199
Lincoln and I want you to write 1,000

376
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:55,399
words about the importance of Abraham

377
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,439
Lincoln couldn't you just as easily

378
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,639
looking put together six bullet points

379
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,600
ended slavery had a cool be shot in the

380
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,360
theater right is is that is that what

381
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,600
your brain actually extracts and flex

382
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,800
but we live in a world of digital

383
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,720
distractions with reduced attention

384
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,399
spans I don't care who you are your

385
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
attention span 10 years ago was a heck

386
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,839
of a lot more than it is today and the

387
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,120
older you get the worse it gets it's

388
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,880
kind of a curve it's a bell curve when

389
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,240
you're little it's very short and then

390
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,639
when you're old it's very very short so

391
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,919
as you get older you have to understand

392
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,720
the older person you're talking to the

393
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,559
less time they have to pay attention

394
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,639
more importantly they're taking in so

395
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:31,479
much information on a daily basis that

396
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,278
you have to become very memorable in

397
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,759
their process extremely memorable

398
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:39,519
everyone here has limited storage space

399
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:43,079
everyone of you see 5 to 8,000 ads per

400
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:47,240
day your eyes take in 100,000 words

401
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:48,519
100,000 words sounds stupid but take a

402
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,519
step outside look at all the words you

403
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,839
see in this room this is all data your

404
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,560
brain is taking in if you do not

405
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,480
understand and know how to navigate that

406
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,039
quickly in entertaining manner that

407
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,920
provides some sort of memorable EXP

408
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,599
experience you are destined to fail

409
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:04,120
pitching there's no Miracle pill I can

410
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,000
give you you need to learn how to

411
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,519
explain who you are what you do why it's

412
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,799
important to other people really quickly

413
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,839
smile on your face with the intent of

414
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:16,639
them saying that's interesting how do

415
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,639
you do that it's really how all comes

416
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,039
down to pitching is not a science it's

417
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,480
an art form and it all comes down to

418
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,958
your ability like I'm not standing up

419
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,920
here with some proper posture in front

420
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:30,039
of be yourself be who you are but

421
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:32,360
explain quickly Who You Are what you do

422
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,919
why it's important now a couple things I

423
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,159
can give you when it comes down to

424
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,838
learning your pitch here are some tips

425
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,399
so if you have a notebook or an iPad an

426
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,199
iPhone I suggest that you write this

427
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,559
shit down because it's pretty

428
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:47,318
important does anyone mind my language

429
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:49,479
my I'm very transparent person um but

430
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:51,639
important thing here identify seven

431
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,079
bullet points about your company the

432
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,318
things that are important what you do

433
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:00,198
why it's different from everyone else so

434
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,519
on so forth seven clear identifying

435
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:03,039
factors that make your business

436
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,519
different from everyone

437
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:09,399
else's put those down memorize them and

438
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:11,639
then put them in order remember a pitch

439
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,159
is nothing but a very very short story

440
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,759
done in verbal and visual format it's a

441
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:20,318
story it all begins with Once upon a

442
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:23,278
time once upon a time some problem

443
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:25,120
existed and every day people experiened

444
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:26,838
this problem and every day things got

445
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,679
worse until one day I had this great

446
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,600
idea to solve this problem and because I

447
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:32,719
saw Sol that problem this this and this

448
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,199
so remember once upon a

449
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,519
time every day every day fill in those

450
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:42,399
lines until one day I had my idea for

451
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,039
the solution and because of the solution

452
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,399
this happens and because of that this

453
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:48,078
happens and then the seventh point at

454
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,480
the end is and everyone

455
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,039
lives this is a story format that is

456
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,399
embedded into you as children that you

457
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:56,559
can follow that's retainable be able to

458
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,399
tell in one minute your Once Upon a Once

459
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,399
Upon a Time story it's extremely

460
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,240
important here's some tips and insights

461
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,400
we generally don't share in the general

462
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,640
public but once you have your seven

463
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,199
items identified chronologically in

464
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,038
order and put it in some way that

465
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,439
doesn't put people to sleep once you

466
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:14,240
have that cool little story these are my

467
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,959
seven points I want you to memorize a

468
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,000
pitch that says who you are what you do

469
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,880
and why it's important and then I want

470
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,558
you to do it with your eyes

471
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,880
closed seriously sounds strange I want

472
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:26,240
everyone in the room to take the butts

473
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,880
of your hands and put your hands

474
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,880
together like this

475
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,720
look at your middle finger one is longer

476
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,599
than the other

477
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,679
right

478
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,000
right one is always longer than the

479
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:45,000
other this is not this is rhetorical one

480
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,440
is always longer than the other so now I

481
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,558
want you to take your hands shake them

482
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,798
out I want you to put your butts of your

483
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,480
hands together and your put your hands

484
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,519
together in the same format close your

485
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,919
eyes and for the next 4 seconds I want

486
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:59,400
your brain to tell your fingers to be

487
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,759
the same length be the same length

488
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,280
be the same length finger middle finger

489
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,919
be the same length with the other finger

490
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:09,158
open your eyes your fingers are the same

491
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,880
length it is undeniable and categorical

492
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,039
the amount of pixelation your eyes take

493
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,280
in is so distracting and defocusing to

494
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,480
your brain waves that you will actually

495
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,519
confuse yourself with your eyes open

496
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,400
saying I can do with my eyes close is

497
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,720
ass backwards it's actually harder then

498
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,759
you're standing stand on one

499
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,558
foot no no no assistance okay put your

500
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,640
foot down stand on one foot with your

501
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:34,359
eyes

502
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,000
closed holy crap is that hard right so

503
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,519
remove when you're trying to put down

504
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,319
your pitch if you close your eyes you

505
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,000
don't see anything so it means you hear

506
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,918
and you produce you produce noise and

507
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,839
you hear noise very clearly and you will

508
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:46,440
hear your own bullshit you will find out

509
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:48,839
what sounds good and what does not sound

510
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,840
good to you immediately it's it's just

511
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,519
it's undeniable not to mention the fact

512
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,000
that these seven bullet points about who

513
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:56,440
you are what you do why it's important

514
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,159
to other people with your eyes open

515
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,038
you'll get five of them nothing your bad

516
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,480
this just everyone everyone gets five of

517
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,960
them all the time and they always those

518
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,400
other two if I have just thrown that in

519
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,519
there it would have been awesome with

520
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,840
your eyes closed you never forget those

521
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,119
other two bullet points if you can and

522
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:15,240
this is proven we work with hundreds and

523
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,439
hundreds of people on this if you can

524
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,919
tell your pitch with your eyes closed

525
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,120
succinctly in the exact format which is

526
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,440
who you

527
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,279
are why it's important to the other

528
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,759
person with your eyes closed and it

529
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,038
sounds good to you it probably sounds

530
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,599
good to other people so make sure that

531
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:34,440
you are following these simple practices

532
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:35,798
so instead of boring you for the 15

533
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,080
minutes which I always advise we teach

534
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:38,960
people if somebody gives you 5 minutes

535
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,798
to pitch learn how to pitch in one and a

536
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,360
half Albert Einstein said it best if you

537
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:46,639
can't explain it simply you don't know

538
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:49,158
it well enough if you know your business

539
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,919
well you can explain it like a dummy to

540
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:53,000
a hillbilly in Arkansas he can

541
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,799
understand your complex business guy

542
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,519
living in the Hills never had a TV he'll

543
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:00,000
get it so what we always advise get to

544
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,440
Q&amp;A that's where imp is made that is

545
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,759
where people get what they want from

546
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,919
what you were saying and that's where

547
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,440
you get to show off how smart you are so

548
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,159

call us a baby nurse but I am really

569
00:20:54,038 --> 00:21:03,038
interested in the way that the canabus

570
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:07,319
industry can help children who have all

571

concise and how am I going to present

574
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,519
this to the public to the phys the

575
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:22,000
question is how do I present cannabis

576
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,798
specifically exactly good so all all of

577
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,640
you have the same stereotypes built into

578
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:27,440
you that the rest we work with we we we

579
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,559
work we are Frontier advisers we work

580
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,519
Frontier Law Group cannabis companies

581
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:34,158
every day and actually Michael we talked

582
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:35,359
about this today with his board they

583
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,880
asked the same question have you done

584
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,639
this before no no one has done this

585
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,480
before in cannabis but the stigma of

586
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,159
cannabis and creating a company that

587
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,278
you're pitching to investors you know

588
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,520
that was called like 5 years it's called

589
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:47,798
drug dealing I need launder money to

590
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:49,839
move and believe me I've been in that

591
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:51,480
business as a college student as well

592
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,959
exactly but in the Cannabis space you

593
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,640
can't explain you're a canab if you

594
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,840
label yourself as a cannabis company

595
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,840
you've automatically eliminated 80% of

596
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,798
potential Partners just stigmas not to

597
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,079
mention the fact that cannabis unless

598
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,359
you are selling Pure Flow or plant in

599
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,240
it's pure format you aren't a cannabis

600
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,719
company you are a hardware company a

601
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,000
beverage company a software company

602
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,200
whatever it may be the fact that

603
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,240
cannabis is a chemical that is involved

604
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,679
in your product should not impact the

605
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,159
way you pitch it whatsoever all it does

606
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,759
is address the market you can and cannot

607
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,320
serve legally that's all so there is no

608
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,079
there there is not a different way to

609
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:32,798
pitch a cannabis company from a software

610
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,038
or a a construction company but all the

611
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,879
same you have a product that product has

612
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,319
a market I want to know how many people

613
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,360
can buy it what you sell it for how

614
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,000
you're going to make money and how

615
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,199
you're going to do this and scale the

616
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,200
business up to the point where it's

617
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,880
worth me putting my money in time so I I

618
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,759
always feel like it's a homeopathic

619
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:56,159
remedy to drugs and that's what infants

620
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:59,839
are given steroids and all kinds of

621
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:02,400
things that are so bad for their human

622
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:05,599
intake so so I'm gonna interrupt you

623
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,600
because uh we hear this a lot a lot so

624
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,119
you we work with a lot of canis

625
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,959
companies and pitches so we hear it all

626
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:14,839
the time um the one thing you can't do

627
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,720
is convert people from their in in one

628
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:19,119
minute you cannot convert them from the

629
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,200
existing stereotype they have in their

630
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,959
brain understanding your way of thinking

631
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,480
you can't so why try so what do you do

632
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,038
you have to explain the core of your

633
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,120
business what you do simply like what is

634
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:32,038
your business that you have do for kids

635
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,879
well right now I'm a baby nurse but I

636
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:39,558
advise people on care for their children

637
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:43,200
who have um unusual circumstances like

638
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:45,319
no um so okay so so in your instance

639
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,440
right now you know you're a child nurse

640
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,200
yes keep it simple and you explore

641
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,600
alternatives to traditional medicines

642
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,558
and pharmaceuticals to provide better

643
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,278
solutions to children with less damaging

644
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:58,079
impact exactly you don't need to use the

645
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,960
word cannabis no in a pitch I just want

646
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,519
you I want you to say one thing to me

647
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,640
when I'm done with my pitch how do you

648
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:06,038
do that and then I will tell you I do it

649
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,240
through using CBD or canis how do you do

650
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:11,359
that I just did

651
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,519
it you explain the fact that you a nurse

652
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,519
and that you explore natural and

653
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,440
homeopathic alternatives for children to

654
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,278
provide the same results if not better

655
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,640

709
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:27,000
in the process of taking over my dad's

710
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,120
35-year-old company which is packaging

711
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,679
machinery and robotic which goes into

712
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,678
how everything gets

713
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,000
packaged I'm very interested in speaking

714
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,759
with you automated right and U I just

715
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,798
started an offsho called canpac USA

716
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:45,398
which is specifically Niche marketed for

717
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:46,720
the Cannabis industry just with site

718
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:48,278
makes it Niche now there's the other

719
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,798
thing the other stigma in the Cannabis

720
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:51,759
industry is there's a lot of fakers in

721
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:55,440
the space there's a lot of people that

722
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:57,440
say oh yeah I do this for cannabis

723
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,798
there's really no difference in how you

724
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,720
Market Pres present promote sell

725
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:03,720
products there's none there's no reason

726
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,440
to coin yourself or pin yourself in

727
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,558
there you're providing for a new

728
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,880
industry right so what do you do

729
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:10,440
differently is there anything from a

730
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,520
robotics or packaging that you do any

731
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,720
differently than you did before uh

732
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,960
mainly from the legislative standpoint

733
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,798
we had a situation recently uh so it's

734
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,440
compliance packaging you're comping St

735
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:24,879
staying up with the legislation

736
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,519
specifically in Colorado um California

737
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,720
and the other states where legislation

738
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,119
can

739
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,120
dictate how much how does legislation

740
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,398
impact

741
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:36,519
packaging it it impacts from the

742
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,439
standpoint of how many milligrams or

743
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,319
milliliters of THC can go into a certain

744
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,919
bottle and those

745
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:46,798
bottles uh the Machinery that fills

746
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,120
those bottles are custom made so so I I

747
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,720
get it the question I'm tring to make

748
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,678
sure we get every speci the question is

749
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,399
what's that you're taking over your

750
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,559
dad's industry your dad's 35-year-old

751
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:56,959
company and you're moving it into the

752
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:59,519
Cannabis space because another another

753
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,240
Market of it and what happened was is

754
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,919
when I was going on as Burmeister

755
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:08,120
packaging nobody was really listening

756
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:10,759
per se so when I started canac USA and

757
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:12,678
been promoting it as that now people

758
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:14,119
seem to be listening a little bit more

759
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,559
but I was wanting to

760
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:20,959
know how can I penetrate the market

761
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:22,960
more as an expert both legislatively

762
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,319
speaking because that has a lot to do

763
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,519
with the types of machinery and Robotics

764
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,000
that are used in the filling the capping

765
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,720
question penetrate the market so

766
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,159
penetrating the market is a go to market

767
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,640
marketing Strate we we do all this stuff

768
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,519
I don't have that answer for you if I'm

769
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,759
just being frank and I don't know enough

770
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,120
but what I can tell you is it all starts

771
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,079
with your ability to explain what

772
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:44,359
differentiates you from the rest of the

773
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,158
worldly so being able to explain the

774
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:48,439
fact that your packaging follow state

775
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,480
laws and compliance for cannabis

776
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,120
companies would be my Niche I wouldn't

777
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,079
promote it as a Canabis company I would

778
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:59,000
promote it as a manufacturing and

779
00:28:55,079 --> 00:29:01,199
packaging company that follows can State

780
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,839
regulation that removes you from

781
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,240
stereotype and it immediately puts you

782
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,319
into a position of authority gotcha

783
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,000
thank you very much you bet anyone

784
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,000
else one more one

785
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:19,200
[Music]

786
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:21,240
more none none more oh there we

787
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,840
go grab that

788
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,960
mic you're tonight's rapper go thec go

789
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:30,558
specific that women should do while

790
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,120
pitching that and tend not to do like

791
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,038
I'm glad you as this cuz there's a lot

792
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,479
yeah there's a lot of stigma I think

793
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,278
especially I'm from Valley in terms of

794
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,480
investment I'm so this is actually the

795
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,679
way I was going to start but my

796
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,880
background if you don't know anything

797
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,440
about me I've been working with women

798
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,519
entrepreneurs since before you were

799
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,679
called women entrepreneurs when you were

800
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:52,278
simply entrepreneurs uh I was part of

801
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,120
the team that broke the actual

802
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:56,960
information and statistical breakdown of

803
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:58,678
venture capital realizing that 74% of

804
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,440
all venture capital returns Returns come

805
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,480
from women L Investments which account

806
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,919
for less than 9% of their actual

807
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,200
allocated funds does that make sense to

808
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,559
you so 9% of their Investments go to

809
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,000
women who produce 74% of their money

810
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,798
that's asinine so the fact that that

811
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,558
even exists and the stigma is one that I

812
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:16,879
don't try to promote but I'm happy to

813
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:18,839
answer your questions I've been doing

814
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,320
this for more than a decade with women I

815
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:23,158
work with springboard Enterprises

816
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,519
largest women Le Enterprises how do

817
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,880
women pitch differently than men they

818
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:29,278
don't it's not necessarily in what you

819
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,080
say women tend to a little longer winded

820
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,919
because of a lack of confidence I'm a

821
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,519
you you've already also labeled yourself

822
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,120
in your brain by saying I'm a woman

823
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,679
entrepreneur so it means you try to

824
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:39,959
prove that you're smart way harder than

825
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,440
everyone else but in actuality the women

826
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,120
who explain things in very few words

827
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,558
pause and look at the bridge of your

828
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:49,678
nose sell whatever they want to anyone

829
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:51,240
the fact that you are succinct just like

830
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,440
men there is no difference there's no

831
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,960
sexism in pitching there's none either

832
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,120
you have a good pitch good business or

833
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,120
you don't the fact that you're a woman

834
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,000
is only a hinder

835
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:03,239
before you get on stage and Pitch once

836
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,480
you're on stage you're an entrepreneur

837
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,319
so the secret sauce for women is to

838
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,720
learn how to be more succin than men

839
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,359
because I can tell and Todd will back

840
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,880
this up Todd how much do you hate

841
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:17,558
hearing 35 minute pitches about a

842
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,399
company I think I've listened to over

843
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:22,480
15,000 pitches and it's brutally

844
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,359
horrible to sit behind lots of money

845
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,599
they want to put it to work have to wait

846
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,839
through that and only invest through

847
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:32,119
five companies a year have to 6,000 a

848
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:34,398
year it's brutal please make it short

849
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:37,119
shorten it up be concise be Illustrated

850
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,638
women have much first of obviously we

851
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,038
support women L businesses we work with

852
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:43,918
a ton of them but women have a better

853
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:46,038
ability to explain things in pictures

854
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,840
see the way the pitching works is I tell

855
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:50,158
you a beautiful story like you're a

856
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,759
child I look at you and I tell you about

857
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,039
once upon a time that there was this big

858
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,398
problem that my idea became came to a

859
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,000
head when I realized it was an actual

860
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,398
problem here's how I figured it all out

861
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,398
speed you up and I get you excited the

862
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:04,079
entire time behind me is a PowerPoint if

863
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,398
that PowerPoint this is what women do

864
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,960
all the time by the way if that

865
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:08,959
PowerPoint says word for word what I'm

866
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,798
saying to you what the hell am I doing

867
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,120
in the room but if that PowerPoint shows

868
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:16,200
an illustration of what I just said just

869
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,079
an illustration it embeds it

870
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,519
neurologically in someone's head I see

871
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,839
it I hear it I see it I hear it I see it

872
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:26,359
I hear it I see it women are so good at

873
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:28,359
this it's unbelievable just un uncor

874
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:30,519
that part of you that and let your

875
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:33,558
creative juices go when you pitch

876
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:35,000
verbally pitch like a very short M AR

877
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:36,798
