2
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:22,768
so I've been farming cannabis for about

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:26,160
16 years of my farm and we are sun-grown

4
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:29,879
primarily we do organic farming like Oh

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,549
bub and beyond organic methods and we

6
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:36,179
live in Redwood Valley which is in

7
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:38,339
Mendocino County and our spot is really

8
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,439
unique we're up on the top of a hill and

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,510
we have amazing sunshine all day and we

10
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,449
don't really have a fog influence so in

11
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:47,968
our farm we grow a lot of strains that

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:50,460
do well without getting powdery mildew

13
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,250
they're pretty disease resistant and bug

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,739
resistant and in our little zone have a

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,679
kind of a prime location of of Sun all

16
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,058
day so my husband is a breeder and he's

17
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,729
been doing some of his own proprietary

18
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:05,548
genetics for the last 20 years and at

19
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:08,938
our farm for about 16 and so we focus on

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,270
a couple of strains one originally like

21
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:14,399
a true cush and we bred that in with a

22
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:17,429
Romulan cross which we now we have it

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,080
the true Barrymore and she does really

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,890
great she doesn't get powdery mildew at

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,810
all and super strong indica and so that

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,969
does really great at our place and also

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,640
some of her sister strains other

28
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,228
phenotypes of the same genetics looking

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,849
at like the blue whale is one of our

30
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:37,170
also one of our other proprietary

31
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:40,048
genetics we work with the lemon fire -

32
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,500
which is a great lemon fire OG which is

33
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:48,000
a great sativa strain that does super

34
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,399
well in our area as well those are kind

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,009
of like our top strains I would say of

36
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,810
our farm and things that we focus on

37
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,228
with our brand our kind of

38
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:02,079
so we mix the natural soil with

39
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:04,239
nutrients and then we also do pots smart

40
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,158
pots around the property I'm doing some

41
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,019
boxes this year and kind of mixing it up

42
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,280
a little bit trying out some different

43
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,330
methods the boxes are brand new it's

44
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,520
something that we haven't done before

45
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,260
but we're having good luck with it with

46
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,580
water retention and the plants are

47
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:21,310
happier and we're kind of doing more

48
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,469
like hedgerows this year and kind of

49
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,479
doing like trellising over the top

50
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:27,879
instead of our usual bamboo method like

51
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,689
we have been doing in the past that's so

52
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:32,139
far so good

53
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:33,459
it's working out pretty well exactly

54
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:35,559
yeah so we used to do you know we were

55
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:37,239
in the 9.31 program in Mendocino County

56
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,489
which was an exemption program we had

57
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,890
the 10,000 square feet exemption for our

58
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:44,170
property and so we did that for a few

59
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:46,750
years and this year we're still within

60
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:49,719
the 10,000 square foot model but we

61
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,580
decided that we're gonna shift it up a

62
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,560
little bit and so we can count our

63
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,989
square footage by the estimated

64
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,599
circumference of how big the plant is

65
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:00,459
going to get which is kind of who knows

66
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,349
you know how do you estimate that from

67
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:05,590
the beginning I don't know but we do our

68
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:07,479
best and so we kind of tried some other

69
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,969
methods to maximize square footage and

70
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,679
so far it seems great like we thought we

71
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:13,209
were over 10,000 square feet but when we

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,430
did all the counts we're actually only

73
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,739
like 7,500 which was way more manageable

74
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,959
for us it's ten thousand square feet we

75
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,860
really need like three or four full-time

76
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,719
people on that square footage farm and

77
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,130
that's a big job 10,000 square feet like

78
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:29,349
there's a hundred by a hundred but it's

79
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:31,329
really not it's spread out there's a lot

80
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:34,209
of different jobs to do there's a lot of

81
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:36,250
upkeep as you know like as they get

82
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,920
bigger and just trying to like keep up

83
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,419
with them more than anything so every

84
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,039
time every year has been a little bit of

85
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,439
a new experiment so we keep trying

86
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:46,289
different methods and figuring out what

87
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,699
we like best and going with that and

88
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:52,719
seeing how it works and then next year

89
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:55,030
maybe wipe out one method and go with

90
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,280
what worked better so we're kind of

91
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,799
narrowing that down and also like seeing

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,659
which plants which genetics do better in

93
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,580
the natural soil mixed with the

94
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:06,699
nutrients versus the smart

95
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,010
versus the box - I think that a lot of

96
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:11,199
our terracing was kind of dug out we

97
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:14,739
live on the top of an OP like a rock

98
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:17,229
Knoll and so we had to create some soil

99
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,449
in the very beginning so long long time

100
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,290
ago so it has kind of like maybe

101
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:23,399
naturalized

102
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:26,770
is a good term I don't know exactly but

103
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,899
we've sort of like tilled in new stuff

104
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:31,089
and over the years we keep like adding

105
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:34,239
to it and it has kind of created this

106
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:36,639
sort of like topsoil in our garden which

107
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,769
was never there before we sifted out

108
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,919
thousands of pounds of rocks to get

109
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:43,810
actual soil where we are so that's how

110
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,040
we started which was a long time ago and

111
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,410
you know now things are like really

112
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,930
flourishing and happy and doing good in

113
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:54,460
that environment we do compost tea brews

114
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:56,110
mostly for like good bacteria not so

115
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:58,930
much feeding like I feel like a lot of

116
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,270
our goodness comes from the soil itself

117
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,610
and this year we got a bad soil

118
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:08,019
recommendation that kind of went awry

119
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:11,050
and so the soil well I'm not gonna get

120
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:12,310
into names or whatever but we had a soil

121
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,730
mixture that we thought was a lot

122
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,899
stronger than it was and the plants

123
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,189
weren't doing that great and we're gonna

124
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,569
like what is going on maybe there's

125
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:21,279
another issue so we got into really

126
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:24,849
looking at like maybe there was

127
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,709
something with some pests or something

128
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,939
else so we started researching it and

129
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:29,949
then my husband is like I'm just gonna

130
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:32,168
go back and look at the company where we

131
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:33,819
got the soil from and really has started

132
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:35,769
looking into it and did some tests on it

133
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:37,810
and was like oh shit this doesn't have

134
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:40,870
anything in it so we started packing

135
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,810
doing more topdressing and packing it

136
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,790
for more nutrients with the compost tea

137
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,680
and that seems to help a lot and it

138
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,939
helps to mitigate other issues to that

139
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,150
plants really love it that live

140
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:54,149
bacterial brew

141
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:11,879
