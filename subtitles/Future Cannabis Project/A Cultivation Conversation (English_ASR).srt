2
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:12,570
I've noticed that it seems like the

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:15,179
industry is really in a stage of trying

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,310
to just get by and that's kind of the

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,230
main focus for most people when they're

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,299
starting cultivation sites is I've seen

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,368
the mentality switched from like what's

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,289
the best site we can build to what is

9
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,960
the minimum we can build to get started

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,820
and trying a lot more technologies

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,730
coming in that are scalable and I can

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,200
start it a lot smaller set up so that

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,089
people can just actually establish

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,859
revenue and get moving before they try

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,059
to like build out this massive project

16
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:40,378
that they're not sure if they're

17
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:44,070
actually going to be able to make any

18
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:46,259
money operating that's cool actually so

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,820
you are seeing scalable where you can

20
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,878
kind of start from the beginning at a

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,770
lower budget I'm seeing that the I'm

22
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,599
seeing that's what people are going for

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,629
more so and that there's a lot more tech

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,370
coming to the market that enables people

25
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:01,108
to do that I'm not so sure that's still

26
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:02,878
exactly the best approach I think you

27
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,549
get a lot more efficiency by building

28
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,459
everything as one unit especially on the

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,820
HVAC side just having integrated systems

30
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:15,298
that can share Heat loops and actually

31
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,949
like move heat between different spaces

32
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,720
and you know I've seen these like

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,329
massive water loop systems where they're

34
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,709
just pulling heat out of every day every

35
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:24,209
unit inside of all the different spaces

36
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,649
so that you know even if you're running

37
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,269
on different timers or if you have

38
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,040
different dehumidification needs and

39
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:32,129
your reheat coil is not sizeable enough

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,719
you can still be pulling heat out of

41
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,310
these other spaces to make sure that you

42
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,188
have enough to be able to dehumidifier

43
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:42,990
inside the space and anyway the point is

44
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:45,000
that there's this there's always these

45
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,679
little band-aids being created in the

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,060
industry right now to just kind of like

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,990
make it easier for people to get started

48
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,640
because I think it's probably just

49
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:57,000
because there's so many projects that

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,379
have just not really finished and so

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,590
people are trying to address this need

52
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:04,188
as people are a little more timid about

53
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,450
dumping a ton of cash into a project now

54
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:08,848
yeah that's kind of the hard part

55
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,890
having the for one having the cash to

56
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,229
dump in right investors are getting a

57
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,708
lot more frugal finding companies now

58
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:16,378
there's

59
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,900
you give me your capital this is what I

60
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:20,578
could do we're not profitable yet or we

61
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,408
haven't even started yet we're still in

62
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,329
a full startup phase but we're gonna

63
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:27,750
need five million dollars to build out

64
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:30,060
our cultivation facility those are the

65
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,769
dots it was ever easy but it seems like

66
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,920
it's getting substantially harder now

67
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:37,139
than it was well I think people have

68
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,259
learned a lot from the lessons of the

69
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,310
past few years of the industry and

70
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,929
what's been going on at the Canadian

71
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,030
markets definitely created a lot of

72
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,159
scare and hysteria in the industry and

73
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,658
I'm so sure that it really applies that

74
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:51,989
much to what's really happening in the

75
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:55,679
US but it's definitely changed the

76
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,329
atmosphere a lot but I I definitely

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,389
think it's much better for people to

78
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:02,430
actually have a proof-of-concept done

79
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,829
before they try to invest five million

80
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,689
dollars into a project and at least have

81
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,489
demonstrated on some small scale that

82
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:10,318
you can produce a product and you can

83
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,120
get it to market or you can at least

84
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,699
create some sort of distribution system

85
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,930
and/or relationships with retailers that

86
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:20,509
actually works and then try to scale up

87
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,400
your system but I'm not I'm still not

88
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:26,189
convinced that you know trying to build

89
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,989
one building with in in sequence and

90
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:29,430
just setting up individual rooms one of

91
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,109
the time is the best approach just

92
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,260
because of the efficiency losses you're

93
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:36,750
gonna have in the long term for your

94
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:38,848
HVAC systems yeah the HVAC is a big one

95
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,560
with that I know that you know I can

96
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:42,568
remember with us when we originally

97
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,919
started out you know it was kind of

98
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:45,539
always that way where you'd grow in a

99
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,889
basement and then you'd move to a new

100
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,209
house in a new basement and you knew it

101
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:50,120
was gonna take a certain amount of time

102
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,109
before that basement was gonna start

103
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,389
yielding you're gonna have to figure out

104
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:57,479
your space and your environment and then

105
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:59,639
went from a basement to you know a small

106
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:03,449
you know 2,000 square foot shop and

107
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:05,159
those lessons were multiplied you're

108
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,709
like whoa I'm building rooms now I don't

109
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:08,938
have the regular my HVAC system in my

110
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,408
house is and what's keeping the house

111
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:12,780
warm and there's different airflow

112
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:15,840
tracks and humidity is different and and

113
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,459
that's expensive and and then to look at

114
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,548
somebody who's figured that out in a in

115
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:24,689
a shop and say now you need to go to

116
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:27,419
vertical racks automation LED light you

117
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:29,879
know find efficiencies everywhere

118
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,420
from trimming all the way through how

119
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:36,029
you mix nutrient scare people to death a

120
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,620
lot of times and I get it like it's not

121
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:39,539
like you can just make a mistake and go

122
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,430
to the bank and have a cushion loan yeah

123
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,970
it's a hard commitment for people and I

124
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,470
sympathize because you know well I'm

125
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,630
always talking about this is what you

126
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,250
got to do you have to like you said we

127
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:52,019
have to build it efficient from a start

128
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,180
because the amount of money that you

129
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:56,579
lose trying to shut everything down and

130
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,620
the shelf space the problems you can run

131
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:01,979
into when you completely revamp and

132
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,060
relearn that whole lesson that's that's

133
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,080
a difficult thing to do if you're

134
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,300
self-funded but what what do you do yeah

135
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,669
it's a it's definitely I think it's the

136
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,819
biggest crux for for the small

137
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,680
entrepreneurial cultivator you know I

138
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,540
can definitely see how it's it's hard to

139
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,430
adopt to that new model and I don't

140
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,600
think that that model of you know what

141
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,310
you're talking about vertical racking

142
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,840
and LEDs and really efficient equipment

143
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,100
that's certainly not been the standard

144
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,250
and that's certainly not what people are

145
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,590
accustomed to and I'm not sure it's

146
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,120
really complete yet the ideas and

147
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:36,689
concepts that are really going to be

148
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,980
effective in that space but there's

149
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,509
there's still just so much research that

150
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,490
has to be done and I really wish there

151
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:45,120
were more people that were interested in

152
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,949
uncovering what truths we don't have yet

153
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,530
in terms of cultivation and what are the

154
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:51,180
most efficient practices we're really

155
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:53,219
relying on a lot of assumptions that are

156
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,980
being fed to us by equipment

157
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:00,480
manufacturers and there's not you know

158
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:03,060
due to its its status as a narcotic for

159
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,490
most of the world you know this is

160
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,310
mostly about cannabis cultivation ok can

161
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,949
you talk about either some research you

162
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,449
have done or are doing or that other

163
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:15,379
people are doing that you've been

164
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:20,279
following that you find interesting

165
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:23,159
sure there's not a lot what I was gonna

166
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,469
say was because of its status there's

167
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,200
not been a ton of opportunity for

168
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,850
academic institutions to really dig in

169
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,349
on crops and understand it dig in on

170
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,970
this crop and understand how to best

171
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,490
grow it and what are the little nuances

172
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,290
about it and that's been done with many

173
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,699
other crops and it's they're kind of

174
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,680
boring at this point because they've

175
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,639
just been researched so much so we don't

176
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,139
really

177
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,908
you don't really have any more questions

178
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:48,718
about what light spectrums right for

179
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:51,149
them or at least in maybe we have

180
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:52,498
curiosities but we can't really turn

181
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:54,748
them into something that's going to be

182
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:56,370
that effective in the industry it's just

183
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:59,550
a few little details that we're

184
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,189
wondering about now but me personally

185
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,718
I've been really fixated on nutrient

186
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:06,090
research for cannabis just because

187
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:09,028
there's not you know when I first got

188
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:10,619
started I just like found every single

189
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,509
nutrient product I could get my hands on

190
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,699
in the industry found out everything

191
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,528
that was inside of it found out followed

192
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,360
all their feed schedules looked at what

193
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:19,860
the ppm for every single nutrient was

194
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,750
for every week by week that they

195
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,158
recommended and what what was the

196
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,199
phosphate levels they thought should be

197
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:26,728
going on in week four why did they add

198
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,520
in this other mix and what level were

199
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:30,930
they aiming for and there's not one

200
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,370
nutrient brand that's the same as the

201
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,069
other they're all totally different from

202
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,838
one another so I just started doing my

203
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,088
own trial so I was buying every single

204
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:41,939
individual salt nutrient calcium nitrate

205
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:44,009
potassium nitrate magnesium nitrate mkp

206
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:47,210
potassium sulfate everything all the

207
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:50,069
micros and just making my own blends and

208
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:52,198
seaton testing them testing different

209
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,120
ratios of each nutrient together trying

210
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,009
to find what ratios people were going

211
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,769
for in different products and seeing

212
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:01,050
what actually worked and it really

213
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:03,329
doesn't need a lot of nutrition is what

214
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,250
I found it's a pretty light feeding crop

215
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:06,899
in general I mean you can push it but

216
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,639
you tend to create more issues for

217
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,560
yourself when you push it if you feed it

218
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,418
a ton of nitrogen to try to get it to

219
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,699
veg out a lot faster than you end up

220
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:16,378
putting on tons of little more nodes

221
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,060
that are trying to branch out and so you

222
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:19,889
have to deal with a lot more pruning and

223
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,560
you end up kind of making the plant more

224
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:23,879
susceptible to pests infection in my

225
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,050
opinion when you're over feeding the

226
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,460
plant you see a lot more water damage so

227
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,110
I mean that's what's gonna I was

228
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,968
focusing on mostly just nutrient

229
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,610
research and I found you don't really

230
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,560
need near as much potassium is what most

231
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,360
people are doing for like tomato crops

232
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:44,250
and pepper crops for their feeding these

233
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,589
like 2 to 2.5 to 3 to 4 EC levels with

234
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,379
like 300 ppm potassium you know you can

235
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:52,860
be more down to like 150 it doesn't need

236
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:54,689
to be that high in your nitrogen and

237
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,409
potassium ratios can be pretty close to

238
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,690
one another

239
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,969
the ppm levels can be pretty close to

240
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,770
one another it's it's it's not unlike

241
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,790
it's not like that for many crops but a

242
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:04,949
lot of the information that's available

243
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:06,629
has when I really started digging into

244
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,180
some of the publication's it's from

245
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,970
fertilizer manufacturer saying you need

246
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:14,609
this much potassium and it doesn't

247
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,960
really make a lot of sense I'm not sure

248
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,500
it really works it just ends up in the

249
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,360
groundwater really so and that's another

250
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,009
issue is just the eutrophication effects

251
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,389
that come from over feeding these plants

252
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:26,340
and then going back into the groundwater

253
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:30,210
or into our well municipal water systems

254
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,860
and so that's where I saw a ton of gaps

255
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,690
in knowledge and you know we talked

256
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,279
about a lot about light spectrum these

257
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,750
days and I see a lot of people doing

258
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,379
light spectrum research I'm not sure

259
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,940
I've seen a ton that really made me

260
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,649
learn that much more than what I learned

261
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,140
in schools I mean I went to I had a

262
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,329
master's in horticulture and so I

263
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:49,889
studied a lot photo biology it was doing

264
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,700
a project about growing plants in the

265
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:55,080
international space station and you know

266
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,820
there's a lot of interesting things to

267
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,259
see but there's not a lot of interesting

268
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,170
changes that have happened over the past

269
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:02,279
10 years far red lights been really

270
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:04,199
interesting people are talking about

271
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:07,110
adding far red light to the mix and

272
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,420
that's because there was something it

273
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,120
was some work being done at UGA where

274
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:14,009
they were just looking at different

275
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,299
effects on photo siskel and the

276
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,799
different photo systems and how it

277
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,079
changes based on the red to farhad

278
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,699
ratios and I think they're calling to

279
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,470
Emerson enhancement effect was this old

280
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,450
paper that came out a long time ago and

281
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,060
they were kind of bringing back shedding

282
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,980
light on how far red light was relevant

283
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,479
for photosynthesis and there was some

284
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,940
good findings there but I haven't seen

285
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,539
it really integrated in a light that's

286
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,250
being heavily commercialized yet but

287
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,730
it's also quite available in other types

288
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:44,399
of lights besides LEDs but you've

289
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:47,009
mentioned kind of growing with kind of

290
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,129
salt based nutrients and stuff are you

291
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:53,669
oh you know do you explore like I'm

292
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:55,289
actually I have my YouTube channel open

293
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:59,579
where the most recent videos Korean

294
00:10:55,289 --> 00:11:02,370
natural farming topic are are you doing

295
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:07,440
any kind of stuff that explores like

296
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:09,139
adding microbes and yeah I fungal you

297
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,059
know I'm not a big believer that

298
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,499
and I prefer to grow in indoor

299
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:14,269
environments greenhouse environments I

300
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:15,739
love outdoor production but I mean you

301
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:18,379
kind of you got to be fortunate with a

302
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:20,059
good piece of land and it's it's it's

303
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,980
not that easy to find a good place to

304
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:22,969
grow cannabis it's it's you know there's

305
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,470
a lot of people are really fortunate

306
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,329
have a great place to grow up good

307
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,678
weather good soil and that's it's

308
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:28,938
awesome they should keep doing it but a

309
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:31,278
lot of people they have to deal with

310
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,899
pretty harsh climates and it's a lot

311
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:39,230
easier just to do it indoors or in a

312
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:41,778
greenhouse I do use a lot of microbial

313
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,688
products but I primarily just focus on

314
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:47,509
like compost compost blends of

315
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:52,208
vermicompost I don't think you can

316
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:55,759
really effectively cultivate microbes or

317
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:58,578
mycelium or mycorrhizae in in a pot in

318
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,470
such a short life cycle of a plant so I

319
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:01,698
think it's you'll get some but I think

320
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,548
it's just kind of a waste of money so

321
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:05,778
what I try to focus on just producing a

322
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:08,239
real good really good

323
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:09,980
vermicompost make it make a tea or

324
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:12,410
extract out of it and just apply it to

325
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,259
the roots so that there's a living

326
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:17,178
ecosystem of microbes being added to the

327
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:18,678
mix and I'm also using salt nutrients

328
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:20,869
but I try to keep it really low and I

329
00:12:18,678 --> 00:12:22,850
take time to just feed them plants just

330
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:25,399
water and from a compost tea to try to

331
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:29,149
keep a living population of microbes

332
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:30,708
growing in the soil but I'm not going to

333
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,208
be dependent on an inoculum for that I'm

334
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,068
going to be constantly adding just

335
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,748
living solution to it so I'm not there's

336
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:38,389
no lag time for me to wait for it to

337
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:41,899
colonize my roots or to get acclimated

338
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:44,808
to the new zone yeah you know when we

339
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:46,339
were working at eco on kind of looking

340
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:47,149
at nutrient that was coming we were

341
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,319
coming at it from a little different

342
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,778
angle which I found really interesting

343
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:52,068
we had a resource to be able to pick our

344
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:53,720
plants take our matter in from the

345
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:55,278
plants at week one week two whenever we

346
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,319
wanted and be able to test leaves and

347
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,879
the nutrient nutrient content of the

348
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,469
leaves at the different stages and the

349
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,899
different plants and it got really

350
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,069
interesting you know because we we were

351
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:07,999
working closely with an automation

352
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:09,918
system for our fertigation and so they

353
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:11,778
were actually designing a system for us

354
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:13,730
so that we could down to the milliliter

355
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:15,828
track exactly how much nutrient was

356
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,989
going to exactly which plants and then

357
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:20,388
we could tie that into our cultivation

358
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:21,610
to look like over time exactly how much

359
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:23,440
our yields were in

360
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,240
into our feed programs as it went up and

361
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,350
down and then when we started playing

362
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,970
with the nutrient and testing those

363
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,810
levels in the plants for mobile and semi

364
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:34,000
mobile we found cool stuff like same

365
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:36,009
room same environment we've got

366
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,929
pineapple cush here and we've got the

367
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:41,278
Flav here and we're feeding them the

368
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:44,439
same regiment and the Flav is holding a

369
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,778
hundred and fifty ppm of phosphorous and

370
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,450
the pineapple cush is at three thousand

371
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:51,700
yeah and it was like totally different

372
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,620
uptake mechanisms yeah and then starting

373
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,220
to play with within that uptake what

374
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,799
does it want

375
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,139
does the Flav want to be at 3,000 or

376
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,879
does it want to be at 150 and what being

377
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:03,429
able to track through our yields and

378
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,899
then obviously economically track

379
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:08,349
through how much nutrient we're using

380
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:10,360
and when slowly but surely you could get

381
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,519
to that point where you can start

382
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,470
documenting this plant likes to eat this

383
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,470
for its maximum yield or its maximum

384
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:21,519
potency and if I'm making a live resin

385
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:24,639
versus a joint yeah and you know it's a

386
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,350
long project but I like sure yeah it's

387
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,000
great and I really wish people were more

388
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,399
focused on that right now and something

389
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,519
I've really been digging in on and

390
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,039
trying to understand as much as I can

391
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,389
but yeah it's in how do those things

392
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:39,309
change with different environments is

393
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:41,198
also interesting you know if you if you

394
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:43,088
upgrade your lighting system and now

395
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,948
you've got much more ppfd in the space

396
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:47,170
how how's your nutrients how is your

397
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:49,419
nutrient regimen going to change in

398
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:51,578
response to that and is it just a matter

399
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:53,379
of like this plant likes this level of

400
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:54,939
ratios of nutrients and all you got to

401
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:56,799
do is scale it up when you when it's

402
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,170
under in a more intense environment or

403
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,469
does it stay the same and it does more

404
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:04,719
with less like yeah go through that

405
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:07,180
grower curse or at least I do all right

406
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,920
I've gotten better at it but the throw

407
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:10,359
too many things at once you know we've

408
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:12,219
done one experiment it liked it now

409
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,470
let's change the temperature let's

410
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,879
change the light spectrum hold on how

411
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,500
about we just do the same experiment two

412
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,448
or three times and get like a nice field

413
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,240
of data and then change one thing

414
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:24,578
yeah and it's painfully slow but that's

415
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,079
what it takes and that's that's why we

416
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:28,120
need a lot more people doing it and

417
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,639
talking about it and because we're

418
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,490
wasting a lot of resources by not

419
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,830
getting these answers just just quickly

420
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,480
with

421
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,879
you had mentioned can you be specific

422
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,560
about like a cultivar that you grew and

423
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,850
what you may have done different if you

424
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,389
knew you were growing it for flower

425
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:47,850
versus extraction so we were just

426
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:50,370
starting that when we had sold the

427
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,649
company and then when we exited that

428
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:56,940
endeavor in what is now a multinational

429
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:59,220
lawsuit so super fun to watch all that

430
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,440
research kind of go down the drain but

431
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,180
we were just getting to the point to

432
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,940
where yes we were starting to look at

433
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:08,159
mono cropping whole rooms because that

434
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,910
feed schedule for that specific plant

435
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,559
was going to produce at a flower level

436
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:15,449
so much higher than the others in the

437
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:18,119
room that we were starting to do kind of

438
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,770
the economic balance of okay why are we

439
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,009
growing this drain with three other

440
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:25,110
strains three times a year when we could

441
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:26,909
grow at once in one room one time a year

442
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,680
and that is perfect for our flower

443
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:30,269
production and then we're not going to

444
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:32,099
deal with putting it with all these

445
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,659
other plants where it doesn't react the

446
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,120
same but you couldn't see it with the

447
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,370
naked eye like the plant was happy and

448
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,639
healthy with six other strains in the

449
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:44,220
room created great flower sold just fine

450
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,139
but economically once we started to keep

451
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,450
track of that data that was where we

452
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,279
started to realize there is a different

453
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:53,160
methodology to how we need to consider

454
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:56,970
cultivation for our efficiencies so that

455
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:58,980
we're not once again wasting nutrient

456
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:02,070
and power because I need to boost it up

457
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:05,400
for you or bring it down for you yeah

458
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,779
and you know they'll tolerate a range of

459
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,769
you know when you're over feeding them

460
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:09,209
are under feeding them they have a

461
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:12,269
tolerance and which they'll deal with

462
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:15,180
that but you it it's a lot harder to

463
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:17,490
really track the the small effects that

464
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,810
lead to macro scale effects later on the

465
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,220
plant's growth because it's all

466
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:22,230
compounding you know if you're just kind

467
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,940
of five percent hurting it because it's

468
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,980
getting overfed this one nutrient will

469
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,590
buy an eight week cycle that's it adds

470
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,329
up to a lot even if it seems like a

471
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:33,000
minor stress you can't identify with the

472
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:34,470
naked eye there's something that can be

473
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,029
monitored just through analytical

474
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,789
equipment and actually paying attention

475
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:40,230
and doing structured research but I

476
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:42,659
think it always needs to stay very

477
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,009
applied for this industry right now

478
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,529
because there's just a lot of catch up

479
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:47,490
to do yeah yeah and that you know was

480
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,430
one of the things I loved about the

481
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,079
automation equipment

482
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,730
which i've I've had people in the past

483
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,220
kind of reference to me like you're

484
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,740
taking away jobs and you know to be

485
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,140
clear we're not taking away jobs I'm

486
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,509
actually just refocusing that's there's

487
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,120
nothing better in a farm when your farm

488
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:06,039
laborer doesn't have to mix nutrient

489
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,989
yeah they can be working with the plant

490
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:10,089
rather than working with the nutrients

491
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,579
or working with the feed system they

492
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,709
just head in do a little programming and

493
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:17,589
then they get to go actually observe the

494
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,259
plants all day and if need to be prune

495
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:22,809
if need be transplant that interaction

496
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:24,640
with the plants it's just a refocus of

497
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,440
job yeah and it gives you more time for

498
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,600
scouting if you have any issues in the

499
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,910
space and then maintaining cleanliness

500
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:32,740
at a much higher rate as well which is

501
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,410
one of the most important things of all

502
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:41,609
cultivation is cleanliness especially in

503
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:41,610
nursery yeah so let it slip yeah so easy

504
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:49,420
is it Josh your friend yeah so what's

505
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,100
something you and him like either today

506
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:57,250
or in the past couple days were just

507
00:18:51,099 --> 00:19:00,929
like Dorking out on what kind of mad

508
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:05,950
science are you guys talking we were

509
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:08,769
going in about when you move plants

510
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,930
under different light sources the stress

511
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:12,849
like you know said oak is it better to

512
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:16,150
go from a metal halide to an HP s from

513
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:17,829
veg to flour or LED to HP s and like

514
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,980
what what's an okay transition and

515
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:23,079
what's not and just you know narrating

516
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,480
out about the mechanics of chloroplasts

517
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:28,059
movement and the leaves and just just

518
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,980
trying to understand that a plan is

519
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:32,440
always adapting to its environment at

520
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,940
all times you know when it's when it's

521
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,860
building a leaf it's gonna it's gonna

522
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,019
expand it's gonna expand out it's gonna

523
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:39,849
move chloroplasts around and align them

524
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:42,190
within the leaf structure it's where

525
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:44,919
they're optimally positioned to absorb

526
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,600
light wherever that light source is

527
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,980
coming from or whatever type of light

528
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:49,659
source that is you know we talked about

529
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,880
these pigments today and in the

530
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,560
presentations and those pigments are

531
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,160
selected based on the light source that

532
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,960
the plant is receiving and so when the

533
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,850
light source changes it has to adapt oil

534
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,380
and sometimes it's very difficult for

535
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:04,389
the plant to make drastic out

536
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,210
stations to a different light source so

537
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,830
that's it's just the things you should

538
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,110
be thinking about when you're making

539
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:13,480
these transitions as to why it could be

540
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:15,699
difficult or easier for the plant to

541
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,769
make a transition more quickly

542
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,269
so yeah just you've gotta really pay

543
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:22,029
attention to the fact that the plant is

544
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:24,789
building itself as a receiver of its

545
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:26,799
environment and if you change it it has

546
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:29,470
to change with that and I went further

547
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,909
with it and was saying that temperature

548
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,559
and humidity can have really stressful

549
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,450
effects as well when it's fluctuating

550
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,639
you know at eight to ten percent

551
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,500
humidity in the grow room or you know

552
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,540
going outside of two degrees Celsius

553
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,819
fluctuations like in a small amount of

554
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:46,569
time I think it's fairly stressful to

555
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:47,769
the plants to deal with it to deal with

556
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:49,689
those changes just on their

557
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:51,250
transpiration rates and the amount of

558
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,350
energy they have to spend altering their

559
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,579
stomata maybe I'm wrong I don't really

560
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,319
have any data to back it up it's

561
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:58,149
speculation and research that I want to

562
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,319
see answers to and I don't care if I'm

563
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:05,860
right or not

564
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:08,829
and to him he thinks that it's it takes

565
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:11,849
so long for a plant to respond to a

566
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:14,559
change in temperature in the space that

567
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:16,089
by the time it's by the time it's really

568
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,649
realized that something's changed that

569
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:19,359
it's it's probably gonna have reached

570
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,860
equilibrium again in the space there's

571
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,289
just like these deliberations that go

572
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:24,669
back and forth about the micro mechanics

573
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:26,950
of what's happening in a plant when you

574
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:29,380
get people around each other that both

575
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:34,200
know a lot about it what are some of

576
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:40,900
your favorite cultivars to grow I am

577
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:45,970
fairly why well I prefer plants that are

578
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:48,220
shorter I'm not I love cannabis but I'm

579
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,690
not super well-versed on the genetics

580
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,519
that have been around I have with not

581
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,900
from California I'm not from a state

582
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,289
where it's like been really prevalent I

583
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,160
grew up in Georgia and Tennessee so it's

584
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:58,779
you know I've been learning a lot about

585
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,930
the different cultivars and genetics

586
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:05,410
that are available but I just really

587
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:08,560
like the the vertical racked intensive

588
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,420
growth model with small plants that are

589
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,099
put that don't have a long veg time and

590
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,720
are placed in placed into this

591
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:15,500
production model and can be turned over

592
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,660
a really fast rates

593
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,000
trying to explore what possibilities are

594
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,940
available in that space of doing

595
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,440
extremely closed canopy to canopies that

596
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,730
are really close to the lights that

597
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,830
plants that aren't allowed to grow very

598
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,650
tall so just like trying to see how we

599
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:32,629
can make really small plants that we can

600
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,550
grow at a massive amount of like

601
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,660
individual plants of to create one big

602
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:38,389
canopy in you know the sea of green

603
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,790
model but just shrinking the plants down

604
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,940
more and more and more but I think I get

605
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:45,829
that mentality just from like studying

606
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,720
how to grow plants for space transit

607
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:49,429
when I was in grad school so I'm just

608
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,460
like always and what did you learn about

609
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:57,340
plants in space it's very hard it's very

610
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:59,870
hard to water plants in space yeah it's

611
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:02,659
good you can't else you can't outsmart

612
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:05,149
it I think it's the system they have

613
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,290
right now there's a production module

614
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,730
called veggie there's two of them

615
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:10,069
actually on the space station I think

616
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:12,110
they just launched up the advanced plant

617
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:14,359
habitat which is one that's a lot more

618
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:17,449
versatile but the veggie was the one I

619
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:19,189
was working with and the way the

620
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,860
irrigation system works it's just like

621
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,539
it's a pea it's a piece of foam not all

622
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,579
the one on it's the one on the space

623
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:27,859
station is a little different it's it's

624
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:29,389
just like a reservoir that has a wet

625
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:30,679
surface on it and then you have these

626
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,420
little packets that have a porous

627
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,029
membrane on bottom they sit on this wet

628
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,100
surface they're full of like clay medium

629
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:39,410
with slow release fertilizers in it and

630
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:41,769
it just wicks up water of the out of

631
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,450
that wet surface and because there's no

632
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:46,430
restriction to capillary action where

633
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,200
water will climb something in space it's

634
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,759
only like limited by gravity pulling it

635
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,730
down so water will just climb stuff

636
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:55,420
indefinitely in space so we have this

637
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,920
like genius model of you know letting

638
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,539
the water just wake up so there's no

639
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,330
there's no free water moving at any

640
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:05,210
point it works okay it dries out

641
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:07,939
sometimes some there's also been an

642
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,590
incidents incident of water climbing up

643
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,299
the plant and kind of getting on the

644
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:13,639
leaves and coming out of the root zone

645
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:16,490
so there's that there was that aspect as

646
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,630
well so it's just it's hard and it's

647
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:22,549
well this state the spaces are there

648
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,110
conditions for human comfort and human

649
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:26,928
community and we don't really have

650
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:28,729
really good ways of scrubbing co2 that

651
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:30,019
are really effective I think they're

652
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,519
still just kind of running it through

653
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:34,849
like a sieve bed that they have to

654
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,589
change out so the co2 levels stay really

655
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:38,299
high on the space station that was kind

656
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:39,980
of what I focused my research on because

657
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:42,289
I happen to get a crop that was

658
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,690
extremely sensitive to high co2 levels

659
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:46,369
and had a real drop-off in productivity

660
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:50,900
and when I was reading what Rob was that

661
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:52,609
Chinese cabbage okay real fun like bok

662
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,730
choy type stuff yeah it looks just like

663
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:58,309
bok choy it was um called Tokyo Bay

664
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,339
Connor it's a real leafy soft Chinese

665
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:03,799
cabbage we also did dwarf Tomatoes but

666
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:08,359
they were we were just seeing so many

667
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:09,919
issues with the production system and it

668
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:11,990
was like it was a three month crop to

669
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,610
grow it was like we need to figure out

670
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,859
some of these other issues first because

671
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:18,409
we saw a lot of similar stressors on the

672
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:21,889
tomato crop as we saw in Chinese cabbage

673
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:24,769
which led me to kind of question the

674
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:27,200
entire idea of co2 injection like and

675
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:28,849
whether it was really beneficial which

676
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,120
it definitely increases yield that's

677
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:33,769
definitely been concluded for most crops

678
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,989
but there's also some stressors that it

679
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:39,170
creates some going through a lot of the

680
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,700
literature of like greenhouse tomato co2

681
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,009
enrichment studies you know they

682
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,319
mentioned they're like yeah but our co2

683
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:46,789
plants enriched plants had bunch of

684
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:48,980
lesions on their leaves and they were

685
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:51,049
turning yellow and brown and like there

686
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:55,730
was clear stress from from that being

687
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:57,619
the only different variable so kind of

688
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,569
led me to have a much more conservative

689
00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:02,329
approach to co2 injection I don't think

690
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:04,460
you should go over 800 ppm cannabis grow

691
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:07,129
room I just don't think you're getting

692
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:10,460
much more for injecting any more than

693
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:13,220
800 Jessie what are your thoughts yeah

694
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,440
you know that's it's as far as co2

695
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:19,339
injection I I'm not gonna weigh in on

696
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,039
plants in space that's nowhere so

697
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:23,990
apologize but but you know as far as co2

698
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,730
injection and and I mean even going all

699
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:29,750
the way back to favorite cultivars and

700
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:32,500
plants I I don't I get asked that

701
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,960
question a good amount of time and I

702
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:38,179
think the real answer is all of them you

703
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,840
know there's there is something really

704
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:43,730
awesome about standing next to a

705
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:47,238
20-foot tall cannabis plant you know

706
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:49,489
that has a diameter of 45 or 65 feet

707
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:51,558
like those thing is just so impressive

708
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:54,230
to watch what that plant will do in such

709
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:57,769
a short timeframe if taken care of

710
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:59,929
or conversely being able to grow for

711
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:01,849
efficiency and look at what kind of

712
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:04,009
strains can we put in and at what height

713
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:05,898
and what level and what we can veg and

714
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:07,700
you know we found really cool stuff that

715
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:09,138
was just kind of oddly interesting like

716
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,690
you said about switching environments

717
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:12,888
where okay we're not gonna go cradle to

718
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,409
grave in the same rooms it's not

719
00:27:12,888 --> 00:27:16,548
efficient so we're gonna have to move

720
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:18,799
them and are we gonna build a facility

721
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:20,839
where it's this we can monitor the

722
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,940
environment so closely that we bring

723
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,949
everything to that point and what is the

724
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,090
ROI on that to think that we could gain

725
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:31,129
how much if we're right we gain an extra

726
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:33,769
point zero three percent on the plants

727
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:35,509
yield and so over a 36 year period we're

728
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:36,798
gonna see an ROI on being able to

729
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:39,319
balance our environments through the

730
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:42,470
hallways you have knocking not gonna do

731
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:45,980
that right so being able to look at

732
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,778
figuring out things like we were growing

733
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,489
obviously vertically in the flower rooms

734
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:52,278
and we were growing vertically in veg

735
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:56,239
but if you took in veg our plants had

736
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:58,548
trays and our plants in flour had trays

737
00:27:56,239 --> 00:28:00,169
but they didn't take up the entire rack

738
00:27:58,548 --> 00:28:04,398
system because it moved over what was a

739
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:05,929
graded floor so the light in flour from

740
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,608
all the way up top would still filter

741
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:09,109
through the canopy in small spaces and

742
00:28:07,608 --> 00:28:11,569
wind up getting to the plants on the

743
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:13,548
lower end so if we took our plants that

744
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:15,319
were in veg that were underneath where

745
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:17,690
the white really wasn't filtering from

746
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,579
up high in the same way and we put them

747
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,679
on the bottom where light was now

748
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:23,089
filtering from high in the flower they

749
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,278
would they would be a little more

750
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:26,480
stressed out not terribly but it would

751
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,249
take him a little more time to bounce

752
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,108
back yeah so we started learning that

753
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:32,629
our bottom row veg had to go to our top

754
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:35,569
row in the farm or at least in the

755
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:37,519
flower side and so going back but

756
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:40,220
looking at looking at giant outdoor

757
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,960
plants versus I was always a huge fan of

758
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,169
kind of the old school like super Silver

759
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,940
Haze yeah Hawaiian's snow like I love

760
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:50,179
the structure of those plants I love the

761
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,769
smell of those plants I love the size

762
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:53,100
that they'll get whether it's indoor or

763
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:54,660
out

764
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,399
but always being able to see those new

765
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,259
cultivars have come out where you know

766
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,690
the calyx color changes at a certain

767
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:03,359
time or their pigments change at certain

768
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:06,630
times or they produce very specific

769
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:09,289
terpenes at certain times I just I kind

770
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:12,620
of dork out about all of them yeah so

771
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:15,180
you know but like we were talking about

772
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:18,659
when looking at efficiencies and that's

773
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:21,779
that's where I think I I will sit around

774
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,880
for days and talk about it and try to

775
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:25,559
figure it out because just like when we

776
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,700
were growing in basements and it was

777
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:35,399
like you could see almost like a kinship

778
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:36,960
where you'd be in home depot you're

779
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,880
grabbing this little piece and that and

780
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,490
you're in your brain creating like an

781
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,230
engineering mastermind of how you're

782
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:47,299
going to get this system to work and

783
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:50,279
while you're doing it you'd realize oh

784
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:52,950
you're doing the same thing you - right

785
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:54,809
like oh I know you like you just get

786
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,340
that kind of look and I always wondered

787
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:57,750
if the home depot employees are like the

788
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:00,299
others like six growers over in the

789
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:03,180
plumbing online like I always really

790
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:05,099
appreciated that but you know this

791
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,799
industry right now was built off of

792
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:09,990
people that that for a lot of us that

793
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:12,990
has been our lives and so being able to

794
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,759
graduate that up to where you know it's

795
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,680
just an advancement of whether it's

796
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,970
standing in the home depot plumbing

797
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,090
aisle and bouncing back and forth

798
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:23,250
between that and the irrigation section

799
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:25,319
or it's you sitting with an architect

800
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,299
and a footprint of a building and

801
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:29,039
starting to consider how many foot steps

802
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:30,839
it takes and what the environment will

803
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,149
be for the plant in that transition and

804
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,409
how many square feet and you know even

805
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,120
yesterday I was talking to someone about

806
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:38,700
you know now we're looking at

807
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,739
cylindrical where the lighting isn't you

808
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,360
know which isn't new but we're looking

809
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,220
at vertical stacked where you use

810
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,199
cylindrical lighting and then create a

811
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,059
circle of plants around that are growing

812
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,850
into the light and we were talking about

813
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:52,679
that efficiency and once again there's a

814
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:55,230
problem because you have dead space

815
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,430
between every circle yeah so that's

816
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,589
square footage where I could have a plan

817
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:02,850
squares work better than circles in that

818
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:05,129
scenario yeah and so I just love being

819
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:06,168
able to really sit down and and go

820
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,090
through that because

821
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:10,580
I've had that question before when

822
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:12,589
speaking where people say like well so

823
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:14,418
you got to $189 a pound for indoor

824
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:18,408
cultivation and you said you could get

825
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:20,570
lower how did you do it as if I'm got

826
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:22,970
like some well here let me draw you a

827
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:25,519
picture and here's the answer like it's

828
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:27,889
not it's all those little pieces and I

829
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,138
think it's no different than growing and

830
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:31,608
you're feeding plants right like the

831
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,678
root zone of a plant and the way a plant

832
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:35,089
uptakes nutrient we have somewhat

833
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,679
recently figured out might as well be

834
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:38,898
the bottom of the ocean right we're

835
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,038
still making a lot of theory like we're

836
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:44,988
just realizing in the last decade or two

837
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:45,679
that we don't know as much about plants

838
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:47,269
as we thought we did

839
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,580
sure and then you know people always

840
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:52,669
show you that nutrient availability

841
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:55,099
graph by pH it's like oh well at low pH

842
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:57,320
this nutrient I don't like I love that

843
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:59,118
like that think that's for like outdoor

844
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:02,089
soil I don't know if that really applies

845
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:03,408
to Coco husks right and I remember

846
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:05,628
following that and being like I don't

847
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:09,679
understand I'm in the green zone why is

848
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:11,949
it not taking up the calcium yeah yeah

849
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,778
well maybe there's too much iron or

850
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:17,269
phosphorous area right and then there's

851
00:32:14,778 --> 00:32:19,940
those random times that you know I can

852
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:21,950
remember hey we didn't realize the HVAC

853
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,590
unit went down and the plants spent all

854
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:27,080
day today at 109 degrees like it ramped

855
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:28,939
it up slowly then it didn't kill him but

856
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,829
man I went downstairs and there was you

857
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,288
know water dripping from the fixtures

858
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:35,989
and I was certain that you know bulbs

859
00:32:33,288 --> 00:32:38,989
were gonna explode and oh my god and you

860
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:39,409
wind up with a 40 percent gain in your

861
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:41,480
yield

862
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:44,960
you can never duplicate it and it's like

863
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,489
what was it was it the temperature mixed

864
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,739
with the nutrient was it the humidity

865
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:51,230
was it the stage was it the and there's

866
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:53,028
you know it's like the end it's like the

867
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,919
endless question that growers always

868
00:32:53,028 --> 00:32:56,778
have because we've all hit those crops

869
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:57,669
where we're like yeah I don't know what

870
00:32:56,778 --> 00:33:00,648
I did

871
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:02,119
Kent I can't tell you we had a lucid

872
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:03,258
dream which was one of my favorite

873
00:33:02,118 --> 00:33:05,449
strains to grow because it's really

874
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:07,730
really purple mm-hmm but it would also

875
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,379
produce really well and had a great

876
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,288
flavor and a great smoke and kind of a

877
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:14,269
black licorice smell to it almost

878
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:16,940
barbecue sauce sometimes which was

879
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:18,808
really interesting but uh it was always

880
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:22,048
you know 15 to

881
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:24,089
maybe 19% was its kind of THC range

882
00:33:22,048 --> 00:33:26,999
which is I mean that's kind of right

883
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:31,288
what I would like and I hear that a lot

884
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:33,329
more now right thank God but we grew it

885
00:33:31,288 --> 00:33:35,429
one at one point in time and had a heat

886
00:33:33,329 --> 00:33:37,589
issue in the room or no not a heat issue

887
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:38,820
I'm sorry a light issue not heat because

888
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:40,439
that plant got really sensitive to heat

889
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:42,720
if you overheated it it would grow tiny

890
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,538
little popcorns and then morph out and

891
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,278
do a big problem but we'd had like a

892
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:49,349
nutrient or a light issue where I think

893
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,730
we had the timer's off and I don't

894
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:52,230
remember what the exact problem was but

895
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:56,009
that crop came out and tested it like

896
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:58,409
28% well then we could never duplicate

897
00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:01,349
it again and we were keeping good notes

898
00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:02,999
but you saw an all new genetic potential

899
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:05,459
in this plant that you thought was one

900
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:07,558
thing you know that's we always talk

901
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,240
about cultivars but you know I'm always

902
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:12,628
saying okay let's take your cultivar

903
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:14,638
let's grow it under blue red LEDs let's

904
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:16,108
grow it under broad spectrum LEDs it's

905
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,030
grown under a metal halide it's grown

906
00:34:16,108 --> 00:34:19,378
under an HP s let's grow it outside and

907
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:22,980
then tell me which one's your cultivar

908
00:34:19,378 --> 00:34:28,559
yeah yeah you know we had that fun game

909
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:31,019
with a sfv and I'm gonna butcher this No

910
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,909
yeah we had that sfv and og so we

911
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:34,469
brought you know we had a grower that

912
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:37,769
came in to facility and he's like I got

913
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:39,328
us sfv and it's so it's so dope and then

914
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:41,280
I got us oh gee cush and I'm super

915
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:43,589
stoked and then we put him in the rooms

916
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,440
and started growing him and a little bit

917
00:34:43,588 --> 00:34:47,338
of time went by and I was like aw he's

918
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,898
the same plant

919
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:51,210
it's just ones grown by the ocean and

920
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:54,269
once grown in the valley right isn't sfv

921
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:58,079
San Fernando Valley and og cush is ocean

922
00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:59,159
grown am i like making that up and no no

923
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,930
I think you're right and we kind of

924
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:03,588
research it like maybe we oh no that's

925
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:06,000
that's yeah that's what it is well then

926
00:35:03,588 --> 00:35:08,369
what happens when you put them in the

927
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,619
same indoor environment and I can tell

928
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:13,500
you it takes about a year they become

929
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:15,358
the same plant yeah it was amazing to

930
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,068
watch where you're like you would get

931
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,049
people that were like oh yeah I'll take

932
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:21,059
the smv not the og and you would watch

933
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:23,730
harvest after harvest where they got

934
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:25,529
closer and closer and similarity to

935
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:29,269
where it was like well which one do you

936
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:31,859
want to get rid of yeah yeah it was cool

937
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:33,480
it's very adaptable and we definitely

938
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:35,548
stopped paying attention to that there's

939
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,260
but there's there's so much effect that

940
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:38,909
comes from the grower and from the

941
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,799
cultivation side and from the company

942
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:42,358
actually producing the flower you know

943
00:35:40,798 --> 00:35:43,889
people are very often from the

944
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:46,078
dispensary level like oh we need this

945
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:49,048
strain and we need this strain it's know

946
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,970
you need this grower this brand these

947
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:53,849
people that are producing products for

948
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:56,279
you because that's what's really if

949
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:59,548
that's where the value comes from and I

950
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:03,798
think we'll get there oh yeah it's just

951
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:06,269
a matter of time but you know

952
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:09,269
necessity is what winds up breeding all

953
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:12,389
of that creation and it was an

954
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:14,639
interesting thing I was in talking to

955
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:17,400
some growers here in California about a

956
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,949
year ago a little over a year ago and

957
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,108
they were oh yeah we sell all our flower

958
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:24,149
for 2,800 pound all day long it's gonna

959
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:26,900
be at least three years market strong

960
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:29,220
Rekha's taken off

961
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,630
beautiful because I could tell you from

962
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:33,328
Oregon lessons that things can change

963
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:37,140
fast and now you're looking at the

964
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:40,619
slowdown in regulation epic crops for

965
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:43,980
outdoor season and all the over taxation

966
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:46,559
which is driving people who are sitting

967
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,019
on a maybe license

968
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,519
can't get there CU p and you're looking

969
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:52,798
at taxation that's now starting to weigh

970
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:54,329
in where for example in example in santa

971
00:36:52,798 --> 00:36:57,239
barbara they've now said that you can

972
00:36:54,329 --> 00:37:01,890
grow but you can't dry because it's fire

973
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:04,139
hazard well so who do you think is gonna

974
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:05,848
pay for that that's gonna go right to

975
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:07,679
the consumer so we've got a cultivation

976
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:09,329
tax before we send it to the dryer and

977
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,368
that does a dryer have a tax before he

978
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:12,839
sends it to the processor who has a tax

979
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,608
before they send it to the manufacturer

980
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:15,690
to put it in packaging who then has a

981
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:17,429
tax before they send it to the

982
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,559
distributor to send it out to the

983
00:37:17,429 --> 00:37:21,659
dispensary who has a tax for the

984
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:25,230
consumer and once again now you have a

985
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:27,389
consumer who says you know I've been

986
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,818
buying bags from Jimmy for $40 that are

987
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:32,368
chronic my whole life you know and Jimmy

988
00:37:29,818 --> 00:37:34,739
now separates his strains and I have a

989
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:37,530
total variety and I can still get a bag

990
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:39,059
for $40 or I can run all the way across

991
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,560
town in traffic because we only have

992
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:43,320
eight dispensaries in the whole

993
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,570
and I could pay $85 for a gram grown by

994
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,280
somebody I don't know with no clue what

995
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:50,550
the quality is because I can't see it in

996
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,990
the bag that that and support med men

997
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:58,410
yeah little bit of a problem well you

998
00:37:54,989 --> 00:38:03,299
know at 38 cents a share I'd have been a

999
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:06,449
poor endeavor basically talking drying

1000
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:11,760
curing and then presentation to the end

1001
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:15,869
consumer and so I feel like in a modern

1002
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,780
dispensary that lonely eight sitting on

1003
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:20,880
a shelf by itself as a grower you're

1004
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,490
kind of like it's like the least

1005
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,430
impressive representation of what I'm

1006
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:29,789
capable of and that's what people see

1007
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:33,719
with my brand name on it versus if you

1008
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:36,659
could pull it out of like a big bag full

1009
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:38,489
of all its friends to hand to someone

1010
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:41,250
right before they're about to smoke it

1011
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:46,439
so we're talking right before the camera

1012
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:50,039
was on and so years ago many many moons

1013
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,440
ago we went through a raid at one of our

1014
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:56,239
sister facilities and so the whole panic

1015
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,829
ensues oh my god clean everything out

1016
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,659
you know get rid of this like what

1017
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:01,980
happens if and we were we were running

1018
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:03,960
legal but it was still back in the times

1019
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:08,579
where medical facilities were still

1020
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,500
getting raided and so so we you know

1021
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:13,259
stashed everything we could stash and

1022
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,710
panicked and thankfully it was totally

1023
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,840
fine nothing happened

1024
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:22,170
fast-forward a year later I'm in my

1025
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,730
horse barn I'm like moving stuff around

1026
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:26,309
I get behind a door and I find a big old

1027
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,699
blue bin and I'm like what's this doing

1028
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:28,559
here

1029
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:31,279
thinking it's a big bin a trim and I

1030
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:35,610
pull it out and it's about 10 pounds of

1031
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,260
LA and blackberry and it's all food

1032
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,820
savored it's all been cured and sitting

1033
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,770
in its food saver bags and it's quarter

1034
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,260
pounds which is how I saved it and I was

1035
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:46,769
like holy crap I lost this weed for a

1036
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,510
year dude like so we open it up cut him

1037
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:51,719
open check him out smells incredible

1038
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:53,300
looks incredible had we were at the time

1039
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:55,129
we were testing all the time

1040
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:59,990
Cavani of the whole nine all the

1041
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:02,420
cannabinoids and terpenoids THC it was

1042
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:03,529
incredible and it sold like crazy at the

1043
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,369
dispenser when I brought it out there

1044
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:09,440
but it was kind of that fun game alike

1045
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:13,250
as we've discussed carrying weed is an

1046
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,559
art like it's it it is being able to you

1047
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,000
know once again to dork out and be able

1048
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,070
to get down to like the exact

1049
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,869
temperature and the exact humidity

1050
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:23,150
fluctuations and the water activity and

1051
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:25,309
the moisture content for each strain I

1052
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,590
think that you can really really get far

1053
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:29,719
into that into understanding exactly how

1054
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,550
to cure your cannabis perfectly so that

1055
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,119
actually gets better over time if stored

1056
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:35,330
properly

1057
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:38,389
sure yeah there there is some mechanics

1058
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:40,279
to pay attention to this isn't the only

1059
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:42,049
product that needs to be dried and cured

1060
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,390
you know they do it with tobacco beef

1061
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,620
jerky and dried fruits and I mean

1062
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:47,170
there's there's water activity

1063
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:49,789
establishments for those and

1064
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:51,619
particularly on the tobacco route and

1065
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:53,329
even certain types of tea leaves that

1066
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:55,279
are processed for a long periods of time

1067
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:57,440
like you know they're paying attention

1068
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,140
to enzymatic activity going on within

1069
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,059
the tissue as its as its losing water

1070
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:03,949
and there's a threshold where enzymatic

1071
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:06,949
activity cuts off there's a threshold

1072
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:08,659
also where mold growth cuts off and

1073
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:11,149
there's a there's a window between there

1074
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:13,069
where you could really slow down the

1075
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:15,680
drying process and let the plant

1076
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:17,480
continue to break itself down and remove

1077
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,190
some of these like harsher chemicals and

1078
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,719
if the just chlorophylls are not that

1079
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:23,300
great to smoke they just are kind of

1080
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,829
minty and but those will break down with

1081
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,390
time and try and really trying to

1082
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:28,579
identify those windows where you can

1083
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:30,319
extend out the curing process or even

1084
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:31,909
the drying process for a longer period

1085
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,830
of time once you've cleared a window

1086
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:36,949
where you're gonna where you might cause

1087
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:38,539
harm to the crop so yeah there's a lot

1088
00:41:36,949 --> 00:41:41,750
and there's lots of details there that

1089
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:43,460
we really need yeah there's it that once

1090
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,289
again like add it to the list of

1091
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,519
projects yeah you know and it's a fun

1092
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:48,619
thing to think of to like we're talking

1093
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:52,309
about with the the lonely 8th on the

1094
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:55,489
shelf versus versus the joint and you

1095
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:58,309
know like it's my own little personal

1096
00:41:55,489 --> 00:42:02,569
thing in the world but the joint is this

1097
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:06,009
little enigma in the space that it kind

1098
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:08,710
of drives me crazy because it's so

1099
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:12,000
diverse and people don't the consumers

1100
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:15,280
don't realize it like we're going to

1101
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,159
very specifically grind up this part of

1102
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,410
the plant in this fashion and do an ad

1103
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:23,230
back of it the kief that came from that

1104
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:26,379
plant in order to fashion this joint in

1105
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,240
a way that is mixed down on on sieve

1106
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,490
tables so that we have the right

1107
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,889
particulate to burn and we're gonna do

1108
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:35,469
it at scale and it's gonna be great and

1109
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:37,269
meanwhile this person showed up at my

1110
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,759
facility and they bought everything that

1111
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:41,650
we weren't even gonna send to extract

1112
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,540
that we were saving up because

1113
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:45,610
eventually maybe we'll we'll burn it

1114
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:46,929
down to distillate at some very small

1115
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,300
amount and see if it's even worth it

1116
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:52,690
because it's the stocks and the stems

1117
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:55,510
and sugar leaf and leaf and you know

1118
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:57,730
cannabis that was on the floor and they

1119
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:59,620
pick it up and then put it through the

1120
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:03,760
world's largest grinder and stuff it in

1121
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:06,039
a joint and sell it for a the same or

1122
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,930
less price and the consumer doesn't know

1123
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:10,210
this there's nothing on the package that

1124
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:12,159
lets you know that's what's going on no

1125
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,990
there's a bunch of trim leaves in your

1126
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,670
joint yeah that's all you're smoking

1127
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:17,619
that's usually not really communicated

1128
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:19,869
on the packaging and so the joint thing

1129
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:22,230
is the joint world is really interesting

1130
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:25,630
to me and in whoever figures out how to

1131
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:29,710
crack that nut in reaching the consumer

1132
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:32,260
and understanding what's what that joint

1133
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:34,199
consists of and I don't know that it

1134
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,400
ever happens right like I mean

1135
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:37,949
cigarettes are still smoked in America

1136
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,300
and the consumer knows what's in them

1137
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,809
and so I don't know that that ever

1138
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,940
happens

1139
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:44,949
maybe there's always a specific price

1140
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,869
point and if you want to get up and

1141
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:48,429
above then you're looking at Kanna gars

1142
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:52,269
you're looking at things that are at

1143
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:54,159
that level but that it's one of the

1144
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:56,860
idiosyncrasies in the industry at least

1145
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:58,750
on the consumer side of things that I'm

1146
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,460
really intrigued by because maybe we

1147
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,949
grew a product that won't look great in

1148
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:05,769
that lonely 8th on the shelf or when

1149
00:44:02,949 --> 00:44:07,809
it's getting down to the end we we

1150
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:10,179
always like to grind those into into

1151
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:12,639
joints and now great it's a pretty joint

1152
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:16,739
it looks good it's good cannabis and

1153
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:19,389
it's now competing with everything else

1154
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,969
that nobody can identify yeah

1155
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:24,578
you're just looking at labels yeah I I I

1156
00:44:21,969 --> 00:44:26,889
honestly prefer the model of all the big

1157
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:28,839
jars I'm like behind behind the register

1158
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:32,828
and let you get to actually like smell

1159
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:34,808
all of the all the bud together and it

1160
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:36,789
tends to hold a lot better smell that

1161
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:39,369
way is I don't think people have really

1162
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:42,579
dialed in airtight packaging as well as

1163
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:44,680
they think they have because use most

1164
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:47,230
the jars I've ever come into possession

1165
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,940
of where that came from retail store

1166
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,789
that were you know cellophane wrapped

1167
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:53,289
we're really dry when I opened them and

1168
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:55,930
they weren't even that old you know

1169
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:57,609
that's I think there's still a lot of

1170
00:44:55,929 --> 00:45:02,980
work to do to actually make that jar

1171
00:44:57,608 --> 00:45:05,048
worth it as well yeah I can remember we

1172
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,028
would use the big jars that we could put

1173
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:09,369
a half pound in in any order them

1174
00:45:07,028 --> 00:45:12,429
they've got the great screw on lids this

1175
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:13,930
is how we're gonna store cannabis we

1176
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:16,118
first got into it we put it in the vault

1177
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:19,118
when we first started the vault wasn't

1178
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:21,010
temperature regulated and so one of our

1179
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,539
strains I get in and see it and when I

1180
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:26,410
take the lid off you can see what looks

1181
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:29,170
like glue from the kind of padding

1182
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:30,578
inside the lid and seal it is on the lid

1183
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,950
and it started running down the side

1184
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:35,798
there you are and we're like oh my god

1185
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:37,838
how much of this if we destroyed as we

1186
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:40,480
go through this panic phase a little bit

1187
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,338
of like we have to get everything out of

1188
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,170
these jars if it's glue and then you

1189
00:45:42,338 --> 00:45:45,759
start looking you realize wait a minute

1190
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:49,329
look at these other lids there's no glue

1191
00:45:45,759 --> 00:45:50,769
on here where is this coming from and

1192
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,869
that's when I got to learn the lesson

1193
00:45:50,768 --> 00:45:54,278
that terpenes don't taste as good as you

1194
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:57,130
would think when you put them on your

1195
00:45:54,278 --> 00:46:01,239
tongue so take that lid and I'm like

1196
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:05,858
what is that glue is it Oh God made a

1197
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:08,048
mercy no and so it was skunk oil yeah

1198
00:46:05,858 --> 00:46:09,848
really cool to see that the right

1199
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:11,619
packaging with like that we were

1200
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:13,240
actually getting terpenes to wick out of

1201
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:14,500
the product and on the jar was kind of

1202
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:16,139
its own cool unique thing but it was

1203
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,250
once again another lesson like oh

1204
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:20,558
perhaps there's happening there yeah I

1205
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:23,048
mean perhaps there's a better way for it

1206
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,579
to be stored at the on site to where

1207
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:26,199
it's not that's not a happening that

1208
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:28,150
it's not experiencing temperatures that

1209
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:30,460
would result in volatility of those

1210
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:32,559
terpenes you know I always see these

1211
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,250
charts that say this is the combustion

1212
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:35,440
temperature

1213
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,639
for this terpene and you know people

1214
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,860
really follow that but I'm like but

1215
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,569
what's the like low threshold of

1216
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,340
volatility of that terpene when it

1217
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,690
starts off gassing you know that's

1218
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,780
something I haven't really seen a lot of

1219
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:49,630
data for combustion temperature is one

1220
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:51,280
thing but you know I it seems like it

1221
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,990
would be nice if you were if you're

1222
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,820
providing a brand to a dispensary that

1223
00:46:52,989 --> 00:46:56,889
perhaps you can decide how your product

1224
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,590
is stored at that site and you can you

1225
00:46:56,889 --> 00:47:02,019
know you know even in like convenience

1226
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:03,550
stores you know like a soda company will

1227
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:05,139
have their own cooler that they keep

1228
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,940
their products and because it's how they

1229
00:47:05,139 --> 00:47:08,769
want it to be presented you know I think

1230
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,900
that model could be interesting as well

1231
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:13,179
just mostly just for how the products

1232
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,619
actually kept right but like we're

1233
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:16,329
talking about earlier now you start

1234
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:19,210
getting into that like okay I'm building

1235
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:21,789
a cultivation facility trim dry cure

1236
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:23,639
storage my vault okay my volt needs a

1237
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:26,889
temperature store but wait

1238
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:30,159
okay beta Mersin starts to be volatile

1239
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:32,079
at this temperature but pining is

1240
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,429
volatile at this temperature and I don't

1241
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,110
want to store them both in the same volt

1242
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:36,699
so how many volts how much space do I

1243
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:39,250
need for storage and then where do I

1244
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:41,039
draw that line and and then once again

1245
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,570
looking at that enzymatic breakdown

1246
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:45,190
process compared to the water activity

1247
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,780
which ceases mold production and where

1248
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:49,119
that window is and how I can affect my

1249
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,650
care rooms and like we were talking

1250
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,989
about like you start getting into all of

1251
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:55,300
this and figuring out how to design a

1252
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:57,729
facility that either can do this at the

1253
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,320
time which is really expensive or can be

1254
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:03,610
scaled into it without interrupting

1255
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:09,220
operations it's it's intimidating yeah

1256
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:12,190
it is but it's also in my tiny man brain

1257
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:14,889
crazy fun that's the fun part if you

1258
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:17,230
have the capital to do it that that it's

1259
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:20,079
these are the coolest projects

1260
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:21,909
especially at this time in the world in

1261
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,769
the industry and the society that we

1262
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:27,279
live in like these are really cutting

1263
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:29,400
edge topics it's I just want to see more

1264
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,750
of it I want to participate in it and

1265
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,550
yeah it's really exciting yeah it's

1266
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:36,400
gonna happen one way or another it's

1267
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:38,470
just you know there's going to be

1268
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,800
someone out there screaming at their

1269
00:48:38,469 --> 00:48:44,199
television when they see that you know

1270
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,750
Monsanto or Bayer or someone of this

1271
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:48,219
nature has solved the riddle of curing

1272
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:50,980
blah blah blah and they're like I've

1273
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:54,309
been doing that for the last years and

1274
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:56,320
no one I can you know yeah I can see all

1275
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:58,449
of the hard work in some aspects

1276
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,430
potentially being stolen away from those

1277
00:48:58,449 --> 00:49:03,279
who were kind of the creators of it by

1278
00:49:00,429 --> 00:49:04,719
those who have that clout but and once

1279
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,040
again and I think we've talked about

1280
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,169
this before or at least I've talked

1281
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:09,969
about it before but that's where the

1282
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,349
fight is right like you don't just roll

1283
00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:13,089
over and say well one day big

1284
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:14,920
corporations and big cannabis are gonna

1285
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,059
tear all this apart and none of us are

1286
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,150
gonna be left and it's all gonna be

1287
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:21,219
horrible go be the big corporation no

1288
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:23,500
become that person and then just behave

1289
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:26,409
accordingly yeah exactly it's possible

1290
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:29,230
yeah that's that's this all can come

1291
00:49:26,409 --> 00:49:31,449
from there so just quickly can you talk

1292
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:34,929
about your approach to drying and curing

1293
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:37,119
like what what what humidity and

1294
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:40,569
temperatures are you in in the drive

1295
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:43,029
phase and for how long and then like how

1296
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:45,610
do you approach curing yeah I mean well

1297
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:48,610
so I will preface this by saying I

1298
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:51,579
believe the drying and curing that is an

1299
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:53,230
art that I would say is definitely my

1300
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:55,329
weakest and it's only because it's so

1301
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:57,070
meticulous and I didn't get the chance

1302
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:59,349
when I was at that level of cultivation

1303
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:00,400
to have access to the tools and the

1304
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:02,049
knowledge to be able to start

1305
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,889
understanding those breakdown processes

1306
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:07,360
really appropriately so like most of us

1307
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:11,230
depending on the strain I like to live

1308
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:14,170
in that you know 55 to 65 percent

1309
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:17,170
humidity range that slowly eats down or

1310
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:19,269
up but at the smallest increments

1311
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:21,730
possible is to not make drastic changes

1312
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:25,329
and to live right around that 60 degree

1313
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:27,880
mark 60 to 65 depending on the strain

1314
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:30,009
and the density and once again I would

1315
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,289
say the biggest thing that at least it's

1316
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:34,780
been my experience is when you

1317
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:35,920
accidentally over dry and so oh my god

1318
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,630
let's throw a bunch of water on the

1319
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,579
floor because this is all gonna turn to

1320
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:41,829
dust when we trim it those huge

1321
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:43,569
fluctuations in temperature and those

1322
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:45,340
huge fluctuations in humidity

1323
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:47,410
those are what cost you your terpenes

1324
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:49,360
yeah those are what wind up where you're

1325
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:53,409
like great I saved the crop and it has

1326
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:57,190
no smell whatsoever you know so in

1327
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:59,980
saying that you know curing and drying

1328
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,800
is definitely an art form and it's it's

1329
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,960
something

1330
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,190
the biggest lesson I think we learned at

1331
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,539
eco was as we built the facility out

1332
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:10,880
budgetary wise the last thing we

1333
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:12,099
addressed was trim dry cure we didn't

1334
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,119
have the money to build it in

1335
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:18,080
equivalency to how we built our flower

1336
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:22,099
rooms and it was it cost us 100 percent

1337
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:25,519
was a it was a mistake and I wouldn't

1338
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:26,900
say was a mistake in the sense of oh we

1339
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:29,150
should have put more money here we just

1340
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,280
didn't have capital but we just didn't

1341
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:33,710
and then we got investors and we got a

1342
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,140
sale and everything was gonna be perfect

1343
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:38,240
and and of course it wasn't but you know

1344
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:41,500
if you're out there cultivating and

1345
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:43,909
you're looking at building a facility

1346
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,219
that's definitely not where you need to

1347
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:48,139
not sync money but that being said well

1348
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:48,529
okay if I'm gonna have a shortfall what

1349
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:51,259
do I do

1350
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:54,530
I don't have an answer for you like you

1351
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:58,339
just can't have a shortfall yeah I think

1352
00:51:54,530 --> 00:52:00,080
an industry-standard ideal is 60 60

1353
00:51:58,338 --> 00:52:02,570
that's what most people are shooting for

1354
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,949
I'm saying I'm around that range I

1355
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:06,140
always try to drive the temperature down

1356
00:52:03,949 --> 00:52:07,429
as much as possible without preventing

1357
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:08,900
it from drying I mean you get more

1358
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:11,000
terpene preservation and colder

1359
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,530
temperatures you're less likely to

1360
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,170
overdraw it's just making sure that you

1361
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,700
don't get it so cold like down below 50

1362
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:18,019
degrees where it's just pretty much not

1363
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:19,759
gonna dry at all

1364
00:52:18,019 --> 00:52:22,449
and then if you do want to run at those

1365
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,730
temperatures your HVAC costs spikes

1366
00:52:22,449 --> 00:52:27,469
intensely to actually be able to to pull

1367
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:29,869
moisture out at that temperature is

1368
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:33,289
really difficult because most of our

1369
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:35,510
besides you know drying liquid desiccant

1370
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:39,369
systems which are crazy expensive and

1371
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:42,710
not really user-friendly for most people

1372
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:45,140
we really rely on just condensation of

1373
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,400
these like cold refrigerants to pull

1374
00:52:45,139 --> 00:52:48,650
moisture out of the air and they have

1375
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,660
their limitations there's some

1376
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:53,720
mechanisms that are you know like anti

1377
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:57,710
freeze mechanisms and the compressor and

1378
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:58,730
the compressors too I'm not sure but

1379
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,530
they have these like anti freeze

1380
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:03,679
mechanisms to prevent the machine from

1381
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:05,180
locking up and you know that's an

1382
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:06,889
adaptation but it's still just like

1383
00:53:05,179 --> 00:53:08,690
trying to create all these like muscles

1384
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:11,088
around the basic concept of just a

1385
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:12,470
compressor that's moving refrigerant

1386
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:15,079
through some coils and so there's just

1387
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:17,929
limitations to what we can actually do

1388
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:20,150
I think that it's I think something that

1389
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:22,759
people are opening their mind up to is

1390
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:24,889
drying and curing kind of on the line

1391
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,380
like and together trying to create a

1392
00:53:24,889 --> 00:53:29,449
room that can also be the that can

1393
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:31,099
create some sort of curing process as

1394
00:53:29,449 --> 00:53:33,169
well or you you can alter your

1395
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:37,039
conditions inside that space to prolong

1396
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:38,780
the breakdown of the crop which could be

1397
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:40,489
done by you know dropping the

1398
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:42,110
temperature letting the humidity come up

1399
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:44,359
just a little bit once the products like

1400
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:46,670
you know at a safe level for them for

1401
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:50,210
microbial content after water activity

1402
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:51,530
level measurement and and yeah just

1403
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:53,300
trying to kind of like put those two

1404
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:55,100
processes together to where you can get

1405
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,350
a pretty decent product it's ready to go

1406
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:58,759
into a package without having to have

1407
00:53:57,349 --> 00:54:05,960
these separate compartments in your

1408
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:08,180
facility and also a important you know

1409
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,530
it's all linked pre-harvest treatment of

1410
00:54:08,179 --> 00:54:12,169
your plant has a lot to do with your

1411
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:14,090
drawing care out results you know how

1412
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:15,710
much it was water how much nutrients it

1413
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:18,170
was given towards the end of its life if

1414
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,880
it was like just dumped full of nitrogen

1415
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:22,670
until it's the last few days of its

1416
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:25,130
lifecycle that's gonna be a long cure if

1417
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:27,470
it does it's it's gonna take a long time

1418
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:29,690
to break all that down all the nitrate

1419
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:31,549
levels in the chlorophyll spike that

1420
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:33,380
occurs from feeding a ton of nitrate to

1421
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:35,869
a plant sometimes they just start

1422
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:39,680
putting on new flowers and it you get

1423
00:54:35,869 --> 00:54:41,030
these slick little worms fingering what

1424
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:41,989
people have tons of different words for

1425
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:43,640
calling it where that's just these

1426
00:54:41,989 --> 00:54:45,229
little shoots coming off the flowers

1427
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:45,858
late cycle that looks like it's starting

1428
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:48,949
all over

1429
00:54:45,858 --> 00:54:51,108
and it's mostly from nutrients there's

1430
00:54:48,949 --> 00:54:52,819
other stressors that'll do it but you

1431
00:54:51,108 --> 00:54:54,349
know so knowing knowing what to pull out

1432
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:56,030
of your root system and how to kind of

1433
00:54:54,349 --> 00:54:58,489
like starve out your plant a little bit

1434
00:54:56,030 --> 00:55:00,800
towards the end but then again that's

1435
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:02,269
really just talking about smokeable

1436
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,519
flower products is that really necessary

1437
00:55:02,269 --> 00:55:07,460
when you're when you're just doing it

1438
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:10,759
for extracts you know what questions we

1439
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:13,789
need answers to yeah it's a good point

1440
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,950
and once again it's it's just another

1441
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:20,059
one of the list of projects yeah you

1442
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:22,069
know like and that that's where that

1443
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:23,539
whole and not only is a list of projects

1444
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:26,690
but that's where that whole consumer

1445
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:28,068
education comes in again too so from

1446
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:30,559
consumer being the disc

1447
00:55:28,068 --> 00:55:33,199
sorry too consumer being the consumer

1448
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,119
but when you do do that research and we

1449
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:36,349
have gotten there and okay we've put in

1450
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,630
the time and the money we've created

1451
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:40,778
facility and we've done the research and

1452
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:43,309
we know how to cure each strain

1453
00:55:40,778 --> 00:55:45,978
perfectly for its terpene preservation

1454
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:48,589
and we can keep it on-site and cured in

1455
00:55:45,978 --> 00:55:50,058
this environment for a year and then

1456
00:55:48,588 --> 00:55:54,679
we're gonna start selling it like fine

1457
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:56,719
wine to who because we haven't nobody's

1458
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:59,629
really figured out yet that to come in

1459
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:06,829
and find a perfectly cured super Silver

1460
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:08,420
Haze that is vintage 2017 and it's two

1461
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:11,959
hundred and eighty six dollars a gram

1462
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:14,778
because it's like so perfect that that

1463
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:17,899
market doesn't exist yet yeah at least

1464
00:56:14,778 --> 00:56:19,818
not at a large enough scale so you get

1465
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,289
to solve both riddles yeah it's it's

1466
00:56:19,818 --> 00:56:25,458
definitely a small community that's

1467
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:26,119
after that market right now but it will

1468
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:29,929
come around

1469
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:34,068
yeah it's on its way just a matter of

1470
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:35,509
time so what consumers value versus what

1471
00:56:34,068 --> 00:56:38,449
you would like them to value I feel like

1472
00:56:35,509 --> 00:56:42,079
people you know bag appeal and numbers

1473
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:46,579
is kind of what drives what people pick

1474
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:49,190
in the shops yeah I mean so for one I'd

1475
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:52,910
like to say of what what consumers value

1476
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:55,338
I want consumers to value what makes

1477
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:57,139
them happy right if what makes you happy

1478
00:56:55,338 --> 00:57:00,828
as a consumer is to get in and your

1479
00:56:57,139 --> 00:57:02,868
experience takes you you know 27 seconds

1480
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:05,298
out of your day I just want to grab that

1481
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:06,949
package oints and go I don't care to

1482
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:08,809
know all of this stuff about it it's

1483
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:11,539
just I just want that package oints oh

1484
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:13,099
that's that is great like I want you to

1485
00:57:11,539 --> 00:57:16,670
just have the experience you want to be

1486
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:21,380
happy with what exists out there so that

1487
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:24,289
being said it you know I think that it's

1488
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:25,548
our duty as an industry as a whole to

1489
00:57:24,289 --> 00:57:28,519
just make sure all the information is

1490
00:57:25,548 --> 00:57:31,248
there you know if a consumer comes into

1491
00:57:28,518 --> 00:57:32,448
a dispenser who's looking for you know a

1492
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:34,129
wedding gift

1493
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,588
that is very unique and they want to

1494
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:39,798
understand like is there something like

1495
00:57:36,588 --> 00:57:41,838
a three-year-old cured cannabis does it

1496
00:57:39,798 --> 00:57:43,818
matter like

1497
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:46,038
we are reaching that phase finally where

1498
00:57:43,818 --> 00:57:49,190
I just want whatever's got the most THC

1499
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:50,599
that doesn't it's not quite as popular

1500
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:52,219
anymore in some of the more advanced

1501
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:54,200
markets we are starting to see people

1502
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:55,608
who that's not what they're shopping for

1503
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:57,498
you don't go to the liquor store just to

1504
00:57:55,608 --> 00:58:02,210
buy grain alcohol over and over and over

1505
00:57:57,498 --> 00:58:04,548
again but that being said what are we

1506
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:07,009
addressing what is the consumer saying

1507
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:10,088
and what the highest THD number well why

1508
00:58:07,009 --> 00:58:12,858
because I want to be as high as possible

1509
00:58:10,088 --> 00:58:14,449
well what is as high as possible like

1510
00:58:12,858 --> 00:58:17,960
what do you call as high as possible I

1511
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:20,478
want to be so high that I can't get off

1512
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,639
my couch for an hour versus I want to be

1513
00:58:20,478 --> 00:58:25,159
so high that I spent an hour looking for

1514
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:28,848
my sunglasses that were on my face those

1515
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:31,038
are very very different strains and they

1516
00:58:28,849 --> 00:58:34,789
have very little to do with the THC

1517
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:37,430
content necessarily so I think that it's

1518
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:39,499
incumbent upon us to start to get that

1519
00:58:37,429 --> 00:58:41,568
information out there because right now

1520
00:58:39,498 --> 00:58:43,608
the industry so new a lot of consumers

1521
00:58:41,568 --> 00:58:45,018
don't know that that exists and so they

1522
00:58:43,608 --> 00:58:46,998
can't want it because they just don't

1523
00:58:45,018 --> 00:58:49,788
realize it's there sure and you can't

1524
00:58:46,998 --> 00:58:51,709
reliably with it without having a really

1525
00:58:49,789 --> 00:58:53,749
good company providing the product you

1526
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:55,219
can't reliably find that same experience

1527
00:58:53,748 --> 00:58:56,899
every time you go to the store it's

1528
00:58:55,219 --> 00:58:58,369
always a different harvest it's always a

1529
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,289
different batch it's always a different

1530
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:01,969
brand being carried you know to actually

1531
00:59:00,289 --> 00:59:03,799
be able to trace what it is that you're

1532
00:59:01,969 --> 00:59:04,999
after is difficult you know so it's like

1533
00:59:03,798 --> 00:59:06,889
every time you go in there you've only

1534
00:59:04,998 --> 00:59:09,409
got so many metrics to go off of and

1535
00:59:06,889 --> 00:59:10,940
often high THC content is something that

1536
00:59:09,409 --> 00:59:12,588
people would use is like well they do

1537
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,539
something they were what they were doing

1538
00:59:12,588 --> 00:59:17,778
while they grew it I mean it came out at

1539
00:59:14,539 --> 00:59:18,890
12% he brought leads like there's a good

1540
00:59:17,778 --> 00:59:20,119
chance that you messed something up

1541
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:22,389
there's not a lot of people trying to

1542
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:26,150
grow a strain that's supposed to be 12%

1543
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:27,139
so it is it's just not what they

1544
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:31,190
wouldn't think that that would be

1545
00:59:27,139 --> 00:59:33,170
marketable to people but every week and

1546
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:34,309
month that goes by I hear more people

1547
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,528
telling me yeah I really like finding

1548
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:38,210
more balance strains than that just kind

1549
00:59:36,528 --> 00:59:40,639
of work with my physiology a lot better

1550
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:42,710
and make me feel relaxed and you know

1551
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,328
and a lot of people just have been

1552
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:46,849
feeling anxiety from different strains

1553
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:48,619
and I wonder why that is and so I would

1554
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:50,900
just I would want people to just be much

1555
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:52,400
more aware of what go what's in the

1556
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,630
product that they're buying and paying

1557
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,260
more attention to where it's coming from

1558
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:57,750
and being concerned about

1559
00:59:55,260 --> 01:00:00,360
and and voicing their opinion about that

1560
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:01,889
to people they're buying it from and you

1561
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,870
know making that be more known so that

1562
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:05,150
they can actually rely on an experience

1563
01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:07,619
that they're looking for

1564
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:09,960
yeah and it's it's an interesting thing

1565
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:12,920
too because you think of it culturally

1566
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,059
and it has been my experience that

1567
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:18,599
typically if you're looking at a strain

1568
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:21,269
that's you know in the mid to upper 20

1569
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:23,730
percentile of THC and it's really high

1570
01:00:21,269 --> 01:00:26,759
in beta Mersin and maybe even a little

1571
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:31,349
high in CBN if you're prone to paranoia

1572
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:33,180
or anxiety those tend to do that I've

1573
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:33,599
seen that do that to people who are that

1574
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:37,049
way

1575
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,549
it's a lot substantially less often that

1576
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:41,910
I hear somebody tell me about a strain

1577
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:44,970
that is you know 22% and smelled like

1578
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:47,369
like limes that also gave them anxiety

1579
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:50,069
and so I do believe there's a link there

1580
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:52,309
in that beta Mersin but that being said

1581
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:55,970
it's kind of like I look at it like

1582
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:58,079
tequila like when you say tequila

1583
01:00:55,969 --> 01:01:00,480
culturally here in the United States

1584
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,429
people go to one place in their head

1585
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,309
which is why I can't drink tequila

1586
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:08,759
it makes me mean or yeah I love tequila

1587
01:01:05,309 --> 01:01:10,500
it's great but there is tequila the word

1588
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:16,020
tequila and the thought of tequila has

1589
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:18,090
it has like a urban culture amongst the

1590
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:19,769
drinking crowd where did that come from

1591
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:21,329
there isn't I'm not aware of a

1592
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:23,579
scientific study that I read at some

1593
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:25,349
point in time that said tequila accesses

1594
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:28,289
your amygdala in a certain way or your

1595
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:31,889
limbic system it's so why does tequila

1596
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:36,090
make people mean is is it just over time

1597
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:37,769
eventually it's culturally accepted

1598
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:39,150
because it happens so much over time

1599
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:41,730
when we get to a place where people go

1600
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:46,619
oh yeah baby mercy no I don't smoke that

1601
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:48,449
yeah I don't know I don't know how that

1602
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:52,319
information gets out I don't know how

1603
01:01:48,449 --> 01:01:56,069
that's cycles around I can tell you from

1604
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:57,780
my life as a firefighter when we go when

1605
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:59,010
we have gone when I have gone on calls

1606
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,780
in the past with people who have

1607
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:05,880
consumed too much cannabis through

1608
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:09,420
smoking and they're freaking out

1609
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:11,430
I will typically once once week

1610
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,539
have a conversation which just the fact

1611
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:14,039
that you have an emergency worker

1612
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:16,199
present somebody wearing a badge that

1613
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:19,920
has some sympathy tends to calm people

1614
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:24,149
down a little bit until the police show

1615
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:27,230
up sorry guys but no I'm just kidding

1616
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:29,880
but it tends to be when you talk to them

1617
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:31,349
I'll have a discussion about beta mercy

1618
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,510
and the strains that they were smoking

1619
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:34,710
and it always turns out the same well I

1620
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:36,990
you know I like to get really high THC

1621
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:39,420
and well you know I was smoking gorilla

1622
01:02:36,989 --> 01:02:40,798
glue I was smoking and not bad-mouthing

1623
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,900
any of these strengths or great strains

1624
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:45,539
and just for them they always tend to

1625
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:47,130
point to high beta Mersin strains and

1626
01:02:45,539 --> 01:02:48,900
every one of them that I've said hey

1627
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,480
let's steer away from that maybe steer

1628
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:53,519
yourself towards these type of strains

1629
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:56,280
I've never seen that patient again and

1630
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:59,429
maybe that's coincidental or maybe not

1631
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:01,349
but there's something to be said I think

1632
01:02:59,429 --> 01:03:02,909
for the way and that's not for everybody

1633
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:05,599
once again like some people I'm sure

1634
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:07,769
experienced high anxiety from CBD or

1635
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,539
anything random it's all on your own

1636
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:11,818
body chemistry but I do think that there

1637
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:15,409
are some as we're starting to get

1638
01:03:11,818 --> 01:03:19,230
through this I think that there are some

1639
01:03:15,409 --> 01:03:21,868
norms out there as a whole that are

1640
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:24,269
starting to kind of pop up yeah so I

1641
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:26,849
guess just like people to realize that

1642
01:03:24,269 --> 01:03:28,739
there's a tremendous diversity of how

1643
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:31,740
cannabis can make you feel depending on

1644
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:33,298
the strain that's the chemo type and how

1645
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:35,639
it was cultivated how it was dried and

1646
01:03:33,298 --> 01:03:38,039
processed and the overall quality of the

1647
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:39,449
production process all plays into the

1648
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:41,400
end outcome of how it's going to affect

1649
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:43,259
you and it'd be nice for them to pay

1650
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,750
more attention to that be looking for

1651
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:48,089
that be asking for that and also be able

1652
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:51,239
to rely on that being you know

1653
01:03:48,088 --> 01:03:53,068
consistent yeah yeah and that's a

1654
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:54,509
responsibility on all of us right we

1655
01:03:53,068 --> 01:03:57,539
have to create that we have to create

1656
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:59,220
the space where when you go buy a Grey

1657
01:03:57,539 --> 01:04:01,380
Goose vodka you know what you're getting

1658
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:03,959
every time Grey Goose exists and and

1659
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:06,450
it's sitting next to kettle one it's

1660
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,329
sitting next to these top shelfs of

1661
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:11,129
vodkas and as we all know that it sits

1662
01:04:09,329 --> 01:04:14,250
in that place it sits at that level and

1663
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:16,440
when you're looking at the HRD and that

1664
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:18,719
Night Train like they all said it's with

1665
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,818
people need that yeah there's no problem

1666
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:22,079
with that the same company could produce

1667
01:04:20,818 --> 01:04:23,340
both

1668
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,349
but it's incumbent upon us as an

1669
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:27,809
industry to start creating those lines

1670
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:30,059
for the consumer yeah it'd be really

1671
01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:33,329
nice for us to get some some hard

1672
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:35,880
categories to start putting strains into

1673
01:04:33,329 --> 01:04:39,539
it that is gonna be quite the argument

1674
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:44,910
oh yes we still can't get over indica

1675
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:47,880
sativa so chemo types perhaps maybe

1676
01:04:44,909 --> 01:04:51,170
maybe but once again that's a it's a

1677
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,170
long path of Education
