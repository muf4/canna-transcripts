1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,888
[Music]

2
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:15,178
so yeah we're going to be transitioning

3
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:21,890
now into the IP intellectual property

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:24,509
section of the discussion IP is a very

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,420
misunderstood issue in cannabis there's

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,368
it's in flux it's very complicated in

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,609
the United States when it comes to

8
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:35,909
patents and plants and the United States

9
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:39,929
system is very unique in this regard but

10
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:42,000
one thing is that patents are kind of

11
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:43,890
the the elephant in the room and

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,170
everybody's worried about patents

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,640
there's a lot of discussion online about

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,590
patents biotech industries LLC has

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,109
applied for and received several

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,870
cannabis related patents some utility

17
00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:01,170
patents as well as cultivar patents that

18
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:03,839
fall under the same category as their

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,090
utility patents so this is something

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,760
that's not very well understood there's

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,490
a lot of confusion about it and there's

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,500
also a lot of facets that we're not

23
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:16,649
necessarily looking at or discussing

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,659
online things like trademarks Appalachia

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,180
as there are lots of different ways of

26
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,880
protecting IP and we're lucky enough to

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,130
have Sheila here with us she's a patent

28
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:30,810
attorney she has experience in this

29
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:32,670
field and so yeah I'm gonna kick it over

30
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,490
to Sheila to give us a little bit of

31
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,118
background on the patent system in the

32
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:41,158
United States but also to help us start

33
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,310
a discussion and start thinking more

34
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,409
broadly and you know rooted in the facts

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,320
and what's really going on here what's

36
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,219
misunderstood in this industry I think

37
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,758
there's so much and it's such an

38
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:58,500
open-ended question but I would start by

39
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:02,280
saying maybe you know yes you can patent

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,780
a plant there in the US like Trevor

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,840
mentioned is different than most other

42
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,550
countries in that there is a system

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,150
that's divided by whether it's seed

44
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,080
propagated or its clones asexually

45
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,719
propagated

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,690
and so plant patents that you see are a

47
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:22,469
sexually propagated clones and those are

48
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:24,599
just for the clone that one genetics it

49
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,169
so whatever else you see in the

50
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,180
description

51
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:30,269
that's all required in order to describe

52
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,390
that clone it still only covers that

53
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,090
clone and anything a sexually propagated

54
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:38,209
so would be identical genetics in terms

55
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,310
of infringement you'd be looking at

56
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,770
genetic testing and finding out that yes

57
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,020
the you know more likely than not this

58
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,870
is the same clone

59
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,439
there's also utility patents utility

60
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,840
punts aren't limited by whether it's a

61
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:58,319
sexually propagated or seed propagated

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,360
and you can they do require a seed

63
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,569
deposit which currently in the United

64
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,720
States you cannot deposit seeds within a

65
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:10,500
USC Bank but you can deposit in Scotland

66
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:13,709
and you can have a utility patent that

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,080
would be somewhat broader and we can

68
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,180
talk a lot about the scope of patents

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,920
and whether or not you know going for

70
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,260
too broad of scope which I think we've

71
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,619
seen some of with biotech industries LLC

72
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:29,909
might actually get you a invalid and

73
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:34,230
invalid patent so that's utility patents

74
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:37,650
and I skipped over USDA protection USDA

75
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:41,159
protection is the plant breeders rights

76
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,830
and you see that internationally that

77
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,659
there are programs set up around the

78
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,600
world each of them might differ slightly

79
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,819
u.s. differs right now because it is

80
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:55,319
only for seed propagate propagated

81
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:57,870
cultivars but it is for they are opening

82
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:01,009
it up to a sexually reproduced cultivars

83
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,959
but that's under USDA control USDA

84
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:06,299
following the 2018 farm bill and as most

85
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,800
of you are aware USDA hasn't set forth

86
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,600
what their regulations and requirements

87
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,600
are going to be but we hope they're

88
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,209
coming soon the one thing about that is

89
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,310
that you do have to make a deposit to

90
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:20,129
get that type of protection currently

91
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,740
for seed propagated it's 2,500 seats and

92
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:26,939
they go through the u.s. testing to

93
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:30,030
determine that it is a stable line

94
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:33,889
that's the patent and plants side of

95
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:37,469
things and then Trevor also mentioned

96
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,909
trademarks and currently what I'm seeing

97
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,910
and I think that there was some

98
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,290
discussion today if you know patents

99
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,010
isn't the way that you're thinking about

100
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,410
going

101
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:49,259
you have trademarks as an option for

102
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,210
protecting your brand and that is you

103
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,599
know that you are the source of these

104
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:56,430
genetics and that nobody else can use

105
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,600
that brand name because that brand name

106
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:03,750
designates you as a source that's sort

107
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,890
of a very high-level overview of what's

108
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,589
available

109
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:11,009
there's also trade secret and I guess if

110
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:13,919
you're vertically integrated and you are

111
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:16,500
not worried about your clones getting

112
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,300
out or any of your breeding techniques

113
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,480
or things your protect them with trade

114
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,650
secret you can do that provided that

115
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,590
everything remains in your control and

116
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:27,299
everything remains secret you do have to

117
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:29,789
take protect you do have to have

118
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,560
precautions that would protect your

119
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,210
secret and you do have to be able to

120
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,860
establish that you have taken

121
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:37,169
protections to protect your seat or

122
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:41,520
taken precautions to protect your secret

123
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:45,240
in order to have any claim for damages

124
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:48,289
in in a lawsuit that's trade secret and

125
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,560
then copyright is the last branch of IP

126
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,330
copyright is more for creative works but

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,740
can be used for logos and then you know

128
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,370
other thing that I see a lot of in this

129
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,490
industry

130
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,389
a lot of pictures of your genetics

131
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,829
whether or not you're protecting those

132
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,209
pictures whether or not other people are

133
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:04,918
using those pictures especially on

134
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,969
social media are they just reposting

135
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,449
your pictures without your permission

136
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:12,510
and so there are all these different

137
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,219
layers of IP protection but the one that

138
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:19,399
I see the most talked about right now is

139
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:22,410
patents and so the point there is that

140
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:25,229
there's an incredibly complicated system

141
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:28,919
it's in flux right now because it's

142
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:31,230
changing literally right now the USDA is

143
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,549
drafting their regulations with regard

144
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,450
to how they're going to deal

145
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:39,720
specifically with hemp plant variety

146
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:40,550
protection and those are for seeds so we

147
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,130
have see

148
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:46,040
protections for plant variety protection

149
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:49,449
x' this was created under the 1970s

150
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,710
plant variety Protection Act before that

151
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:55,430
dating all the way back to the 1930s

152
00:06:51,709 --> 00:07:00,099
people could get protections for clone

153
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:03,980
only varieties essentially the plant

154
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:08,689
fruit tree producers lobbied the

155
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:13,360
Congress to pass the Pat plant patent

156
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:16,550
Act of 1930 so that's why clonally

157
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,620
reproduced plants are held under a

158
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,689
different sort of system this is why the

159
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,540
United States is totally different than

160
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:28,310
everybody else everybody else has plant

161
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:30,740
patent the PvP plant variety protection

162
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,709
x' apply to everything in the United

163
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,990
States we have two separate systems

164
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:40,569
where plant variety protection x' apply

165
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:43,870
to seeds and plant patents apply to

166
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:46,610
clones correct

167
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:50,269
but that is going to change and that is

168
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:53,990
going to change and that's why so much

169
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:56,870
of this is in flux and is really

170
00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:00,410
something that is a gamble people like

171
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:03,829
biotech industries are seeing this

172
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:07,370
emerging legalization and are pursuing

173
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:10,699
an IP strategy that is very similar and

174
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,530
akin to what big tech was doing but well

175
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,289
it wasn't big tech back in the day but

176
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,689
in the 1980s Silicon Valley people were

177
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:20,360
just gobbling up patents and patenting

178
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:22,339
all sorts of things that may or may not

179
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,330
have been unique and they were setting

180
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:29,569
very my new patents up and collecting

181
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:31,669
all of them as an IP strategy biotech

182
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,129
seems to be pursuing a similar strategy

183
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,649
right now because it's not even clear

184
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:40,159
that they could enforce or protect their

185
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:41,629
patents as it stands today they may be

186
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,269
able to in the future that correct

187
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:47,600
correct and one of the things that's

188
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:49,309
really interesting about the USPTO so we

189
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,360
have a government and I think that's

190
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:52,609
something that's really important to

191
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,220
realize is these are all different

192
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,750
government

193
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,660
agencies and they're all treating

194
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,578
cannabis very differently so and even

195
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:00,809
within a single agency so you have the

196
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:03,659
United States Patent and Trademark

197
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:05,458
Office that is responsible for issuing

198
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:07,169
both patents and trademarks reviewing

199
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,299
them issuing them and they treat them

200
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:10,500
completely separately and part of that

201
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,508
and so you'll hear a lot of

202
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,448
misinformation about no you can't get

203
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:17,459
patents because it's federally illegal

204
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:19,500
actually for patents that's not even one

205
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,659
of the inquiries of the Patent Office so

206
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,059
it has not been a hurdle and in fact

207
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:26,490
that there have been patents been

208
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,258
issuing for cannabis for a long time now

209
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,180
in fact I think the government applied

210
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:34,009
for theirs I think I want to say it like

211
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:36,539
1980 it's I don't know exactly

212
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:38,490
government does have patents on the life

213
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:41,519
protecting or you know life-saving

214
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:44,579
properties of cannabis which is a biting

215
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,078
irony so that's not an inquiry of the

216
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:48,688
Patent Office the Patent Office what

217
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:51,149
they want to know is is it new is it

218
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:52,759
well isn't useful have you described it

219
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:55,528
in order to meet the statutory

220
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,480
requirements and is it novel and

221
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,039
non-obvious over what was already known

222
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,528
in the art there is no inquiry about

223
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,849
whether it's you know there's any moral

224
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:08,458
or you know legal reason to not issue a

225
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,139
patent on that technology contrast that

226
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:13,500
with the Trademark Office which is the

227
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:15,480
same USPTO and the trademark office has

228
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,818
a requirement that you are using the

229
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,209
mark in commerce and in commerce has

230
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:23,370
historically been interpreted to mean

231
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:24,869
regulated by Congress so you know the

232
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,539
state can regulate what goes on within

233
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,308
the state but then once you move you

234
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,980
know outside of the state then you know

235
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:33,659
interstate would be in commerce and so

236
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,028
that is the issue with trademark

237
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:38,219
protection for cannabis is that you

238
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:41,068
can't show lawfully that you are using

239
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,500
your mark in commerce not for anything

240
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:45,628
that's federally illegal you can for

241
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,068
ancillary parts of your business that

242
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:49,649
are federally legal or that don't

243
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:53,009
present the issues of the CSA and now

244
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:55,289
even after the farm bill and once the

245
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:57,329
USDA gets their regulations out and

246
00:10:55,289 --> 00:11:00,419
we're able to show that we can use the

247
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:03,000
marks and commerce for hemp even still

248
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,860
for CBD for example their trademark

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,009
office is still going to look at the

250
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,800
Food Drug and Cosmetic

251
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:10,210
so still that would be something that

252
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,929
you wouldn't be able to put that in

253
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:16,600
commerce and so the trademark office is

254
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:18,489
very literal in how they're issuing that

255
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,330
type of IP protection but you have the

256
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,370
same government agency the USPTO not

257
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,879
worrying about that at all as far as

258
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:30,669
patents are concerned and well hobby you

259
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,710
might have some experience here at least

260
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:36,159
observing how this is played out a

261
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:38,040
little bit in Amsterdam there's been

262
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:42,069
issues and controversies surrounding

263
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:45,250
names and there's been AI P strategies

264
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:48,879
predicated on trade marking names like

265
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:51,789
white widow and how was that played

266
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:56,169
yeah well I can't really speak to other

267
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:58,419
people's trademarks but I can I have I

268
00:11:56,169 --> 00:12:00,189
have there's three different companies

269
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:03,699
who have trademarks on plants that I've

270
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:07,120
bred that I don't have those trademarks

271
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:11,050
people just went and preempted me and

272
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,560
went and got trademarks and one

273
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:17,319
particular company actually acquired

274
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,239
some genetics of mine and they because

275
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,410
they understood that you couldn't

276
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,110
trademark the plant they just

277
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:26,230
trademarked every possible package that

278
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:29,560
the plant would be in from vape pens to

279
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:33,039
bottles to baseball caps and everything

280
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:37,079
so yeah and there's been I mean in

281
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:40,419
Amsterdam there was a lot of internal

282
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:43,990
battle going on between seed companies

283
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:47,139
over the rights to these different lines

284
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:51,340
and most of them didn't trademark them

285
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:54,519
until it was too late but there was also

286
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,290
I mean we could get into some nasty

287
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,289
stories but there was people who broke

288
00:12:56,289 --> 00:13:02,139
into you know people's grows and stole

289
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:05,129
clones and killed moms and then went and

290
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:07,299
trademarked that variety essentially or

291
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:08,710
didn't necessarily trademark the variety

292
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:15,219
that they killed but saw that there was

293
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:16,740
this opportunity and so in shyla

294
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,690
mentioned something really you know

295
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,419
relevant is that the trademark has more

296
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:25,480
value in many ways than the patent a

297
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:27,699
patent is as far as I understand very

298
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,250
difficult to enforce compared to a

299
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:34,840
trademark I would agree with that

300
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:36,639
although a patent can you have more

301
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,620
right so in terms of a trademark you can

302
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,779
prevent them from using your trademark

303
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,970
but a patent is what would allow you to

304
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,319
prevent them if you had a utility patent

305
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,389
for example you could even prevent them

306
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,879
from breeding with your genetics but if

307
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:51,009
you had a plant patent you couldn't

308
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,840
prevent that but in the case of having

309
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:55,960
stolen then you could you know certainly

310
00:13:52,840 --> 00:14:02,530
that they couldn't you know use it or

311
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:04,930
continue to use it and yeah the point I

312
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:07,269
was just gonna make was that we need to

313
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:09,579
be thinking individuals if you're out

314
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:12,759
there if you're branding you're you've

315
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:15,070
actually built a brand start thinking

316
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,710
about trademarks now and start thinking

317
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:20,110
about that ahead of time because your

318
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,960
brand could become hijacked from you

319
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,639
like so many have before we've

320
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,610
experienced this the Amsterdam

321
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,159
experience like we all have to a certain

322
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,960
extent the benefit of having seen what's

323
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,959
happened with other crops we talked

324
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,060
about that earlier be it crops like

325
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,700
apples or in the wine in the booze

326
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:41,500
industry we also have Amsterdam and we

327
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,900
can look to there's a historical example

328
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,309
for what has happened and how to protect

329
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:53,709
ourselves now one thing I'm wondering is

330
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:56,949
that what what strategy do we have as

331
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:59,050
breeders because it it seems to me the

332
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:02,050
biggest issue is prior art and novelty

333
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:04,569
and how far do you look into the

334
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:08,740
ecosystem to prove that there is prior

335
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:11,740
art or that a varieties novel so I've

336
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,440
been told that the USPTO is looking

337
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,360
further every day that they're gaining

338
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,790
new tools to actually look into this

339
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,039
cannabis issue but it seems that it's

340
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:24,579
really just first-come first-serve at

341
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:27,009
this point yes and there's a difference

342
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,389
between well first you have to reek you

343
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,740
always have to be clear whether you're

344
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:32,080
talking about a plant patent or a

345
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,190
utility patent so for a plant patent

346
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,639
because that's only can

347
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:40,720
that's only protecting a single clone or

348
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,370
single genetics then there isn't much

349
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,960
that you need to establish in terms of

350
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,710
novelty in fact the fact that you have

351
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,180
you know produce this new clone you know

352
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,830
it's different it's novel it's not

353
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:53,109
existed before and so that's just

354
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,330
accepted and and there isn't that hurdle

355
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,220
when you're talking about novelty you're

356
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,710
really talking about utility patents and

357
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,899
that is the biggest hurdle right now is

358
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,580
because this you know we're talking

359
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,799
about an illegal industry there isn't a

360
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,259
lot of art to sell what was known in the

361
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:10,269
art before even though you know in the

362
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,919
culture everyone knows you know or you

363
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,809
probably have a lot more understanding

364
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,389
of what was known or you see these

365
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:18,459
patents and so you'll see companies like

366
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:21,429
biotech industries and I hate to keep

367
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:24,220
beating up on them but you know they

368
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:25,750
have this really broad patent coverage

369
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,430
and they were able to get it they're

370
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,529
able to convince an examiner at the

371
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:31,809
USPTO that this is novel and non-obvious

372
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:33,279
and they have a patent what's more

373
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,959
interesting is when we're going to see

374
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,569
if they're going to be asserted because

375
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:41,440
what happens once a patent is asserted

376
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,879
is that defendant gets to and typically

377
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,170
one of the first things they'll argue

378
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,059
the first two things they're gonna argue

379
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,139
one is that they're not infringing to

380
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:49,389
the patent is invalid

381
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,590
and if a defendant can invalidate a

382
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:53,879
patent in court

383
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:57,070
that's just God for everybody and so

384
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,450
that's one thing and I know we've talked

385
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,560
to IRB's not we've talked a little bit

386
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,200
but I've seen you talk a little bit with

387
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:06,009
Dale about the recent case law I think

388
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,779
it's in Colorado and one of the most

389
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:10,838
interesting things to me is is in what I

390
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:13,088
haven't seen yet and I hope to see is I

391
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:15,129
hope to see the community band around

392
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:16,750
that defendant and invalidate that

393
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,699
patent because it doesn't just help that

394
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,240
defendant as quickly this is United

395
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:24,789
right yes it doesn't just help that

396
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,880
defendant but it helps the community as

397
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:30,460
a whole and so I do think we're gonna

398
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,840
see a lot of very broad overreaching

399
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,500
patents

400
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:37,059
I don't our what I hope to see is I hope

401
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,619
to see the community band around and

402
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:40,509
help invalidate those patents you know

403
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:42,489
bring forth the prior art that we could

404
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:45,279
use to invalidate those types of patents

405
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,370
and then I hope that eventually we'll

406
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,859
see actual

407
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:50,599
it's for true innovation because there

408
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,639
is you know there's so many people

409
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:55,129
who've dedicated their entire lives -

410
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,170
you know innovating in this field and so

411
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,780
they deserve to be rewarded for that

412
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:02,090
innovation but right now it is a little

413
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:04,670
bit of a land grab and what they choose

414
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:07,250
to do with that we'll have to wait and

415
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:11,090
see we've already seen you know that one

416
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:13,849
that's been asserted and so my hope is

417
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:15,589
that it'll be invalidated but the other

418
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:17,329
thing that happens is you know there is

419
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:19,970
a lot going on behind the scenes as well

420
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:21,319
so they chose to pursue it in court the

421
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,460
other thing is to try and make everyone

422
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:26,839
pay royalties and so it isn't until you

423
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,610
ask someone to pay royalties and they

424
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,049
say no that you end up you know

425
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:34,849
typically that's how it happens you end

426
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:36,799
up in court so I in kind of one analogy

427
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:40,039
is I used to do a lot of work in the pet

428
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,619
Diagnostics industry and this was very

429
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:45,740
early on that I learned this is I was

430
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:48,379
doing a invalidity searched or an

431
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,150
invalidity opinion that I was doing a

432
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,429
search to see what sort of patents that

433
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,259
my client might be infringing on and

434
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:56,030
then I was giving an opinion on whether

435
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,740
you know we had a non infringement or an

436
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:59,420
invalidity position as to each of those

437
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,220
patents and there was one of them that

438
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,529
was clearly invalid it you know there

439
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,690
was prior art all over it and the claims

440
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:08,629
were way too broad and when I presented

441
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,519
it to the client clients response was

442
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:15,530
well everyone in the industry just pays

443
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:18,079
that royalty and so there is that that

444
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,609
can happen if people decide that it's

445
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,500
you know it's easier just to pay the

446
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:26,389
royalty that they're asking rather than

447
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:30,769
deal with it in court so this is the

448
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:34,370
game that's played and yeah one of the

449
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:36,500
things about IP and patents is that this

450
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:38,989
is a game that is being decided by

451
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,819
people that have deep pockets and it is

452
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:46,460
a patent litigation is always a

453
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:48,649
financial calculation and so for

454
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,779
individuals sometimes it's going to be

455
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:53,330
worth it just to pay the licensing fee

456
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:55,490
and not to pursue litigation because

457
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:57,349
you're up against a highly capitalized

458
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,609
firm that is going to be able to just

459
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:01,490
draw out litigation and

460
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:07,308
beat you other times there are certain

461
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:10,069
in distill it again very actively and

462
00:20:07,308 --> 00:20:12,769
aggressively and it remains to be seen

463
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:16,539
one thing I would like to kind of talk

464
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:19,849
about is different models there's so

465
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:22,339
we've talked about biotech I've you've

466
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:24,829
likened it to a land grab I've likened

467
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:29,740
it to the Silicon Valley in the tech

468
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:31,789
industry there's also Philo's by Llosa's

469
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:37,009
probably why I'm sitting on the stage

470
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:40,490
right now but so they've pretty clearly

471
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:43,190
adopted a the Monsanto model they're

472
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,980
looking at creating a plant production

473
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:49,100
pipeline wherein they will create tons

474
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:52,669
of a sexually produced plants that they

475
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:54,500
will seek patents on and will then sell

476
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:57,020
through a licensing arrangement with

477
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,048
different farmers the most likely

478
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:01,730
easiest way for them to do this we all

479
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:03,889
know that they're looking at powdery

480
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,990
mildew resistance if they identify

481
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,759
genetics that have powder mildew

482
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:11,808
resistance they can take that powder

483
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:15,019
mildew resistant gene introgression into

484
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:18,619
all of the existing clone only varieties

485
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:21,440
that we have Josh deez OG the chem the

486
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:24,048
cookies etc all of the varieties that

487
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,289
have large market share they could then

488
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:28,240
create powder mildew resistant blah blah

489
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:31,579
blah

490
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,558
that is what looks to be their strategy

491
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:36,470
they've written it out they've talked

492
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:38,529
about it Mowgli's talked about this at

493
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,279
the AEI see which is a big biotech

494
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:45,829
conglomerate where they all get together

495
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:48,740
and share their plans that model is that

496
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:50,539
model one that is here now that

497
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,690
literally could be rolled out and

498
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:56,178
implemented today or is this a model

499
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,779
that they're looking five years down the

500
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:02,390
road where we could essentially roll

501
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:05,389
this out if we start now be ready by the

502
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,970
time federal prohibition ends or is this

503
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:10,759
like literally today could Philo start

504
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,250
pumping out tons of clone only powder

505
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,160
milk

506
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,960
resisting clone only varieties not even

507
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,060
genetically modified this is just

508
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,569
traditional breeding this is

509
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:24,419
marker-assisted back crossing so you say

510
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:27,659
here's we've demonstrated that this

511
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,940
genetic is powder mildew resistant

512
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,310
it's because of these specific markers

513
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,190
that it is powder mildew resistant and

514
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:37,500
now we take those markers and Trog rest

515
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,470
them cross them into these other

516
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,230
genetics and then just back cross it do

517
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,559
you know who's doing that work for him I

518
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:49,200
mean the actual work the actual work

519
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:52,559
no like I mean to the extent there are

520
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,509
people who we assume might be doing it

521
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:58,589
but we can't really say because they

522
00:22:54,509 --> 00:23:00,779
won't come clean on it but you know we

523
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:05,429
we suspect that there are certain

524
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:09,119
individuals in I mean well I would say

525
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:11,990
that that possibly their intention was

526
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:14,789
to crowdsource that information that

527
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,440
when and this is why you know most

528
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:21,599
people have submitted samples to Philo's

529
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:24,660
myself included if it came with no chemo

530
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,759
tipic data no terpene analysis you know

531
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,519
can habit analysis it really is little

532
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:32,069
value to them for this breeding project

533
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,109
that they're embarking on but boy did

534
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:35,609
they I'm sure they wanted it so if

535
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:36,990
everyone who submitted a sample said oh

536
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:38,669
by the way mine is powdery mildew

537
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,400
resistant sure that goes searching for

538
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,990
that marker in that sample or looking

539
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,360
for a common marker within all the

540
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,180
people who submitted that hey - powdery

541
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:52,259
mildew resistant but most people didn't

542
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:55,529
so so it was a lost opportunity for them

543
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:57,119
that forced them to embark on their own

544
00:23:55,529 --> 00:24:00,119
breeding program in order to identify

545
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:04,259
those markers because the galaxy didn't

546
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:06,509
fulfill that that goal yeah and that was

547
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:09,539
really stage 2 like the discovery

548
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:12,599
project as it's been dubbed by them was

549
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:14,789
specifically about this and I've read

550
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,149
the contract that they presented to

551
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:20,159
heroes of the farms and it's very clear

552
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:22,380
from that contract that they were trying

553
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,080
to identify powdery mildew resistant

554
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,549
varieties in his genetics

555
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:29,668
and they were claiming to be able to

556
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:35,069
bring others to bear now they took that

557
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:36,659
same deal to at least 16 other producers

558
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:40,138
breeders who have historically been

559
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:42,509
breeding and growing I don't know who

560
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:44,638
actually agreed to move forward with

561
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:47,038
them I know for a fact the Patrick of

562
00:24:44,638 --> 00:24:50,038
heroes of the farm said no way and never

563
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,888
signed anything with them but that's our

564
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:55,169
concern like real talk a lot of people

565
00:24:52,888 --> 00:25:01,019
are concerned about five OSes ability

566
00:24:55,169 --> 00:25:03,538
not only just like to steal not steal

567
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,190
but crowdsource and crowdfund a whole

568
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,079
bunch of information and create an

569
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,538
opportunity across where we just put

570
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,398
into their system but what is the

571
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:13,888
possibility that they're going to now

572
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:17,878
take the information that they have and

573
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:20,128
build out a Monsanto type pipeline where

574
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:22,709
they're producing plants that they're

575
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:25,138
able to then get patents on is that

576
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,909
something they could do today absolutely

577
00:25:25,138 --> 00:25:29,398
I think you know anytime that you're

578
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:31,320
creating a new clone or a new variety

579
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:33,589
then yes absolutely you can get a plant

580
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:38,519
patent but remember it is for that

581
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:41,398
specific clone so but the issue comes

582
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:43,739
with big AG in that if you're talking

583
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:46,079
about a commodities market and they can

584
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:48,690
grow it more efficiently and effectively

585
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,730
and produce it you know your your

586
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,909
genetics with you know this resistance

587
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:55,798
in it that's where the Monsanto's of the

588
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:57,749
world come from that and they did it

589
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:59,220
with genetically modified but you know

590
00:25:57,749 --> 00:26:01,739
if you're saying do the same thing with

591
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,778
marker-assisted breeding then yes if you

592
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:05,850
have something that you know in if you

593
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:07,648
eventually get it to a stable seed loin

594
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:10,048
and you can distribute seeds and have

595
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:11,038
everybody growing this more efficiently

596
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,319
than anyone else

597
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,538
then then yes they can get patent

598
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:19,378
protection on that now as long as you're

599
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:20,429
not growing their genetics then you're

600
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:22,048
you don't have a problem from an

601
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:24,179
infringement standpoint but you

602
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:25,769
absolutely might have a problem from an

603
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:29,159
efficiency in keeping up with them

604
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:32,128
standpoint yeah no this is a big concern

605
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,740
the ability of the Monsanto's or large

606
00:26:32,128 --> 00:26:37,168
capitalized AG they're able to bring

607
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,809
economies of scale and the main concern

608
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:41,250
is

609
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:45,099
that we as producers license cultivators

610
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:47,349
don't buy into the hype of efficiencies

611
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:51,279
and economies of scale but stay true to

612
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:52,869
what we've historically done selecting

613
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,920
the thing that may not be the largest

614
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:59,259
yield there but is the best best for our

615
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,539
particular needs and desires and what

616
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:03,940
we're trying to produce and create here

617
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:05,589
and so we need to recognize that while

618
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,470
there are companies that are going to

619
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:12,849
pursue these IP strategies we got to

620
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:14,710
develop our own responses and not not

621
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:16,990
get caught up in the hype you know and

622
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:18,579
we also need to not don't you think

623
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,849
they're gonna just really select for

624
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:26,139
size and yield absolutely yeah right I

625
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:27,849
mean over yeah well think about Monsanto

626
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,980
since we're talking about Monsanto what

627
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:34,299
was the main thing that they sold to the

628
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:36,700
world Roundup Ready Roundup Ready so it

629
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:39,339
was it was they said hey this is a seed

630
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,500
that can take the beating from the

631
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:42,759
pesticides and all the crap that were

632
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,420
the herbicides that we're gonna also

633
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:48,160
sell to you so it was a little bit of

634
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,830
shame on you farmer for buying that

635
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,320
dream a little bit and it's the same

636
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:55,929
thing with with biotech and and these

637
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:59,710
patented varieties is that if you if it

638
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:01,420
becomes the overwhelming the the the

639
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,490
cultivar of choice where a lot of people

640
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,230
bought into Monsanto's dream they said

641
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,630
wow I really have a problem with weeds

642
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,269
and I would really rather kill all these

643
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:12,100
weeds and still be able to grow my crops

644
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:13,539
where the people who didn't mind weeds

645
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:14,889
and we're growing biodynamic they're

646
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,990
organically didn't have any I didn't

647
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,540
have a an issue with it it wasn't until

648
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:21,009
the drift thing when Monsanto said oh

649
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:22,569
well some of that pollen drifted over

650
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:24,339
into your cornfield and we tested your

651
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:25,509
corn and it shows that it has our genes

652
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:28,000
in it and therefore you can't grow your

653
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:29,920
corn you know so they get bigger and

654
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,839
bigger and their impact becomes stronger

655
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,730
and stronger and they control a bigger

656
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,849
market share of whatever crop they're

657
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:41,589
producing but it's really resisting that

658
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:43,119
is our our strength at this point I see

659
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:45,459
it a little bit differently I think with

660
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,409
the Roundup Ready when you're talking

661
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,299
about organic farming I mean that's a

662
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,900
lot more expensive process to do so

663
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,819
unless you have

664
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,650
market who's gonna pay for that then

665
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:55,000
you're forced to compete so I don't

666
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,710
think it's necessary that the farmers

667
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,759
I'm sure some of them bought into the

668
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,920
dream but I think some of them were

669
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,230
forced into it just from a pure survival

670
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,330
standpoint like could they produce you

671
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,450
know their corn at the same price and

672
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:08,319
sell it and still have a profit margin

673
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,410
compared to all the farmers who were

674
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:14,349
selling the Roundup Ready corn and so I

675
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:18,700
mean I think that that's you know an

676
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:19,719
unfortunate reality of big AG and one of

677
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,710
the things that you mentioned about the

678
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,910
the pollen blown into the crops and I

679
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,650
know that something people are very

680
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:28,450
afraid of and it's something that I

681
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,460
looked into because I wasn't sure very

682
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,230
much myself but I ended up reading the

683
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,360
case law and where that came from was

684
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,950
that was actually one of the farmers

685
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,799
defense when they were sued by Monsanto

686
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:40,240
they said that you know the wind they

687
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,710
didn't know how they ended up with their

688
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,529
you know with this growing in their

689
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,970
field and that maybe it was the wind

690
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:48,579
that had blown it into their field

691
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,990
actually what was found out is they had

692
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,329
bought the seed from the back of a truck

693
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,700
somebody else has leftover seed and it

694
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:56,710
was something I've seen numbers between

695
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,660
60 and 90 percent of their crop was

696
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,009
Roundup Ready and that they also knew it

697
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,380
was Roundup Ready because they had

698
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:07,470
sprayed it and noticed it was Roundup

699
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,470
Ready so that's a little bit of a myth

700
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:13,629
but that is really a good point like

701
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:17,019
what we're faced with right now is a

702
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,780
proprietary economic model and it is a

703
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:22,119
predatory economic model so they will

704
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:24,609
try to maximize their control of the

705
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:27,339
market share and leverage their

706
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:29,889
economies of scale in ways that are

707
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:33,099
designed to try and push us out and so

708
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:36,580
we need to be able to bring our own IP

709
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:38,829
strategies to bear and part of that's

710
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:41,169
going to be pursuing trademarks for our

711
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:44,379
brands some of that's going to be in

712
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:47,590
certain instances when it's appropriate

713
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:51,820
people pursuing plant variety protection

714
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:55,599
and patent protection another version of

715
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:57,750
IP protection that I'm not sure how well

716
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,099
you versed on it but I know that

717
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:03,230
appellations of origin or something that

718
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:06,109
the state has mandated for us to create

719
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:09,440
California is going to create a Palacios

720
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:14,119
for cannabis and they're mandated to do

721
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,890
so by January 1st of 2021 licensed

722
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:19,129
cultivators will be able to submit

723
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:22,610
applications laying out standards

724
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:25,610
practices and varietals that are grown

725
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:28,069
within a particular region that can

726
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:30,500
apply for appellation standards or

727
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:33,319
status and you'll be able to essentially

728
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:35,779
apply a sticker to your plant there to

729
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:37,700
your products and say this was produced

730
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:40,210
here under these standards these

731
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,789
practices and with these varietals and

732
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,950
this is a Palacios are a form of

733
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:48,649
intellectual property they're a

734
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:50,690
collective form of intellectual property

735
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,509
and so this is something that we can

736
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:56,029
everybody needs to look in to read up on

737
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:58,819
it check it out get with licensed

738
00:31:56,029 --> 00:32:00,798
cultivators in your own area and start

739
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:03,710
thinking about these things and start

740
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,869
thinking about them in a way where what

741
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,179
are the standards the practices and the

742
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:10,879
cultivars that are unique to your place

743
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:13,490
what are the outcomes that are unique to

744
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,710
your place because I know where I'm at

745
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:19,069
we have a very unique environment that

746
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:21,650
is very distinct from up in Mendo or

747
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:23,928
humble or in other areas because we're

748
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:26,900
more inland it's much drier much hotter

749
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:29,870
much more arid environment their unique

750
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:34,100
outcomes and results so if I grow a

751
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:36,589
cultivar in my County or in my hillside

752
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:38,509
it's going to be way different than that

753
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:40,250
same cultivar grown up and humbled and

754
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:43,569
this is something that could be very

755
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:48,230
unique we could have people essentially

756
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:52,548
saying okay Calaveras County we grow og

757
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:55,519
and the og ends up like this over an

758
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:57,889
Mendo they grow the same cultivar but it

759
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,769
ends up expressing differently

760
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:04,130
we're both protecting the intellectual

761
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:06,048
property and the specific product that

762
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:08,360
we're producing that's unique to our

763
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:11,839
areas and even though we're both calling

764
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:14,779
it og it's different and it's different

765
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:17,119
because of the environmental inputs that

766
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:19,009
you know I mean we all know the fee note

767
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,500
types are an interaction between the

768
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:24,170
gene and the environment and those

769
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,349
environmental factors are going to

770
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:30,740
produce unique distinct intellectual

771
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:33,169
properties and product properties that

772
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,660
we can hopefully protect and this is

773
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:39,170
something it's going to be rolled out by

774
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:41,300
2021 we can start to organize around

775
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:44,180
these ideas now and start to develop

776
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:45,829
this is a more of a communal or

777
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,650
collective form of intellectual property

778
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:50,269
so we've got individual corporate

779
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,880
strategies if you've got a business

780
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:55,220
start thinking about trademarks start

781
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,870
thinking about patents start thinking

782
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,420
about the implications that it has for

783
00:33:56,869 --> 00:34:00,919
you for better and for worse and also

784
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,470
start thinking about linking up with

785
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:07,820
fellow cultivators in your area to

786
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:09,769
develop an appalachia system and I'm not

787
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:12,378
as familiar with that but it sounds to

788
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:14,269
me like a trademark type protection so

789
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:17,599
that would be like a certification mark

790
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:19,878
we're only in again trademarks identify

791
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,710
the source of the goods so that would

792
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:23,980
identify the source is coming from this

793
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:26,570
one specific region a lot like

794
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:31,940
champagnes or even tequila is regulated

795
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:33,740
now and so no I was the one who

796
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,220
introduced Dale to tequila and set the

797
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:39,500
record straight it was interesting you

798
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:42,349
may both appellation because the

799
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:45,619
challenge with an appellation is that it

800
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:48,168
can limit what you can do so let's let's

801
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:49,128
remember that that like for instance you

802
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:52,730
mentioned champagne

803
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:55,179
what is champagne champagne is Pinot

804
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:59,090
Noir or Chardonnay grapes grown in

805
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:02,180
Champagne period that's it same with

806
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:05,240
Bordeaux Bordeaux is I believe Cabernet

807
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:07,190
Merlot Petit Verdot and one other great

808
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:10,279
so if you want to grow an Italian

809
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:12,470
varietal in Bordeaux France you cannot

810
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,660
call it Bordeaux you can call it

811
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:18,230
Sangiovese but no one's gonna buy it

812
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:20,659
so Bordeaux the Bordeaux wine makers and

813
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,929
the begonia winemaker Association got

814
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:28,489
together and mandated what can be grown

815
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:30,059
in this appellation so it can go the

816
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:31,469
wrong way when big win big

817
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:32,670
corporate interest get in there and say

818
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:34,500
no we're trying to protect this

819
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,210
appellation and this is can only be

820
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,780
ground here and it's the variety the

821
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:41,579
variety that we happen to own that's

822
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:45,360
absolutely true one good thing about

823
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:48,690
this system is that it is driven by the

824
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,640
licensees so licensees it's a form of

825
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,559
local control that we have it's probably

826
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:56,519
the only decent form of local control

827
00:35:52,559 --> 00:36:00,329
that came out of prop 64 so if you are a

828
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:02,070
local licensed cultivator definitely be

829
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:04,710
thinking about this and get out there in

830
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:09,030
front because all of these IP strategies

831
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:10,920
all across the board have risks and

832
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,050
benefits there are ways that this could

833
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,690
protect people in the industry and there

834
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:17,490
are ways that it could be used by other

835
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:20,090
capitalized interests that are trying to

836
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:22,589
push all of us out and so we definitely

837
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:24,960
we got to take hold of the tools that

838
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:27,420
are at our disposal and make sure that

839
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,970
we're in there playing the game and not

840
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,680
just getting pushed out but the

841
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:33,779
appellation it seems like what it would

842
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,669
do is prevent let's say somebody from

843
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:39,180
New Jersey saying that they are growing

844
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:41,340
you know weed from here but I don't see

845
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:43,859
the protection in the form of making

846
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:47,070
sure that your genetics your particular

847
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:49,200
genetics are protected and so it is a

848
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:51,930
form of IP it is a trademark right and

849
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,639
so in that sense it absolutely is but I

850
00:36:51,929 --> 00:36:55,949
don't see it offering the full

851
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:57,480
protection in terms of actually

852
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:58,859
protecting your clones and actually

853
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,309
protecting your life's work and what

854
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,990
you're what you're doing and in that

855
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:06,299
regard what I hope to see and maybe that

856
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:08,339
will be part of it is I hope to see

857
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,470
communities start to pull together their

858
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:13,530
patents and their IP and you've seen

859
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:15,329
this in other industries where you know

860
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:17,040
they will pool patents either that

861
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:19,409
there's two different forms of it either

862
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:22,259
that you're all gonna allow each other

863
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:24,420
to use each other's technology without

864
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,710
the threat of of having this these

865
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,090
patents asserted against them so

866
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,800
everybody brings their patents to the

867
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,990
table puts them in the middle and

868
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,670
everybody has access to that you know

869
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:34,289
the other form of it you know in terms

870
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,329
of you can use all of this patented

871
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:38,369
technology the other form is everybody

872
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:40,289
puts their patents together in terms of

873
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:42,659
defending against a lawsuit so we agree

874
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:43,509
you know the four of us agree if any of

875
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:45,549
us get sued

876
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,680
you can use my patents his patents you

877
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,539
know and because the best thing to do

878
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,309
when you get sued is to have have a

879
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:53,320
counter defense to be able to counter

880
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:55,960
just quickly where have you seen these

881
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,640
two strategies played out so if you look

882
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,800
at like Android technology for example

883
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:01,960
the way that they've been able to build

884
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,590
that platform is they allow everybody

885
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,630
from Google to LG to Samsung to Oh to

886
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,039
use their you know the different patents

887
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,840
they all pull their patents together so

888
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,059
they can all build on that platform and

889
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,850
so you know there's a difference though

890
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:18,279
with with software and that software

891
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:20,529
comes with its own IP software's

892
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,269
protected as soon as you write your

893
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,430
program it's got copyright protection

894
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:27,009
attached to it you can do anything to

895
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:28,509
get the copyright or protection you

896
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,280
should register it but you don't have to

897
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,990
it's a little bit tougher in the

898
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,450
Cannabis scenario where you would

899
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:37,269
actually have to file and get patent

900
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:39,219
protection or your your plant breeders

901
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:41,949
rights attached to it but then you would

902
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:43,449
then agree to share that but that you

903
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:45,460
know it's done in others but that's the

904
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:48,849
most familiar one that I can think of

905
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:51,039
off the top of my head when we're

906
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:53,619
talking about patents and these sorts of

907
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:56,349
IP strategies what type of costs are we

908
00:38:53,619 --> 00:39:00,279
talking about are we is it even viable

909
00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:03,369
for somebody like myself to consider

910
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,500
pursuing a patent and break that down

911
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:08,199
both in terms of the application process

912
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:12,820
and also in terms of the defense or the

913
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:15,819
prosecution right so in prosecution I

914
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:19,450
know to file a plant patent I would

915
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:23,680
ballpark that around $2,500 just to file

916
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:25,899
and that's to have the description in

917
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,969
order and every way that you need it you

918
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,680
know obviously the person that you hire

919
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:31,389
who's more experienced is going to be

920
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,519
able to write it more thoroughly and

921
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:36,250
correctly in a way that you shouldn't

922
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:38,050
expect as many office actions and not

923
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,239
make you know typical mistakes that I'm

924
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,769
seen in some of these patent patent

925
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,679
applications that are being filed plant

926
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:47,889
patent in particular so that's for a

927
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:50,799
plant patent and then in terms of

928
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:54,489
prosecuting it you know getting it from

929
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,980
your original filing all the way through

930
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:58,509
I asked Dale because he does more plant

931
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:02,099
than I do actually I don't do any I

932
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:05,430
refer them to him I do trademarks and so

933
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:08,409
he ballparked it I want to say around

934
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:10,629
$10,000 is what you're looking at over

935
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:13,480
the course of obtaining the protection

936
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:16,710
which could take a few years trademarks

937
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,940
is a little bit less expensive I

938
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:21,460
typically encourage everyone to do a

939
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,289
thorough search before they file for

940
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,750
their trademark protection and that's

941
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:27,250
because trademarks you have common law

942
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,989
rights as soon as you start to use a

943
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,210
trademark so if I'm using a trademark

944
00:40:28,989 --> 00:40:32,799
here in California someone in Florida

945
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,510
decides to file their trademark

946
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,119
application for that same mark

947
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:39,369
I still have common law rights as far as

948
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,039
I've used it and established that

949
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:44,340
trademark they can't shut me down just

950
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:46,420
because they've now filed and so

951
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,940
particularly in this industry where I

952
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:53,440
see everybody using the same marks which

953
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:58,720
by the way don't like let's just start

954
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:01,809
using more original marks and so in in

955
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:04,149
that way you know I do encourage doing a

956
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:05,440
full search so that you're aware of what

957
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,450
are the common law rights that somebody

958
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,159
else might have even though you get

959
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:11,289
federal protection where are you gonna

960
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:12,519
be limited from using your mark or where

961
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:14,349
are you not going to be able to shut

962
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:19,539
down this mom-and-pop shop who's been

963
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:21,250
using it since you know 1980 so if you

964
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:22,358
were to get the full search and the

965
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,400
trademark application you're looking

966
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:26,469
again at about $2,000 to file a

967
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,780
trademark application for a single class

968
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:32,379
of goods and that includes the USPTO

969
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:34,660
fees and then if you've done your search

970
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:37,329
and you don't get these more substantive

971
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:40,139
rejections in terms of finding marks

972
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:42,880
that are confusingly similar then

973
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:44,319
there's only a couple other time points

974
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,358
where you need to spend you know an

975
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:49,710
another three hundred five hundred its

976
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:52,239
so I would say probably just ballparking

977
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:55,139
three thousand four thousand to get a

978
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,909
trademark if it goes through cleanly

979
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:59,710
utility patents much more expensive it's

980
00:41:57,909 --> 00:42:01,750
a much more thorough disclosure you

981
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:03,340
don't have opportunities to amend the

982
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,139
way that you do with a plant patents so

983
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:09,519
everything has to be done right from the

984
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:10,420
outset so utility patents you can get

985
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,489
depending

986
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,139
on what your disclosure is what your

987
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:15,699
technology is how broadly you want to

988
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:17,588
claim it if you wanted to just claim

989
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,689
your deposit that's obviously gonna be

990
00:42:17,588 --> 00:42:23,318
less work than trying to claim some

991
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:27,309
broad formulation and so that can range

992
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:29,199
in terms of filing I would say again

993
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:31,510
probably starting up to 3,000 and I've

994
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:33,338
seen patents just for drafting a patent

995
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,319
application go up to the ten fifteen

996
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:38,230
thousand dollars to draft a patent

997
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:39,969
application copyrights much less

998
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:42,400
expensive you can do it yourself if you

999
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:45,489
care to go through all the tedious

1000
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,338
screens on the copyright registration

1001
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:50,108
portal or whatever what you have you and

1002
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:52,119
I think it's $55 to register your

1003
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:54,578
copyright so some of your more priced

1004
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:56,289
pictures your videos I've seen people

1005
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:59,349
getting very creative with how they're

1006
00:42:56,289 --> 00:43:01,599
advertising their genetics like you know

1007
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:03,789
register you're more important stuff for

1008
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,730
copyright protection and then I think I

1009
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:08,859
saw Dale quote the plant variety

1010
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,778
protection I think he said something

1011
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:15,880
about it's fifty one hundred dollars

1012
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:19,599
just in the filing fees alone so it's

1013
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,759
not inexpensive so so just quickly

1014
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,000
because we have a band that has to set

1015
00:43:21,759 --> 00:43:27,929
up for the people for the two people on

1016
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
the stage who have unique genetics

1017
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:35,500
what's your strategy for protecting your

1018
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:39,338
intellectual property and well my

1019
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:43,659
strategy was to not share was was to I

1020
00:43:39,338 --> 00:43:46,568
mean I started breeding sage in 1994 in

1021
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:49,899
Amsterdam and I you know was just a

1022
00:43:46,568 --> 00:43:52,329
young guy living overseas and plenty of

1023
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:56,588
people offered me money for cuts over

1024
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:59,048
and over again seed banks traveling

1025
00:43:56,588 --> 00:44:01,298
American cultivators and I turned him

1026
00:43:59,048 --> 00:44:03,849
down over and over again over and over

1027
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:05,710
and over again and the few people that I

1028
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:08,740
did give plants that were very

1029
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:10,750
explicitly told not to share them that

1030
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:15,278
this was a backup that I need you to

1031
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:17,259
hold on and and it one of my varieties

1032
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:18,969
got out because someone stole it as

1033
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:20,409
simple as that someone stole it out of

1034
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:22,028
the grow room and sold it to another

1035
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:23,690
group and that group sold it to another

1036
00:44:22,028 --> 00:44:26,780
group and

1037
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:28,340
so it's it's trade secrets it's

1038
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,740
protecting your trade secrets by not

1039
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:33,530
letting him go and since that happened a

1040
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:37,009
number of years ago I have held plants

1041
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:39,200
even closer to the chest than before and

1042
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,910
that there's some some varieties that I

1043
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:44,059
think people should be enjoying that I

1044
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:45,799
haven't let out yet because I didn't

1045
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:48,170
have a robust tool to protect them

1046
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,170
because it's not just the physical

1047
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:54,349
security that they require in a facility

1048
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:55,760
but its ability to go out into the

1049
00:44:54,349 --> 00:45:00,110
ecosystem and make sure that other

1050
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,630
people aren't utilizing your plants so

1051
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:06,860
yeah that's what I'm doing and waiting

1052
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:11,450
to do great things in the future as much

1053
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:14,990
as that could say yeah for me it's

1054
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:16,789
different I didn't create OG but really

1055
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:18,799
more importantly I think everybody

1056
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:23,300
should grow oh gee like as a variety in

1057
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,340
their garden right so that would make me

1058
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,070
you know more happy than anything right

1059
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:30,140
now is if it just ended up all over the

1060
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:31,610
country all over the world and everybody

1061
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:34,369
you know had a piece of their farm

1062
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:37,970
growing it right nobody should get a cut

1063
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:39,980
for that that's ridiculous but in the

1064
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:42,049
future I mean then the other side of it

1065
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:44,300
is like holy shit I better I better

1066
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:46,160
think about this cuz I'm gonna be paying

1067
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:49,640
a lot of money in licensing fees right

1068
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:52,190
and that's that's just the irony right

1069
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:53,989
now but you know so of course we're

1070
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,170
looking into it you know it's a it's a

1071
00:45:53,989 --> 00:45:59,209
strange thing but I mean I just don't

1072
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:00,470
for me it's hard to come to terms with

1073
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,179
this but we're gonna do some breeding

1074
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:06,079
projects in the future I mean for me

1075
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:07,940
it's all about the future you know you

1076
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,739
know and then we'll talk about patenting

1077
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:13,909
something that is actually something we

1078
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:15,289
created you know Pat going out to like

1079
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:16,670
we're gonna go to a clone shop somebody

1080
00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:18,559
with some cash we're gonna buy likes our

1081
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:20,809
D all these things are just gonna Pat

1082
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:21,860
and everything spend like a billion

1083
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:24,259
dollars like I'm just gonna patent the

1084
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:27,050
whole library everything out there yeah

1085
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,670
that's and that is the reality also

1086
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:31,760
since I mean we talk about Philo's

1087
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:33,170
earlier and like Philo says is kind of

1088
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,970
you know they're the bad guy right now

1089
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,619
because they came from our community

1090
00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:39,078
but the reality is is all these plants

1091
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:41,510
are in there are in the ecosystem

1092
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:43,280
they're all available at a shop or in

1093
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:46,940
seat for him anyone can go online and

1094
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,619
buy all the most amazing seed and they

1095
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,450
can go to shops all over California and

1096
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:55,039
get all the most amazing buds and you

1097
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:57,559
can buy clones so yeah we're we it is

1098
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,358
about the future because up until this

1099
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,730
moment we were working under a different

1100
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,500
umbrella and now we're working in a

1101
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:05,088
totally different world and we're

1102
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,608
structuring things differently

1103
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:09,650
breeding trademarks patents everything

1104
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:12,078
but the past is the past

1105
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:14,960
you know and Philo's kind of speak spoke

1106
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,670
to that in a way and you know they were

1107
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,769
the bad guy because they were from us

1108
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:20,420
but everyone's doing the same thing you

1109
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,980
know there's there's biotech companies

1110
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,329
all around the world and pharmaceutical

1111
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,699
companies all around the world and

1112
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:28,339
people who go into the rainforest to

1113
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:31,608
exploit you know whatever they can get

1114
00:47:28,338 --> 00:47:33,920
their hands on you know so that's that's

1115
00:47:31,608 --> 00:47:36,650
the world we live in and with that I'm

1116
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,588
told that the band that's gonna rock the

1117
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:44,519
house from 9 p.m. on needs to get on

1118
00:47:39,588 --> 00:47:46,769
stage so thank you

1119
00:47:44,519 --> 00:48:03,210
[Applause]

1120
00:47:46,769 --> 00:48:05,610
thank you I've been doing IP law for 17

1121
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:07,949
years now and I was in the biotech

1122
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:10,710
industry not biotech industries ll see

1123
00:48:07,949 --> 00:48:13,230
the actual biotech industry in for 14

1124
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:17,130
years prosecuting pets for cancer

1125
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:20,309
immunology therapies and buying that

1126
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:23,789
came to cannabis via canna kids

1127
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:25,590
Tracy Ryan and Sophie Ryan I began

1128
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:29,029
following them as part of my passion of

1129
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:31,410
finding a cure for cancer and became so

1130
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,210
intrigued and inspired by what they were

1131
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:35,699
doing that found myself all the way into

1132
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,559
the cannabis industry and in January

1133
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:39,629
this year decided to start my own firm

1134
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:42,389
because one of the hurdles I was facing

1135
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:43,920
as a big law attorney was the

1136
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:45,269
limitations that my friend was placing

1137
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:50,550
on me about whether or not they wanted

1138
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:51,960
to have cannabis clients and so that's a

1139
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:56,190
little bit about my background but in

1140
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,720
terms of what I do so I had a I had to

1141
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,940
share in practice many of you might know

1142
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:02,969
Dale hunt Dale and I had a practice

1143
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,800
together and so we've done biotech plant

1144
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:08,189
patents AG patents

1145
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,730
green tech and then I also do trademarks

1146
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:14,400
and copyrights and we've also done trade

1147
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:16,730
secrets so that's a little bit by way of

1148
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,730
background
