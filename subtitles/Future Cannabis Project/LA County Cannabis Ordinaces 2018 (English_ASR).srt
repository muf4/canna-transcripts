2
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:16,640
Los Angeles County is by far the most

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:22,079
populous county in the entire nation and

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,330
that's being a factor in now cannabis

5
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,679
regulations and estates we're a third of

6
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,739
the population is just in this one

7
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,599
County it's something that is concerning

8
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:33,149
in general to make sure that we have

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,429
proper regulations going forward so that

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,079
it's something that can sync up with how

11
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:38,100
Northern California has been doing since

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,899
they've done well on putting their

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,870
regulations forward that Southern

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,929
California specifically Los Angeles does

15
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:48,718
it properly and in a way that would not

16
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:51,329
destabilize a regulated market within

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,739
Los Angeles what you have is you have a

18
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,649
population of about 10 million people

19
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:58,769
but it comes in through 89 different

20
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,149
jurisdictions and because state laws are

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,160
set up in a way that you have to have a

22
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,290
dual license to be a legal cannabis

23
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,810
operator obviously need to have one on

24
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,000
state but also your legal city so within

25
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,829
the County of Los Angeles the challenges

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,769
come in in that you could literally have

27
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:16,890
89 different sets of regulations for

28
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,478
people to operate legally my

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,890
organization and those have been

30
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,170
supporting this stuff to trying to get

31
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,579
the regulations done within the county

32
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,469
have been working on this for the past

33
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,828
two years now and a lot of progress has

34
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:30,420
really been made over the past year it's

35
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:31,889
an interesting contrast to look and see

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,750
because now we've hit this one-year

37
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,030
threshold or the second year in general

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,188
and you can look back and you can see

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,349
such a drastic contrast of how the

40
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:43,859
progress has been on the way so for

41
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:45,750
instance last year of February 2017 the

42
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,239
Board of Supervisors issued their first

43
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,759
motion towards exploring a regulated

44
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,828
cannabis market and it was a motion that

45
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,649
was very basic threw out a little bit of

46
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:57,089
Zoning what to kind of SPECT they staked

47
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,609
the flag in the ground at that time to

48
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,200
not allow for agricultural land to be

49
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:02,728
used which is a little silly considering

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,368
what the product is that we're dealing

51
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:07,618
with here it also becomes more

52
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:09,449
concerning because the vast majority of

53
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:12,360
the unincorporated areas within the

54
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,919
county are agricultural land some quick

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,360
statistics on that again

56
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,289
the unincorporated areas of the county

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,500
make up 65% of the entire landmass area

58
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:26,609
of LA County and within that about 40%

59
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,770
of that is agricultural land but they

60
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,989
put their first recommendations out

61
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,180
there to start exploring this but within

62
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,430
the same breath they also had one of the

63
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,980
supervisors had introduced a thought to

64
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,219
spend 25 million dollars to eradicate

65
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,840
all existing operators so it was a it

66
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,039
was a to face kind of thing it's like

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,629
let's look into this thing but let's

68
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,060
also get rid of the people which doesn't

69
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,250
really seem to jive with what the spirit

70
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,299
of props 64 is you know the intent is to

71
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,989
give these people a way of transition

72
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,819
exactly and that was in it's interesting

73
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,009
mention that because that was really the

74
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:01,048
ultimate goal the supervisors had stated

75
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:03,060
they said that there's a goal behind

76
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:06,030
this is to maximize a transition of an

77
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,129
illicit Reggae of an illicit market into

78
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,780
a regulated market so when they're

79
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:11,489
stating that the policies don't seem to

80
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,370
really support what their goal is on

81
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,780
that what you're looking at now and so a

82
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,219
year ago they wanted to spend that money

83
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,979
fast-forwarding a little bit we

84
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,389
certainly did a good job to fight back

85
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:23,429
against them spending that twenty five

86
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,669
million dollars so they did not have the

87
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,689
funds to come after the operators

88
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:28,979
because you know we just showed that it

89
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:30,989
did not seem to make sense for them to

90
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,819
do such a strict enforcement on them

91
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,620
prior to having real regulations in

92
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:39,689
there now you see

93
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:42,000
last week February now 2018 a year later

94
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:44,180
that the discussion is evolved with them

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,019
over time we've been able to host

96
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,120
expungement clinics and so on and so

97
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,120
forth that now the counties actually put

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,930
in a motion saying that they are

99
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,759
directing several different various

100
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,650
departments from the DEA to sheriff's

101
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,078
you name it to start coming together to

102
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,629
actually have a unified system that

103
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,310
could potentially just automatically

104
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:04,079
send out people who have previous

105
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,280
cannabis convictions and expungements

106
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,260
they would just get a letter in the mail

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,689
saying your record no longer exists and

108
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:11,159
that's incredible in contrast to think

109
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:12,659
that you know literally almost a year

110
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,189
ago to date they went from let's spend

111
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,810
25 million dollars to go after them to

112
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:18,120
now it's hey let's actually help them

113
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,639
out and get rid of this stuff on here so

114
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,439
LA County you know the the overall

115
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,569
discussion has evolved and they

116
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,918
understand the importance behind that

117
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,629
better than they certainly did a year

118
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,579
ago

119
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:30,810
doesn't though necessarily mean that

120
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:32,789
they understand everything that they are

121
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,500
is in there and so there's still plenty

122
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,230
of room to figure out what there is on

123
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,689
that one of the things that was achieved

124
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,220
last year is that the Board of

125
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:43,829
Supervisors through the Office of

126
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,510
cannabis management had set up a what

127
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:47,849
they call an advisory working group and

128
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:50,610
the Advisory working group was made up

129
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,860
of seventeen individuals with various

130
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,980
backgrounds from doctors on the academic

131
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,660
- you know literal medical doctors those

132
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,450
were pro cannabis and those were against

133
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,790
cannabis and the intent of it was to

134
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,860
have this group come together and write

135
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,600
a set of recommendations that the board

136
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,240
of supervisors would be basing their

137
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,600
recommended regulations for cannabis in

138
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,310
the county it was a very interesting

139
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,170
process it took several months with us

140
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,899
meeting weekly on that different topics

141
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,370
every time that we met you know to

142
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:24,359
mention on that you know I was part of

143
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:27,810
that process there if for a

144
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,490
recommendation to be made it had to have

145
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,920
reached consensus amongst all the

146
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,120
members within a committee so that meant

147
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,160
that those that were either for or

148
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,290
against it had to find language that

149
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,240
would be comfortable for both sides that

150
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,510
would ultimately promote a responsible

151
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,670
policy within the realm of regulations

152
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,629
here and it was interesting to see this

153
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,770
whole process coming forward on that

154
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:51,029
essentially what was two sides they've

155
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:53,639
come together to come up and make these

156
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:56,309
lists of regulations and coincidentally

157
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,719
we had 64 of them and I say

158
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,449
coincidentally because you know all this

159
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,710
passed with prop 64 and it certainly

160
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:03,719
wasn't you know our intent to do that

161
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:06,750
way but this list you know turned out to

162
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,490
be a 300 page reports that was meant to

163
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,899
guide the supervisors on saying okay

164
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,639
these are the next steps we take now

165
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,549
that we've done this this is how we want

166
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,099
to roll out regulations since that time

167
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,509
the Board of Supervisors have now had

168
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,720
you know that report was published in

169
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:23,909
October of 2017 and they've had now

170
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,130
several months to look at it study it

171
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,350
and consider it and they just recently

172
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:31,560
have now proposed their first draft

173
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,420
regulations and it's concerning to us in

174
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,149
general because they're their set of

175
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,250
regulations have come out and they

176
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:39,810
literally have 12 regulate 12

177
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,339
recommendations is what they're looking

178
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,430
at right now

179
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:45,289
is a 64 that we made and the discussions

180
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,000
that we have in there we're discovering

181
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,120
more and more while the topic is

182
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,279
certainly very multi-layered and complex

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,110
we're learning that they have not taken

184
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,089
perhaps the sincerest efforts needed to

185
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,610
study everything that we put out there

186
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:00,829
as well as other materials on them so

187
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,660
for instance there is a report that

188
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:05,209
comes in from the office of canvas

189
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,919
management that states that the current

190
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:09,769
market right now of the existing

191
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:12,198
operators is at a level of about 77 or

192
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:14,418
so so within the unincorporated areas

193
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,110
you have about 77 of these existing

194
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:19,819
retail operators they don't specify what

195
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,900
they're for delivery and they say that

196
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:22,610
it is in general they can't really

197
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,439
determine how many they have for all the

198
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,169
other types of from cultivation

199
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:29,180
manufacturing and so on but they have

200
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:30,589
this number out there and it contrasts

201
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,180
directly and they do point this out in

202
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:33,739
the report it contrasts directly the

203
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,569
recommendation that they've put out

204
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,788
there saying that they only want to

205
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:40,668
allow 20 retail licenses for the entire

206
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:43,879
county and that to us is an immediate

207
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:45,469
red flag because it sets up potentially

208
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,560
one of the largest illicit markets in

209
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:51,289
the largest county in the nation in

210
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,139
general and it's it's setting up people

211
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:55,788
to essentially be recriminate

212
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:58,430
on something that we're trying to give

213
00:07:55,788 --> 00:08:01,189
them a pathway out of you know what was

214
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,228
in the past thing my father and and it's

215
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,860
it's an odd contrast again because here

216
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:08,089
we are last week the board passing the

217
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,550
expungement directive to get that

218
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,560
automated and and it seems to fit in

219
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,360
line with the spirit of prop 64 was and

220
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,129
yet at the same time the policies are

221
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,538
now just showing it's like okay we want

222
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,490
to get this taken care of at the same

223
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:22,159
time the possible just would lead them

224
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:26,478
right back to being recriminate again so

225
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:31,370
just sticking on in this is retail

226
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:33,379
you're saying from their deduction they

227
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,690
believe they're about seventy-seven

228
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:39,769
operators but they want to have 20 which

229
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:41,870
implies that they want to shut down 57

230
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,978
of them well yeah and and you know it's

231
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,450
it's an interesting thing it's a

232
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,830
discussion we have so one of the

233
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,870
recommendations we made is that they

234
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,670
need to provide for a pathway for the

235
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,339
existing operators so the intent is to

236
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:54,149
try to get rid of the illicit market and

237
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,880
encourage responsible operators to come

238
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,949
a regulated market but at the same time

239
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,759
there is a the supervisors level there

240
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:04,259
is a two paths of this discussion one is

241
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,120
what do we do about existing operators

242
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:07,679
and the other one is how large should

243
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,289
the market be and they're not

244
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,029
necessarily the same thing so we're

245
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:13,860
trying to showcase them saying that your

246
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:16,169
own report states that the market is at

247
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,480
least 77 operators big and that's

248
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:20,129
strictly on the medical side you know so

249
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,250
we don't know what the adult use side

250
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:24,809
could certainly grow that on there and

251
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,039
and and where that's illicit market

252
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:27,329
certainly comes in from that stuff is

253
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:29,339
because like you mentioned on that

254
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,509
that's if you're gonna just look at

255
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,889
those and they could transition let's

256
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:33,689
say no one else applies on that that's

257
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,549
immediately 50 some odd operators that

258
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,620
you know become illicit or have to stay

259
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,729
illicit it's not like something magical

260
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,779
that they're just gonna say we're gonna

261
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:45,690
figure out another way to feed our

262
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:49,799
families say as long as each of these

263
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:53,730
operators meets whatever the criteria is

264
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:55,679
for receiving a permit or retail that if

265
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,810
they go through that process each of

266
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,839
them could make the transition that's in

267
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:03,569
it is partly on that end what it comes

268
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,060
down to is now timing issue so the board

269
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:09,060
had originally intended to address this

270
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:11,189
on December 19th of 2017 and here we are

271
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,329
now pushing almost into March and it

272
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,520
will likely be March before they see

273
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,230
this issue for the first time it could

274
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,370
be longer than that so what was

275
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,320
originally intended that they would

276
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,299
start accepting license applications in

277
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,010
June of 2018

278
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:25,529
it seems like it will probably towards

279
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:28,200
the later end of 2018 maybe even early

280
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:29,759
2019 the applications start so what do

281
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,470
we do in the meantime of nearly a year

282
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,639
where you still have an illicit market

283
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,290
with operators are there that are

284
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,179
waiting to transition they would do it

285
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:46,019
yesterday gladly if the system was set

286
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:47,759
up they have they have I mean it's very

287
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,399
hard for them to understand what is the

288
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,100
best way to go forward on this by the

289
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,129
letterer law they it's been confusing so

290
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,440
prior to 2018 you could have operators

291
00:10:56,129 --> 00:11:00,929
were technically States compliant under

292
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,490
prop 215 laws but locally they were not

293
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:06,299
compliant because the county had just

294
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,528
bandits now after the passing of 2018 in

295
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,929
our legal cannabis Mart

296
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:11,698
it it becomes more murky as to what that

297
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:13,318
gray area is yes we still have this

298
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:15,149
collective model that is recognized by

299
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:17,370
safe for the year but it really still

300
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:18,688
defaults by local law as to that's

301
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,999
something they can operate on my mom

302
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:22,919
so with these operators here they're

303
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:25,019
their intent and their desires obviously

304
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,058
come into this regulated market but with

305
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,249
no pathway they're existing for them the

306
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:31,049
only opportunity they have or thought

307
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:32,790
that they have is either to shut down

308
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:34,078
which is not an easy thing to do when

309
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:37,230
you have families to feed and not just

310
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:39,120
theirs but employees and so on or or to

311
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,860
continue operating with the threat of

312
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,509
potentially getting enforced against

313
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,800
we've seen that their intent is to

314
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:46,438
regulate and they want to have a

315
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,719
regulated market where we have concerns

316
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:50,188
as how quickly they do so the advantage

317
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,540
of them taking a little slower approach

318
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:53,730
on this is that they get to learn from

319
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:55,438
the mistakes of other jurisdictions so

320
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,819
city or light for instance has certain

321
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:58,259
things that they had perhaps

322
00:11:56,818 --> 00:11:59,248
opportunities to do better on this is

323
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,409
where the county will hopefully not

324
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:02,699
repeat those same mistakes that doesn't

325
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:04,078
mean that they won't invent and create

326
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:06,929
their own mistakes as well - in the

327
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:09,359
process so the timing is what the issue

328
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:10,828
is coming down to on that and when we

329
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,688
have our discussions with the board on

330
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:14,878
that we know with their staff it's

331
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:16,409
concerning to us - where we bring up

332
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,938
saying hey here's this limit of 20

333
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:20,100
that's being recommended and we're

334
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:21,539
talking about the 77 to 77 that's in

335
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,670
their own report that came from the

336
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:24,599
county doing this and their response

337
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:27,419
list is saying where'd you get this

338
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,490
number 77 so you know when they're not

339
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,750
having the time needed I guess or

340
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,278
whatever they're not dedicating that to

341
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,649
to actually read their own reports and

342
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,360
study them to contrast and see what is

343
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:39,509
the right policy that's very much a

344
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,370
concern however you know we we

345
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,688
appreciate that they want to do the slow

346
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,068
rollout because they want to be

347
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:47,039
responsible and thoughtful on how they

348
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:48,750
do it the slow roll off cannot be done

349
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,639
in such a way that it just hurts people

350
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,870
in the process as well - so I know that

351
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,308
they want to do it slower so they can

352
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,870
kind of protect and have public you know

353
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:56,879
safety and health and me know involved

354
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,139
in all this but if it just hurts other

355
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,730
people that have been doing something

356
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,379
for I ever feeding their families and

357
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,289
they have no other way to go that's not

358
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,850
gonna work by there but you know like

359
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:06,748
you know the thing the other aspect of

360
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,740
all this stuff that's concerning is

361
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:09,899
let's say that they were just gonna

362
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,278
start with the 20 we would be okay with

363
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,539
that because they want to do a rollout

364
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,220
on that we'd be ok with that if there

365
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:16,169
was a reasonable time rate for the

366
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,819
rollouts their recommended time rate

367
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:19,198
right now is three years so essentially

368
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:21,179
they're saying we would give only 20

369
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,549
licenses for a population that is

370
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:26,759
equal to the fourth-largest city in the

371
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:28,109
state and that those 30 20 licenses

372
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,370
would only be there for the next three

373
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,669
years and at that point we'll reevaluate

374
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,830
and see where it goes it would issue the

375
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:37,829
20 licenses quickly but then they put a

376
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,580
moratorium on additional licenses for at

377
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,620
least three years

378
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,360
correct correct and and it's

379
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,810
disingenuous because these zoning that

380
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,120
they're currently proposing on that many

381
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:49,139
of the larger swaths of land that they

382
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,879
want to absolutely have no

383
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,379
infrastructure in them and all so

384
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,429
there's no sewage no power no anything

385
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,139
to go with that by time you get

386
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:56,549
permitting anything on that it could

387
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,500
likely take up to three years for an

388
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:00,149
operate to actually be up and running so

389
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,679
all the money all the funds that goes in

390
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,389
there that does nothing to go back to

391
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,459
their primary goal of transitioning this

392
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:06,929
market there's nothing gonna be there

393
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,060
these guys are gonna have to eat list it

394
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,229
running and illicit our market for that

395
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:20,048
to survive in one chain

396
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:20,048
