1
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,560
let folks know that their that this

2
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:24,189
place exists you know the two three

3
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,960
gosh it's 2019 now four years ago on the

4
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:28,240
floor of the assembly the assembly

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,099
member for the North Coast said to hit

6
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,219
the rest of his colleagues like hey you

7
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:35,799
guys there is no weed fairy every gram

8
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:37,210
consumed in every community comes from a

9
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,469
farmer and a lot of them are in my

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,600
district and a lot of them are in

11
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:42,070
Brian's district Brian you know being

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,559
the guy who represents just north of

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,329
here who may be your next state senator

14
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,728
but like there isn't a weed fairy and

15
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,719
people just have never really like water

16
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:51,429
comes from the tap

17
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,859
cannabis comes from the DEA the hustler

18
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:55,268
like that's all there ever was and so we

19
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:57,908
need to start breaking down that

20
00:00:55,268 --> 00:01:00,219
paradigm in general but I think giving

21
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:02,228
people a win showing them that door is

22
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:04,329
it's a gateway it's a gateway into a

23
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:10,329
whole greater way of being an awareness

24
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:11,890
and just show them the gate I would just

25
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:13,688
add that here locally Grass Valley

26
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,728
growers has only begin to scratch the

27
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:17,500
surface in telling the story and the

28
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:21,549
culture and heritage of this place and

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,469
the people that made it happen going

30
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:25,269
into the future I really look forward to

31
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:30,370
being able to involve more people to

32
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:32,979
tell that story you know it's

33
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,719
interesting there's a lot of

34
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,200
similarities in the small farms and so

35
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,700
how do you articulate what makes each

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,230
one special and I think there's a few

37
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,280
different ways to do it from you know

38
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:47,800
location and terroir and history and

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,780
then also for me it's it's you know from

40
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,539
a personal perspective like that that

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,030
concept of the the ethos of homesteading

42
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,210
which you know I draw a really clear

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,879
difference in in cannabis reality

44
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:04,689
between homesteading and resource

45
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:07,420
extraction and we've seen both paradigms

46
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:09,250
you know and and so for me it's very

47
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,110
important to be able to articulate the

48
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,479
reality of the homestead or the food

49
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,209
production the fruit trees the chickens

50
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:18,250
the weed all of the different facets and

51
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:23,469
and to try to communicate that in a way

52
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:24,639
that that connects and you know asked me

53
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:26,818
in five years and I'll tell you how it

54
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,818
goes

55
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,659
Casey I'm really glad you used the W

56
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:39,090
word so I've seen a lot of change in our

57
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:42,039
culture since we'd became cannabis since

58
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:45,580
everybody talks about ganja as cannabis

59
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:48,519
and and everything has as shifted you

60
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,560
know for better for worse what do you

61
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,350
see as far as the cultural perspective

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,030
of how you you are working with these

63
00:02:53,349 --> 00:03:01,060
changes as we has become cannabis and

64
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,039
people are looking at a different thing

65
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,420
because there's there's honestly you

66
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,340
know again for better for worse there's

67
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:07,899
a bit of a gentrification happening in

68
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,620
the coal in the cannabis culture right

69
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,420
now and you know on a lot of levels you

70
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,189
know gentrification is nice you know I

71
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:17,169
like to eat out at nice places and this

72
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:19,000
and that but I also have to be aware of

73
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:21,250
what's happening in order to create

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,629
those conveniences you know it's it's

75
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,620
really interesting there's a lot to

76
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:29,709
unpack there this idea of you know words

77
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:34,299
have power and the words we choose to

78
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,500
use convey a lot of things and so in the

79
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:38,980
process you know it's kind of this

80
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,780
iterative process in which early on you

81
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:42,518
know the the newspapers it's the pot

82
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,500
growers did a bit a bit a bit of it and

83
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,719
in the legislature it's like so you're

84
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,909
here to talk about marijuana and they

85
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,500
can't even say it at full volume and so

86
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:53,590
you know that transition from marijuana

87
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:57,549
to cannabis was was very important

88
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:59,829
because it was it was a taking of an an

89
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:02,230
ownership of the process and the

90
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:03,820
terminology and and we said every step

91
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:06,069
of the way like look right now we're

92
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,419
we're working to support the process of

93
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,709
creating regulations as soon as

94
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,609
regulations exist we're gonna be like

95
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,140
any other industry we're gonna be

96
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,510
fighting about the regulations and so

97
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:16,168
that's really where we are now is that

98
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:18,939
it has come to that point where now

99
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,529
we're not asking for something we're

100
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:22,779
trying to push back against something

101
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,459
and and so you know I don't necessarily

102
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:26,349
have an answer to like what the

103
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:28,120
appropriate terminology is yet because

104
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,750
we're all still iterating it but it's

105
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,370
it's definitely the the transition has

106
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,990
happened and now we're trying to figure

107
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,620
out you know essentially how to pick up

108
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:42,769
the pieces I think that when when Nixon

109
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,899
Claire Dewar on the anti-war left and

110
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:47,209
people of color with the intention of

111
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:49,099
disrupting communities incarcerated

112
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:52,339
leaders that there was more going on

113
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,500
there I think that stoners which I'm no

114
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:56,779
longer ashamed to be I struggled with it

115
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,610
a lot growing up but I am a sodor and I

116
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,619
do like to smoke weed and that's just

117
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,900
what it is and we're actually the

118
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,579
majority and our communities have been

119
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:06,888
intentionally and systematically

120
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:09,319
disrupted for many many many many years

121
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,960
now since I think that was the 68

122
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:14,719
election that that conversation was

123
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:18,198
actually had and so to me I would never

124
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,850
call it weed if I were advocating you

125
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,889
know when we went to the legislature it

126
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,900
was cannabis that was the accurate term

127
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,819
that was the correct term but I don't

128
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:27,739
use other slang words when I talked to

129
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:30,139
Senators either right it's it's there's

130
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,019
a time in a place and so to me pivoting

131
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:35,750
into cannabis as a term for the purpose

132
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:38,329
of advocacy was the absolute correct

133
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,279
decision it gave us the ability to have

134
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:42,649
a conversation without all of the

135
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:45,049
triggers and the stereotypes but I tell

136
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:47,689
you what I am a stoner and I like to

137
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:50,449
smoke good weed and I will never change

138
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:53,870
that that is what I am and so are all of

139
00:05:50,449 --> 00:06:01,250
you and so are most of them and it's

140
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:03,530
cool yeah and the heart of weed that

141
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:12,259
just didn't really flow as much as the

142
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:14,179
heart of cannabis you know thw like the

143
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,098
throwback right like I do a radio show

144
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,418
and I called the farm and reefer report

145
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:18,740
because that's what like my dad when I

146
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,649
was a kid he was always like that it was

147
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,269
reefer and so you know the different you

148
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,709
know the different iterations over time

149
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:26,839
is something that I think like we really

150
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:28,939
you know we really hold on to and and

151
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,649
and do honor unto and then there's an

152
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:32,660
even older generation that referred to

153
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:34,638
refrigerators as reefers and it almost

154
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,650
got us in trouble once when our landlord

155
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,500
got us a new refrigerator in college and

156
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:42,620
stopped by to see the new reefer well he

157
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,209
walks in and he says he says I'm here to

158
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,658
see the I'm here to check out the reefer

159
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:49,579
and and I'm just like and I'm kind of

160
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,800
like I'm like well I guess off with the

161
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,389
bay we

162
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,400
and my other roommate is like the new

163
00:06:52,389 --> 00:07:00,490
fridge is excellent Dave we're really

164
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:03,658
and I'm the old that's what's going well

165
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:07,569
bring it bringing it back to the coop so

166
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:10,870
Daniel what what do you see what are you

167
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:14,020
looking for in a farm when somebody is

168
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:16,418
interested in joining your coop and what

169
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:20,918
if what do you as a coop offer to the

170
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:23,948
farmer well first of all I don't think

171
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:27,008
of it as my coop it is our co-op and

172
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:29,319
whoever takes part in it has ownership

173
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:33,788
and control in that cooperative just the

174
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:35,650
same as everybody else me personally as

175
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:36,939
a farmer I'm a polyculture farmer I like

176
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:40,750
to bear fruits and vegetables right

177
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:43,120
alongside my cannabis as well so on a

178
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,418
personal level I would like to see more

179
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,569
farms of that variety come into the

180
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:51,250
group but I would not expect everybody

181
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:54,598
to jump on board with something like

182
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,439
that it's more of an attitude of

183
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,740
cooperation like these guys have

184
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,598
mentioned before there are lots of

185
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,949
standards and regulations put down on us

186
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,899
from above

187
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,520
whether it be category 3 testing

188
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:09,399
determining that we're completely free

189
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,839
of pesticides or anyone that can get

190
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,149
through the piles of paperwork we have

191
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,399
to do probably has a decent level of

192
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:18,068
competency anybody that's actually

193
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,348
achieved full compliance is likely a

194
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:24,000
good member of a cooperative if they

195
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:27,699
have the attitude of cooperation it

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,860
there's a there's a certain level of

197
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:31,509
selflessness I think required to go into

198
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,209
it because we are working for a greater

199
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:36,908
good I know I've put countless hours

200
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:40,629
into this since I first started working

201
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:43,299
towards cooperatives and yes it is to

202
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:46,088
see my own farm succeed but without

203
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:48,219
seeing other local farmers succeed I'm

204
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:51,459
in a failed community and I don't want

205
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,709
to live in a failed community word yeah

206
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:55,569
big up and that's you know I think

207
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,189
that's a commonality here that drove all

208
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,839
of us into the the regulatory process

209
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,180
the dialogue around regulatory

210
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,000
development was seeing the community

211
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:06,309
survive the community thrive

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,990
and one of the things I think that's

213
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:10,209
really important there's a lot of

214
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,200
resources on mo groan comm there's a

215
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:15,070
cooperative how to develop a cooperative

216
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,560
presentation that's that's really

217
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,270
helpful it's you're starting a business

218
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:20,579
with other people right and so you've

219
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:22,720
got a bunch of partners you're all

220
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,730
owning and running this business and

221
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,200
it's really really important to figure

222
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,509
out what your foundation is and where

223
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,070
you're going with it because it's really

224
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:32,110
easy not to have because those

225
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,270
conversations can be difficult and too

226
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,529
if you don't really drill down into it

227
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,179
and nail down what it is you're trying

228
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:38,799
to do you can get a couple years into it

229
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:40,419
and have a whole lot of different you

230
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,069
know we got two years into emerald

231
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:43,479
growing and like some people wanted it

232
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,530
to be a distribution cooperative some

233
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,970
people want it to be a marketing

234
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,519
cooperative some people wanted to just

235
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:52,149
wanted to sell the weed and and so it

236
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,769
you know it's it can be it's it's really

237
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,409
important to nail that down and so from

238
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:58,299
a personal perspective like we're we

239
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:59,889
started right now it is very very small

240
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:01,000
we hope once we sort of nail it down

241
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:03,580
some that will make it a little bigger

242
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,470
but there's two farm families involved

243
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,360
habitat farms and emerald spear

244
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,370
botanicals we call happy happy spirit

245
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,889
cooperative and and the goal is to have

246
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,750
a cooperative based around diversified

247
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:15,789
production that you know farms who are

248
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,850
also engaged in market gardening for

249
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:20,799
farmers markets and CSA food production

250
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,019
and cannabis because one of the things

251
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,569
that I found was like from my

252
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:27,730
perspective and what I'm doing is is

253
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:32,650
different than a you know for instance a

254
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:34,750
rapid rotation multi light depth of

255
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:38,169
rapid rotation greenhouse operation and

256
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,909
so for me as as a single season outdoor

257
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:41,979
farmer with a lot of food production and

258
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:45,429
farmers markets like I've got a really

259
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,500
specific reality and so I want to build

260
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:49,449
a cooperative that is that is based

261
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,669
around that specific reality and so I

262
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,110
think it's really important to like and

263
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:54,849
and the presentation goes through this

264
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,470
but there's a there's a personal values

265
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,149
worksheet and like you know we

266
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,350
acknowledge the collective I role of

267
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,329
like cool I'm gonna write down my

268
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,639
personal values but actually like it's

269
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,870
it's really cool like you you come out

270
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,429
of this thing with like well I've really

271
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,320
articulated for myself something that I

272
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,819
think is very important and then I can

273
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,879
take that forward into this business

274
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,440
project and and we can nail down what it

275
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,000
is we're trying to do and we can figure

276
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,990
out if it's a good fit cuz like I say

277
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,250
this is a this is a

278
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,200
partnership you're going into business

279
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,809
together and so it's not something to be

280
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,330
taken lightly and it's really important

281
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:27,549
to really like solidify that foundation

282
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:33,040
and I just want to speak briefly to

283
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:35,588
tangible benefits to to joining a member

284
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,769
co-op of Emerald grown which Grass

285
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:41,709
Valley growers is you know this year

286
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:43,208
we're focusing on a few key things over

287
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,699
the next five years we want to reduce

288
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:47,769
production costs increase margin to

289
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,480
Farmer and provide you know a broad

290
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:51,069
range of price to consumers it's gonna

291
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,899
take a lot to be able to channel

292
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:56,500
products in a way that we can achieve

293
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:59,350
those goals so in 2019 participating

294
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,778
farms that is members of a member co-op

295
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,889
because we're a co-op of coops so you

296
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:04,899
know locally joining Grass Valley

297
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,059
growers or forming a new co-op and

298
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,830
joining emerald grown we have an

299
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,199
inventory management platform that

300
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:14,259
Salesforce based and metric integrated

301
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,959
it's the best in market we provide that

302
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:18,580
to farmers at no upfront cost this is so

303
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,369
all the things I'm about to describe are

304
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,839
how we're structuring the house brand so

305
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,578
we give you the clones to grow for the

306
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,050
house brand first and foremost that way

307
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,399
each and every person is growing the

308
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:29,559
same clones so at the end of the day

309
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,078
we've got a relatively consistent large

310
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:34,809
batch so you get a handful of clones you

311
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,789
get an inventory management software you

312
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:38,739
get a compliance oversight and audit

313
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,719
software that our compliance team can

314
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,789
help use to audit you to keep you on

315
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,269
track with permits help support your

316
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:47,799
licensing efforts and we have a

317
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:49,720
collective marketing you know we've

318
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,458
contracted with an agency that again too

319
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,379
expensive for any of us to have on our

320
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:56,799
own but collectively we can afford them

321
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:59,939
very powerful marketing agency so you

322
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:02,528
know participating in that brand program

323
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,089
and then you know the big thing that

324
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:05,799
we're working on is is building out a

325
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:07,170
handful of aggregation centers around

326
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,889
the state we we basically

327
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:10,689
cross-referenced where there's a lot of

328
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:12,549
growers in the pipeline and where there

329
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,829
aren't a lot of support facilities this

330
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:16,509
is one of those communities I was hoping

331
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:18,729
to be able to announce the location

332
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:20,019
today but we had lawyers and they did

333
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,539
the lawyer thing on the phone together

334
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:24,429
and we're gonna do some more changes to

335
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:26,769
the thing before I can sign it but

336
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:28,299
Nevada County will be one of you know

337
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:29,740
Nevada County Mendocino County in

338
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:30,609
Humboldt County are the three counties

339
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,860
that we'd like to

340
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,989
to put these centers in first and so you

341
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,058
know as a part owner of an aggregation

342
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:38,798
processing facility a lot of the

343
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:40,600
traditional farm operations are being

344
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:42,698
disrupted you can't dry you can't trim

345
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,920
you can't do whatever our goal is not to

346
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,748
prescribe to anyone what they do with

347
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,849
our Center but for it to be there to

348
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:50,709
pick up the pieces wherever their their

349
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,778
process gets disrupted whether they know

350
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,878
it now whether they learn about it in

351
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:57,999
October when it starts raining to have a

352
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:00,428
solution avoid waste efficiency that is

353
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:02,678
our number-one goal this year is to not

354
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:04,899
waste a single dollar not waste a single

355
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:07,328
drop not let a single gram go to waste

356
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,970
so inventory management software

357
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:12,248
compliance support oversight a unified

358
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,959
marketing program and and you know

359
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:15,548
hopefully by the new year will have

360
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:19,258
these centers online to be able to

361
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:19,259
provide more tangible supply seen

362
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,679
you
