our community here in Mendocino County

43
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,519
it is a large subdivision it's a rural

44
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:54,129
residential area that's zoned for

45
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,228
agriculture and there's smaller parcels

46
00:01:54,129 --> 00:01:58,000
and so they're more affordable and so

47
00:01:56,228 --> 00:02:01,239
historically over the decades it's been

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,099

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,680
of these incubator area

58
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,539
to the economic development of rural

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,000
producing areas like Mendocino County

60
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:32,829
thank you want to give a special thanks

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,479
to Meadowlands they have been really

62
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,950
really supportive of getting our local

63
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,568
community out here and getting the

64
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:38,919
members of our trade associations

65
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:40,119
present and really want to thank you

66
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:47,649

67
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:49,598
beautiful event thank you so much so

68
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,150
we're gonna do a series of introductions

69
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:54,009
and then we have a couple of discussion

70
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,159
topics then we'll open it up for Q&amp;A at

71
00:02:54,009 --> 00:03:00,250
the end I want to talk a little bit

72
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,340
about Geographic indication systems and

73
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,318
offer an overview for the for the panel

74
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,379
so Geographic indication systems are a

75
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:10,719
category of intellectual property rights

76
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:13,689
they collectively belong to the region

77
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,699
that's tied to producing and special

78
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:18,370
practices and the product of the region

79
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:20,949
an appellation of origin is a special

80
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,230
kind of geographic indication that's got

81
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:26,439
standards associated with it that really

82
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:28,750
codify and protect the practices the

83
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:32,409
heritage and the special genetics of the

84
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:35,530
region and in California we've got a few

85
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:37,560
tools now in state law we've got county

86
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,049
of origin which is a general geographic

87
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:45,549
indication it's tied to our counties and

88
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:48,430
then in 2017 the industry lobbied and

89
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:51,819
really advocated to get appellation of

90
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,250
origin in California statute with the

91
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:56,500
very special associated standards

92
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,799
practices and cultivars tied to it and

93
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,229
so right now we've got those two tools

94
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,510
in in law and the California Department

95
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:07,798
of food and egg will be taking petitions

96
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:09,909
for appellation of origin in 2021 and

97
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,579
right now they're working to develop

98
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:14,349
their regulations to support the program

99
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:18,310
so we're excited to see this moving

100
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:20,918
forward the Mendocino little hand yeah

101
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,569
shout out to Cal cannabis for working on

102
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,069
cannabis appellations they're putting a

103
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:26,259
lot of resources to it and I think

104
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:27,879
that's a really significant thing for us

105
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:30,759
at this time it's going to be a really

106
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,408
important tool for us moving forward so

107
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,430
the Mendocino Appalachians project is

108
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:37,800
part of a coalition of regional trade

109
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,540
that are working together to realize

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,800
this tremendous opportunity for

111
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,330
standards-based legally recognized

112
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,530
nationally and internationally

113
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:48,449
recognized appellation of origin

114
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:50,879
protections and we're doing this from

115
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,949
the basis of rural economic development

116
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,659
and really thinking about sustainability

117
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,159
when it comes to our rural economic

118
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,950
development because this is happening

119
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,870
fast there's a tsunami upon us and it's

120
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,909
very important that as we build policy

121
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,980
in a market that we think about rural

122
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,110
economic development and doing doing so

123
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,759
in a way that's sustainable so that's a

124
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,050
little bit about what I'm working on and

125
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,939
the overall topic that we're going to be

126
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,009
addressing around genetic resources and

127
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:15,029
I'm gonna go ahead and pass this on

128
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,589
so the panelists can introduce

129
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:21,029
themselves and tell us a little bit

130
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:23,909
about what y'all are working on the

131
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:27,539
first time I out the world tell well

132
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:31,040
here in in California was with Tim Blake

133
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,930
and Leo's turn from aficionado and

134
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,980
because I'm France and it's part of my

135
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:40,350
culture it resonated really strong and I

136
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,290
started to study it because I spa as

137
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:47,430
much as it's part of my culture I didn't

138
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:50,600
really know very much about it for a

139
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,459
scene in Europe every agricultural

140
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,360
projects that as a certain biggest

141
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:59,779
achieve aspect is evaluated see here's

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,189
the origin of the place and the world

143
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:05,219
literally the world country of France

144
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:07,829
it's based on Jew stoned out of

145
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,760
Appalachia and origin and appellation

146
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:17,449
d'origine of quality that give the

147
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:20,629
maximum protection for summer and

148
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:24,089
protection internationally and bring

149
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:27,899
your the name of that little farm in the

150
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:32,129
middle of nowhere to a world to the

151
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:36,959
world view and every stone downs that

152
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:41,250
are made are dedicated solely to create

153
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:45,109
that quality and get greater than that

154
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:47,550
so the world Appalachian the region its

155
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,900
internationally protected you have to

156
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,810
follow set

157
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:54,689
then stand out to the later that have

158
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,478
been given from by France so you have

159
00:06:54,689 --> 00:07:00,660
the choice here in California

160
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:03,870
all you do like the American wine and

161
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,210
you create your own classification for

162
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,668
cannabis and you have to make it so good

163
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:12,329
that the rest of the world when they

164
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:14,459
legalize they want to follow your song

165
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:17,399
down and your regulation and your

166
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:22,109
classification because it's it like they

167
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:26,759
did for the for the wine oh you follow

168
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:28,319
the the appellation d'origine stand out

169
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,709
the wine and just he didn't do it

170
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,569
because they needed to create their wine

171
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:36,448
and Eustace they needed to have no

172
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:39,659
limitation so that they could create the

173
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:41,580
amazing wine that you have today you

174
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,430
don't have that problem you have so much

175
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,430
diversity so much quality so much

176
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:53,629
microclimate that you need literally to

177
00:07:54,288 --> 00:08:03,120
define it and and classify it because

178
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:08,069
it's solely age so you need basically

179
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:11,370
zhuzh limitation to to understand what

180
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:14,279
you have my world war heat all that time

181
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:17,699
was how can we prove that the reader can

182
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:20,759
I be stay well actually and during my

183
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,800
study in there is a French government

184
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,800
websites that tell you everything you

185
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,629
need to know about appellation delusion

186
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,509
and control your lotteries in English

187
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:33,838
and they made me realize that actually

188
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:36,599
even Bordeaux was recognized as a

189
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,120
terroir because the wine coming from

190
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,479
Bordeaux well recognized worldwide for

191
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,879
their quality so you don't have to prove

192
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,850
that you have a cannabis taehwa the

193
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:51,600
world over know that you're going the

194
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:54,330
best quality now you need to define the

195
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,709
terroir and defining the terroir goes

196
00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:02,278
beyond defining a region if you go the

197
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:05,369
so-so quality cultiva in Bordeaux it

198
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:09,149
not get an Appalachian Division if you

199
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:13,589
go the Gators quality of cultiva but in

200
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:15,659
the wrong part of Bordeaux it's not

201
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:19,069
considered an Appalachian the reason

202
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:20,308
it's not everywhere in Bordeaux that is

203
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:22,498
terroir

204
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:28,828
it's certain parts that are terroir so

205
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:32,308
the the our problems are labels that you

206
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:36,778
have it's to define all those amazing

207
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:39,480
tell ones that you have and then it's

208
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:43,350
like every agricultural product it's

209
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,149
like it's like wine except that in a

210
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,240
wine and you see they have twenty

211
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:51,448
surgical Chiva you have thousand of them

212
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,600
and it makes seems more complicated but

213
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:57,058
it makes you so much richer in the

214
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,089
amount of step and what you can bring on

215
00:09:57,058 --> 00:10:03,360
the table and on top of that every one

216
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:06,209
of your farm when you work with living

217
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,850
soul and you really use the world

218
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:11,729
beneficial life force of you of where

219
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,829
you go is gonna make your body different

220
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,199
and the neighbor then you can go even

221
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:20,308
deeper you are recognized for that

222
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:22,528
uniqueness of yes that specific genetics

223
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:24,990
that is poor gone on your farm and

224
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:28,500
that's that the name of the game is like

225
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:31,500
I've lived in many producing country

226
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,490
what you have here it's amazing and you

227
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:42,688
don't know how much how much you are

228
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:43,948
worth basically hey everyone yeah so

229
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:45,539
first of all you know I really

230
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:47,698
appreciate being invited to speak on

231
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,708
this panel it's kind of an honor I've

232
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:50,909
done some public speaking but none this

233
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,250
is kind of like the white collar

234
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:55,620
cannabis event and so you know I'm kind

235
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,149
of coming in and representing people

236
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,970
work with the plants the growing

237
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,740
community small craft farmers from the

238
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,600
Emerald triangle and people who are

239
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,209
really dedicating their their lives to

240
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,490
breeding work a little slow recovering

241
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:10,138
this morning but so let's talk about and

242
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,028
touch on some of the things that Frenchy

243
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,039
was talking about which is what is the

244
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:15,669
purpose in the origin of these

245
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,889
Appalachians and in

246
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:20,349
where they came from is really the small

247
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:21,519
craft farmer so in Romania and France in

248
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,620
certain regions where they were

249
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,899
producing a wine or a varietal of grape

250
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,970
that was famous and was starting to make

251
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,919
their names famous and then all the

252
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,870
sudden larger producers started saying I

253
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,089
want to get in on that I want to produce

254
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,919
that Pinot Noir I want to produce what

255
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,710
this little microclimate in Romania is

256
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,779
doing I want to produce champagne and

257
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,519
those small communities that were not

258
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:44,919
rich wealthy farmers they were small

259
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,259
family-run businesses said how can we

260
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:49,719
possibly compete against these massive

261
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:51,939
scale operations that can just demolish

262
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,769
us in in terms of efficiency and cost of

263
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,930
production and so you know this goes

264
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:57,850
back what he probably knows more of the

265
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:58,809
history but 100 150 years they worked

266
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,750
with their governments to establish

267
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:03,699
themselves and say look we started this

268
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,190
we are the originators of this the

269
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,770
process of how we grow these grapes and

270
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,020
what's in our unique atmosphere and

271
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:13,629
microclimate and our soils this is

272
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:16,240
champagne you can't get anything like

273
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:18,009
this you can replicate it but it'll

274
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,529
never be the same and that has to have

275
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:23,169
some intrinsic value of being an

276
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:26,049
originator and putting in decades and

277
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:28,750
decades of work so in California

278
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:30,099
Northern California especially I grew up

279
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,320
on the East Coast and I was an indoor

280
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,639
grower and you know I loved smoking

281
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,100
outdoor weed because of the unique

282
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,899
terpenes but you know there's there's

283
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,159
really no comparison when I came out my

284
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,870
first season in Humboldt

285
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,579
I was still iffy I'm like yeah this is

286
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,529
amazing but I kind of wish we had some

287
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,290
lights you know to show you kind of what

288
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:48,819
I can do after that first season my life

289
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:51,639
was changed I was completely blown away

290
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,920
about what the environment can actually

291
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,110
do the intensity of the Sun the the

292
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,599
balances and the coastal versus inland

293
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,460
micro climates the elevation and it was

294
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,980
really life changing just seeing how

295
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,960
incredible and how diverse cannabis can

296
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,240
be at all these spectrums because of

297
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,860
these unique areas and then over the

298
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,779
years as I started traveling and doing

299
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,730
consulting work or meeting different

300
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:14,769
farms I've been able to see genetics

301
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,779
similar and unique grown in all these

302
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:18,490
different areas so Humboldt County alone

303
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,919
is the size of a lot of small states

304
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,840
so just in southern Humboldt alone you

305
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,179
know the east or west side of the 101

306
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,769
represents a dozen or so little

307
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,779
microclimate some of them are more

308
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:29,439
coastal some of them are closer to the

309
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:31,329
redwoods and

310
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,860
just above a temperate rainforest some

311
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,350
of them go way too far out and they're

312
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,029
dry but you can see and taste the

313
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,740
difference in the flavors and terpenes

314
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:40,419
and resin production between all those

315
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,549
different regions and same with

316
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:44,169
Mendocino and I think that I have a

317
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:46,209
pretty good palate I smoke a lot and

318
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:48,399
I've seen herb produce and so there's

319
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,080
unique things to say about what are some

320
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,549
of the textures that resonate to me that

321
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,620
are similar whenever I see herb from

322
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:55,750
Bell Springs versus island mountain

323
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,899
versus Layton Villas comp Shi versus

324
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,429
burnt ranch and the deal is it's it's

325
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:01,899
really something unique and in

326
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:03,849
California right now everybody is

327
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:05,529
competing over this market share which

328
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,779
is eventually going to be really big for

329
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:10,000
California but the reality is that

330
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,829
California cannabis has something really

331
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,080
amazing to offer the entire world that's

332
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:17,620
that's the value California originates

333
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,389
culture you know besides you know San

334
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,009
Francisco and tech but we have Southern

335
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:23,559
California where I've only ventured to a

336
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:25,689
few times there's 20 million consumers

337
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,519
down there and those types of people

338
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,770
they need education about this so what's

339
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,149
happening is a lot of people want to get

340
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,069
in and they want to make money because

341
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:34,480
they think that cannabis is going to be

342
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,460
a business where they can just get in

343
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,440
and make money but there's folks who

344
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,960
preserved the way by taking a lot of

345
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,510
substantial risk and devotion and

346
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,660
determination for years and appellations

347
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:48,580
of origin is a way to potentially

348
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:50,529
protect and preserve the way of life for

349
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,540
those folks what's happening is there's

350
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:54,759
massive scale commercial production in

351
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:56,349
Southern California huge and there's

352
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,569
some really nice micro climates there's

353
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,000
green belts in Santa Barbara where they

354
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,670
grow certain varietals of wine so I

355
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,960
think that the balance for Appalachians

356
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,599
in Northern California is really

357
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,490
establishing not just the microclimates

358
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,290
and the difference in between what

359
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,089
varietal grows best in what area are

360
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:15,610
what farm grows him and for what reasons

361
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:17,920
but also the stories behind those

362
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,720
regions because just like in champagne

363
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,490
you know I have an associate of mine who

364
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,800
has an artisanal wine imports business

365
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,839
so two months ago he was in Champagne

366
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,399
met with small farmers and was able to

367
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,650
tour these facilities where they've been

368
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,480
passed down for multiple generations and

369
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,970
these are not wealthy people they live

370
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,399
in small houses they work their own you

371
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:39,009
know they they work their own grapes and

372
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,480
then their village it's like a church a

373
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:42,279
little store and then a community

374
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,940
processing facility where they have

375
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,519
these cooperate

376
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,710
models so these champagne producers they

377
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,299
all share time about you know they can

378
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,740
all make their grapes and/or their wine

379
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:52,209
in different processes and store them

380
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,149
but the only way that they could ever

381
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:57,550
survive is by you know communally kind

382
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:58,929
of sharing that whole operation and

383
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:00,969
those are folks they've never had that

384
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:02,589
champagne ever distributed more than 30

385
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,330
miles from where it was grown you know

386
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:06,100
so a friend of mine his company goes and

387
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,730
meets those farmers and brings it over

388
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,649
to the US

389
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,930
that's what California's model needs to

390
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,220
be for the future because I know that in

391
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,500
my neighborhood the paloverde we have

392
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,600
some very very special sacred energy

393
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,070
from like the Native Americans to the

394
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,930
early homesteaders to the cannabis

395
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:22,270
that's grown and I picture people in

396
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:24,370
Tokyo buying a quarter ounce of that

397
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:26,409
stuff and ten years from now going you

398
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,029
can't get this anywhere else and when

399
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:30,370
you hear the story behind it and who

400
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,709
produced it and why it's it's the most

401
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,840
sacred thing in cannabis so that's why I

402
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,930
think something like this is it's really

403
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,660
important because you know what matters

404
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,739
are the producers and the consumers

405
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:43,240
everything in between is a part of the

406
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,340
process but the producers are the

407
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,320
creators and the consumers are the ones

408
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,420
ingesting this and they're the ones who

409
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,300
need the education and to know about the

410
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:53,979
importance of all these things so that's

411
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:55,629
just a little bit man I was really

412
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,980
excited to participate in this and I

413
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:59,470
wish that we had a lot more than just

414
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,590
one hour and then the genetic side of it

415
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,660
is another huge huge thing because you

416
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,939
know who wear your genetics coming from

417
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,250
what what is in them how did they get to

418
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:10,779
be what they are and again that is one

419
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,328
of the greatest stories of cannabis

420
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:15,879
because you know it originally started

421
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:17,198
with some landrace varietals somewhere

422
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,880
that had been growing maybe for

423
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,180
thousands and thousands of years and

424
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,339
over millennia of you know nomadic

425
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,380
tribes traveling and bringing seeds to

426
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:28,539
you know the modernization of cannabis

427
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,600
and all the the you know hybridization

428
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:33,009
it's it's it's kind of like over the

429
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,929
last 70 years there's never been an

430
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:36,400
opportunity to understand any of that to

431
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,350
do medical research it's been too

432
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,810
illegal the people who were paving the

433
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:43,839
way with breeding back in the 70s 80s

434
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:45,190
90s they had such restrictive laws and

435
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,230
law enforcement that they couldn't

436
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,330
document most of their work so now

437
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,370
modern-day cannabis breeders are up

438
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:53,109
against massive challenges in terms of

439
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:55,899
the preservation of these genetics and

440
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:56,919
how do you apply science and weave in

441
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,330
and out so

442
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,789
it's really intense times for the

443
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:02,769
cannabis industry exciting intense I

444
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:04,180
mean it's it's really you know if you

445
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:06,400
look at the end of prohibition of

446
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,570
alcohol you know it didn't just settle

447
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,970
right away to the point where there's

448
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:11,919
five or six conglomerates that bought up

449
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,660
all the companies I mean there were tens

450
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,700
if not hundreds of thousands of people

451
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,620
making their living through some type of

452
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,350
bootlegging being involved in alcohol

453
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:23,529
that transition took decades to settle

454
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:25,389
into you know an industry so this is a

455
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:27,609
really amazing historical time for

456
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,230
cannabis and especially for Northern

457
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:31,240
California we have something really

458
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,500
special to offer to the world and I

459
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,349
think it's really important that we find

460
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,240
a way to represent that properly you

461
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:39,339
know and present it well so that it can

462
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,500
have the impact that it needs to so that

463
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:43,809
our industry doesn't die out and go to a

464
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,789
bunch of greedy corporations and massive

465
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:47,079
scale commodity producers who really

466
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:57,940
only care about money at the end of the

467
00:18:47,079 --> 00:19:00,490
day so that's good morning everybody my

468
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,470
name is Hezekiah Allen it's good to see

469
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,569
you all I know Jeanine did a great job

470
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,610
but Thank You meadowlands Thank You

471
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:09,939
meadow forget us all together again

472
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:12,189
out here been working on this project

473
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,670
called emerald grown I'm sure a handful

474
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:18,820
of you are familiar with emerald grown

475
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:20,650
started it back in late 2014 our first

476
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:22,480
meeting properly turned into a group

477
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,040
therapy session where a bunch of friends

478
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,630
and neighbors were admitting to each

479
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,609
other they were growers for the first

480
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:30,160
time ever there were a fair amount of

481
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:32,679
Tears a lot of laughter and at the end

482
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,640
of the day I think we were stronger for

483
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:39,340
it at the time we were you know sort of

484
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,840
just dusting off our I was born and

485
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:42,399
reborn at home raised off the grid in

486
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:44,199
southern Humboldt my grandparents

487
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,720
started growing in Pennsylvania in the

488
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,309
60s yada ya been a grower all my life

489
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,900
and so we were really just starting to

490
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:51,609
sort of pick our heads up and realize

491
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,890
what life off the hill was going to look

492
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:55,869
like acknowledging the future was coming

493
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,210
and that it was time to be a part of it

494
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:59,529
um you know if we're not a part of it

495
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,340
we're not gonna be a part of it I think

496
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:04,990
simply put so evolved from there into

497
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:06,309
realizing that a lot of what we wanted

498
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,140
to do was still illegal

499
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:09,549
you know Salatin has that book

500
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,540
everything I want to do is illegal

501
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:12,909
something to that

502
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:14,529
fact it still is and it definitely still

503
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,330
was in 2014

504
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:18,309
you know Frenchy and Dan mentioned the

505
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:20,470
cooperative models of the old world in

506
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:22,480
the wine industry we couldn't form coops

507
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,759
we were actually you know weren't

508
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,559
allowed agricultural coops are common in

509
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:28,569
California but we couldn't form them and

510
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,339
so there were a handful of things we

511
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:31,899
identified coming out of those series of

512
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:35,079
meetings that became the advocacy

513
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,850
platform that we advanced in the Capitol

514
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:38,519
over the last few years Appalachians

515
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:41,379
being one of those four pillars

516
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,900
regulation is agriculture sustainability

517
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,310
sort of that the basic core tenants that

518
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,930
we decided make our community what it is

519
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:52,539
I'm pretty pleased to say that we

520
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:55,390
checked off all of those boxes on our

521
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,740
policy goals that's not to say that the

522
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,440
regulations are something that I

523
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:02,529
celebrate as being finished good or even

524
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,039
bearable at this point it is to say that

525
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:07,629
when I don't know if any of you have you

526
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:09,849
know Luke Bruner used to be around at a

527
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,220
lot of these meetings the first meeting

528
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:14,169
that Luke and I we were not invited to

529
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,700
the meeting with senator Korea we

530
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,200
elbowed our way in and they said this is

531
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,640
a closed meeting you have to leave and I

532
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,350
said no we read the law this is the

533
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,450
capital we're allowed to be here this is

534
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:24,549
the people's government that meeting was

535
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,220
proposing the Board of Pharmacy would

536
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:29,649
issue 30 licenses statewide mandatory

537
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,110
vertical integration so while it's not

538
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,870
great just think of how far we've come

539
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:39,699
from that was July of 2014 that was

540
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:43,089
about five years ago so to be here

541
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,610
talking about this topic and talking

542
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:47,409
about what we can do together the bottom

543
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:48,879
line what we've been discovering at

544
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:52,660
least what I've been discovering through

545
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,370
this process of catharsis is that we we

546
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,070
genuinely are stronger together and

547
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:59,139
being able to work together is is

548
00:21:57,069 --> 00:22:02,439
probably the most important thing we can

549
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,840
do you know so hence emerald grown it is

550
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,640
a Federation of cooperatives cannabis

551
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:08,649
cooperative associations are capped at

552
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,720
four acres each we are aggregating

553
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,990
several of those co-ops through this

554
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,519
model you know locally owned facilities

555
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,859
haven't announced this publicly yet but

556
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,690
we do know I own three acres of

557
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:22,119
commercial property just north of Layton

558
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,600
Ville where the first long Valley Center

559
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:25,729
will be built out and then

560
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,469
badda County we have a facility out

561
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,900
there that we're working on build-out

562
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:35,110
sort of to serve as those first hubs

563
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:37,750
[Applause]

564
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:40,129
it's a lot of fun it's a lot of work I

565
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,690
applaud all of you licensees that have

566
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,150
made it through this on the first wave

567
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,919
let me tell you what and you know how

568
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,259
this all ties into our conversation

569
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,090
today obviously marketing is a huge part

570
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:52,400
of our future going forward so we've

571
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:53,808
organized our marketing strategy into

572
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,298
five pillars you know we're going to

573
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:59,119
have a very strong house brand and

574
00:22:56,298 --> 00:23:00,980
emerald grown will be on products at

575
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,899
every price point on every shelf in

576
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,929
about three years I think is what will

577
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:08,120
ramp up - we'll see but one of the one

578
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:10,610
of the the the brand pillars that we

579
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,579
have is the regional brands and this is

580
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:16,308
an adventurous playful marketing effort

581
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:18,710
it is a welcoming hand taking you on the

582
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:21,048
adventure of your lifetime into the

583
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,690
middle of nowhere in California these

584
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:26,089
most beautiful beaches where you can

585
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,740
find the solitude these most bustling of

586
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:30,470
urban areas where you can find the

587
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,509
culture we need to be a guide we need to

588
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,970
welcome and invite people into this

589
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:37,250
experience but we need to do it in a way

590
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,829
that's open and inclusive because the

591
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,048
beautiful thing about Appalachians to me

592
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:45,558
and about the their shared assets

593
00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:47,509
I am unabashedly a socialist it's no

594
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:49,700
surprise that these programs largely

595
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:52,129
developed in socialist countries where

596
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,140
quality of life matters the idea of

597
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,090
taking something from France there's so

598
00:23:54,140 --> 00:24:00,259
many policies in France that would be so

599
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:03,288
unpalatable in in the US economic system

600
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:06,048
but the more that we can cross pollinate

601
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:08,000
between our market driven system and the

602
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:09,889
common good that is more common in

603
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,019
European social democracies the better

604
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:16,820
humanity is going to be in my opinion

605
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:20,119
and so this idea of thanks yeah right

606
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:24,619
yeah humanity go us we don't totally

607
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:26,329
suck yet sorry I swear like 30 years

608
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:28,129
until civilization goes away if we don't

609
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:29,538
do better so let's just keep that in the

610
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,370
back of our minds while we're building

611
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:33,048
our cannabis industry that we're not

612
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,579
just building our cannabis industry I

613
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:36,679
think that we're building a beacon of

614
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:37,189
hope for the broader world if we do it

615
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,100
right

616
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,049
and so you know the the these are shared

617
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:45,379
assets that's the common point nobody

618
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:47,269
owns Mendocino nobody owns bell Springs

619
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,370
these are all of ours we've built them

620
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:52,400
together and it is our responsibility

621
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:54,649
and it is incumbent on us to manage them

622
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,960
together and to share the benefits of

623
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,640
those things equitably you know right

624
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,590
now unfortunately we're doing this panel

625
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,930
at the same time as equity to me this

626
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:05,000
conversation is about equity how do we

627
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:07,220
manage shared resources is about

628
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,259
fairness and equity and to try to

629
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,750
privatize those things to try to make

630
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:13,910
them mine is unacceptable and it's a

631
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,859
moral travesty tragedy that we all need

632
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:20,840
to call bullshit on and we all need to

633
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:22,389
be better than that so I know I know

634
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,149
that that we didn't come here

635
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:30,020
necessarily on this Saturday Sunday

636
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:32,390
Sunday weekend in the woods to like hold

637
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:33,680
our feet to the fire but it is how it is

638
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,170
in my life

639
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,299
feet to the fire we need to manage these

640
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,580
assets together we need to do better and

641
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:43,419
be better and I am excited to be a part

642
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:43,419
of that with all of you

643
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,009
[Applause]

644
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,539
i'm dale hunt i was i just want to start

645
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:54,019
by saying i was excited to be on this

646
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:56,389
panel before i heard all this and it's

647
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:58,670
just an honor to be on this panel with

648
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:04,940
everybody here

649
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:06,470
I started as a botanist I somebody told

650
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,509
me in college that I couldn't consider

651
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,549
myself educated unless I'd had a biology

652
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:14,269
class and botany fit in my schedule so I

653
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:15,950
took botany and after three sessions it

654
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:18,230
was so fascinating to me I changed my

655
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,000
major and I I never looked back I had no

656
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:24,470
good reason to take botany but I loved

657
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,029
it so much I that was my major so and

658
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,190
then I stuck around for a master's

659
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:29,720
degree in plant genetics just because I

660
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:34,009
didn't have anything better to do and

661
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:36,650
then I I went to UC San Diego to do a

662
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:39,920
PhD in molecular and cell biology which

663
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,240
I did also in plants and by then I knew

664
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,860
I didn't want to be a professor so I

665
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,910
went to Berkeley for law school and

666
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:45,909
became a patent attorney

667
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:53,579
and even that was a long-ass time ago so

668
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:55,199
23 years ago I started working as an

669
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:58,139
attorney in a law firm and one of our

670
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,450
clients was a Central Valley fruit

671
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,060
company that made great varieties of

672
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:05,549
stone fruits and and grapevines table

673
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,589
grapes and I had the opportunity to help

674
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:09,839
them protect their their genetics all

675
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:10,829
around the world and not just protect

676
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,000
but commercialize

677
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:19,409
so I in addition to that I did a bunch

678
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,210
of other kinds of patents but I didn't

679
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:25,050
know that I was preparing myself to work

680
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:28,340
in the cannabis industry but I was so my

681
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:30,629
mission now really I the way I see it is

682
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:33,959
the difference and I've worked with a

683
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:36,330
lot of other plant genetics companies

684
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,910
but the difference between all of those

685
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:40,619
companies and every other every other

686
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:44,580
company I know that works with plant

687
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:46,049
breeders and this industry is that in

688
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,329
every one of those companies the plant

689
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:49,680
breeders are employees they're either

690
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:51,599
the founders of the companies in which

691
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,980
case they're doing great or their

692
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:54,959
employees and they sign their

693
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,960
assignments of their patent rights and

694
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,960
they have fine jobs but their employees

695
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:05,940
and in this in this industry they are

696
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:08,700
III in many cases they're successful

697
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:11,220
entrepreneurs already but otherwise they

698
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,160
are they're the rebels they're the

699
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,870
outlaws they're the survivors but I

700
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,210
think they need to be the rock stars and

701
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:21,119
they are going to be the absolute rock

702
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,380
stars of this industry you know who they

703
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,579
are you know who you are

704
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,140
and super creative this is the most this

705
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:30,869
is the plant with the greatest genetic

706
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:35,810
potential of any we already know that

707
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:39,869
and but there's one other thing about

708
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:42,179
about this plant that is this is this is

709
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:46,229
not unique to this plant but it's it's

710
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:47,610
unusual at least that the the patent

711
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,289
system I don't want to bore the hell out

712
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:52,819
of you but I do have to tell you this

713
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:55,619
that's why I'm here the patent system

714
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:58,349
for plants is kind of divided between

715
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:59,639
it's divided three ways it's divided

716
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:02,549
between plants that you

717
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,950
bigot asexually and and and you know the

718
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:08,609
plants that you clone or plants that you

719
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:10,080
propagate with seeds and obviously as

720
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:12,569
you know with cannabis you go both ways

721
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,220
right and so that that makes it

722
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:15,980
complicated even know what how to

723
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,450
protect what you're what you're what

724
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,279
you're doing or which which kind of IP

725
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,720
to get so I was on the phone yesterday

726
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:25,500
with a friend of mine who was speaking

727
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,970
at a at a cannabis event a patent

728
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,920
attorney is speaking at a cannabis event

729
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:32,579
in DC and she said just gave me this

730
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:34,380
short rundown on I need to sound like I

731
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:36,000
know what I'm talking about I said we'll

732
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,740
just read the blog I posted last week

733
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,220
and she said I don't have time I said

734
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,930
it's five minutes at most she said just

735
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,910
just give me just explain it to me

736
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,740
quickly I said okay well first thing you

737
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,120
need to know is they might make their

738
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,859
money by selling clones or they might

739
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,619
make for their money by selling seeds or

740
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:54,029
they might just sell harvested material

741
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:59,159
they might make an extract and she said

742
00:29:54,029 --> 00:30:01,139
what and and the kind of IP they get

743
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,480
totally depends on what they're making

744
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,930
their money oh okay

745
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,700
and then I said anyway we had this whole

746
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,990
conversation and she decided it was way

747
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,490
too complicated and she's just gonna

748
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:16,680
send everybody to me you know that's

749
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:21,630
great but one other story I want to tell

750
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:24,390
you I I have you know if you're an

751
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,040
attorney you work in an office a lot one

752
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,080
of my favorite things I ever did was to

753
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:30,210
get out of the office and come up here

754
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,220
and meet with one of my clients who's a

755
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,799
plant breeder he has a farm up in late

756
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,360
and vil way up in the hills and he sent

757
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,389
me back to San Diego with a bunch of

758
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:42,449
samples and two of my favorite people

759
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:46,140
that I work with are experts at tasting

760
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:48,240
cannabis and so I brought them back some

761
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,490
stuff from here and it didn't look like

762
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,049
the stuff they usually get I think

763
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:55,640
because the stuff they usually get isn't

764
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:58,619
grown outdoors in Mendocino County and

765
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,240
they looked at it kind of they said oh

766
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:03,239
this doesn't look like what we usually

767
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,490
get and then they started to roll it and

768
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,990
say this is super sticky and then they

769
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:10,579
smoked it and they said this is the best

770
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,579
stuff we've ever had

771
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:21,250
yeah yeah and then the next time I went

772
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:24,459
on a road trip they came with me this is

773
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:29,048
just this is special this is being here

774
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:31,058
as special working with people who who

775
00:31:29,048 --> 00:31:32,730
grow the plant is special I just I

776
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:36,908
really do feel like it's an honor to be

777
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:39,250
part of this industry and I'm just glad

778
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:44,769
to be here with you so let's go thank

779
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:46,720
you I really want to take the

780
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:49,120
conversation specifically into genetic

781
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,980
resources I think from an appellations

782
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:52,869
perspective it's really kind of the

783
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,480
heart and soul of the designation

784
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:59,199
because it's really the plant in the

785
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:02,740
product where the place the practices

786
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,200
the the cultural knowledge behind how

787
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,808
the plant is produced and loved and

788
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,389
nurtured into a product really expresses

789
00:32:07,808 --> 00:32:13,538
through the cultivar and cannabis is

790
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:15,449
such a responsive plant it responds so

791
00:32:13,538 --> 00:32:17,500
personally to our endocannabinoid system

792
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,750
to the environment that we're

793
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,579
cultivating in and our practices I think

794
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:25,000
it's really kind of the heart and soul

795
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:26,678
of how we differentiate ourselves and

796
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,230
and how these appellation of origin

797
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:32,850
designations will come into bearing

798
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:37,630
fruit for us and there's a number of

799
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:39,189
threats to our biodiversity real quick

800
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:43,090
I'd like to see a show hands for the

801
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:44,798
breeders in the house there's a lot of

802
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:46,589
people here thank you so much for all

803
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,700
your work

804
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:54,009
we wouldn't be here without you

805
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:55,509
really so we're facing you know first of

806
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:58,778
all it's an annual plant right and so

807
00:32:55,509 --> 00:33:01,089
the the risk to losing our cultivar

808
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:03,599
lines is already high right from the

809
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:06,158
start as an annual and then we're facing

810
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,619
regional bands where before we had the

811
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,750
capacity to cultivate under you know

812
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:14,888
previous our previous you know

813
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:16,808
regulatory regime we've got hemp coming

814
00:33:14,888 --> 00:33:19,918
forward and that you know does pose a

815
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:23,349
risk to our cultivars as we transition

816
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,820
rapidly and to have cultivars

817
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:28,059
you know there's a number of things

818
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:30,339
facing really like threatening our

819
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:32,109
genetic resources and so I think it's

820
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:35,169
important to really contextualize this

821
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:36,639
is as like the first priority when we're

822
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,650
working to really establish our

823
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,290
appellation of origin protections and

824
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:43,120
really build the tools that we need to

825
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:46,509
meaningful meaningfully protect our

826
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:48,369
cultivars moving forward and you know to

827
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:49,900
look at the international context

828
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:52,119
because appellation of origin is an

829
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,970
international protection there's a

830
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:57,969
number of ways that the world bodies

831
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,740
have frames avenues of protection for

832
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,440
our work right so you look at the World

833
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,930
Health Organization and there's

834
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,029
international policy tools around rights

835
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,710
of access to traditional medicine this

836
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:10,960
is a traditional medicine right that

837
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,250
we've been really nurturing over the

838
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,230
decades and I think it's really

839
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,969
important to remember that there's

840
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,409
traditional knowledge embedded in the

841
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:20,469
work that we're doing traditional

842
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:21,639
cultural perspectives and expressions

843
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:24,009
and these are the things that we're

844
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:27,070
protecting last year there was a pretty

845
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:29,409
amazing piece of policy that was

846
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:31,360
approved by the UN it's the declaration

847
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:34,389
on the rights of peasants and other

848
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,980
working people in rural areas and their

849
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:38,260
specific language in there to protect

850
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:40,030
our genetic resources and recognition

851
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,669
about how that's a bedrock of rural

852
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:44,560
economies and agrarian economies and so

853
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:46,119
I want to put those thoughts forward and

854
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,009
understand that we're creating an

855
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,339
appellation of origin system not for

856
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:54,159
wine but for a traditional medicine and

857
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,690
so there's a unique perspective and set

858
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,730
of considerations that we need to put

859
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,950
into this work as we frame these

860
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,230
protections not just for the producers

861
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:04,239
and the consumers but for the patients

862
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,610
right because how we produce our

863
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:09,099
medicine and what genetics where we're

864
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,410
working with and how those express in

865
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:18,009
the diverse expression of cannabinoids

866
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:19,299
and terpenoids defore front of how we're

867
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,600
building our appellation of origin

868
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:25,690
system so really wanted to put some some

869
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:27,339
love out for the history of medical

870
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,349
cannabis advocacy and how we've all

871
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,269
gotten here over the decades and really

872
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:34,569
give thanks to that aspect of the plant

873
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:38,389
as a as a healing healing plant

874
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:40,760
so with genetic preservation it's uh

875
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:42,619
it's it's all about the details so for

876
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,730
instance with Platt plant patenting what

877
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:46,190
you would do is you would characterize

878
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:49,010
these genetics the big question that we

879
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:50,990
need to figure out is what genetics grow

880
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:53,150
well in specific regions and for what

881
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:54,889
purposes and that's the thing there's

882
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,050
there's no research into that you know

883
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:59,449
there's neighborhoods where someone may

884
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,940
have been developing a varietal for you

885
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:04,279
know a decade two decades three decades

886
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,289
but we don't have the research to know

887
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,120
what variety is going to perform better

888
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:10,159
in this coastal environment versus this

889
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:11,989
inland climate and for what reasons now

890
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,109
we have the farmers are the ones who

891
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:17,089
have that data so really man this whole

892
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:19,039
conversation we should leave politics

893
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,750
out of it because this is all about

894
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:21,949
representing the farmers the farmers are

895
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,869
the ones who have this information

896
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:25,879
they're the ones who have this

897
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:28,190
experience you know most farmers were

898
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,500
afraid to write down notes you couldn't

899
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,119
keep data records of your yields you

900
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,010
know I remember being at a poker game

901
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,969
where someone was talking about all the

902
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,710
records that they have from their

903
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:38,119
harvest and trimming records and they

904
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,679
got laughed out of the room because

905
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:41,119
these guys are like dude you're gonna if

906
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,319
they raid your house you're gonna get

907
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,819
indicted and they're gonna have all this

908
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,130
information on all these genetics

909
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,440
records so we used to have notebooks and

910
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:51,230
you know have them buried in the woods

911
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,079
with all the the trimming records data

912
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:56,179
collection analysis on on breeding and

913
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,440
phenotype characterization we would bury

914
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:59,719
that in the woods and literally have to

915
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,280
hike 15 minutes anytime we wanted to see

916
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,539
a note on a phenotype the next time

917
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,880
we're making a breeding selection round

918
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:06,980
so the thing is it's a big discussion of

919
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,170
how do we know what varieties are gonna

920
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:11,179
grow best in what regions and it's kind

921
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,039
of like this is brand-new we need to

922
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:16,489
bring farmers together and compare notes

923
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,750
first this area verse this area and you

924
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:19,129
know there's gonna be some science

925
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,659
that's gonna need to be applied to it

926
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,789
which is a very difficult thing for

927
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:25,460
growers to start to get into that notion

928
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:26,989
of applying science to their their

929
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,059
intuition which has come from their

930
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:30,469
instinct and intuitive experience and

931
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:33,679
relationship with the plants so it's a

932
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:35,449
whole new spectrum but I think the first

933
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:37,909
part of it is starting to characterize

934
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:40,429
these genetics beyond like oh is it into

935
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:42,589
Costa Teva or a hybrid or gross like

936
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:45,739
this we need to get into what are the

937
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:47,500
textures to the flavor profiles and the

938
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:48,759
details of the cannabinoid

939
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,329
and the terpenes and how do those

940
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:54,400
cannabinoids and terpenoids for for what

941
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:56,440
reasons and and beyond that just

942
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,869
characteristic you know the the vigor

943
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,389
the structure is it symmetrical is it

944
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:03,250
elongated is there you know a redness to

945
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:06,159
the stem all that needs to be it's like

946
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:08,108
the next step of cannabis genetics it's

947
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,960
it's intense and it's interesting

948
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:13,000
because you know cannabis growers

949
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,260
sometimes are you know people who keep

950
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,960
to themselves and are way out in the

951
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,040
hills starting to interact with

952
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,389
attorneys you know people who have that

953
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:21,639
experience I mean that's the next step

954
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:23,259
it's coming together the problem is when

955
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:24,339
you take people from outside of cannabis

956
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,990
you always need to question their

957
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,670
intentions why are they doing this and

958
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:29,049
what do they want out of this and you

959
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,180
know everybody wants to support their

960
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:32,710
families and make a living and there is

961
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:34,419
going to be people who come in from

962
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,949
outside industries with the intentions

963
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,840
of I want to help these people preserve

964
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:39,579
their work I want to help them do it

965
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,050
right but we also need to be careful for

966
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:43,539
people who are coming into it for the

967
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,840
wrong reasons so yeah can we talk about

968
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:50,230
trust issues we need to talk about trust

969
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:53,309
right because we got some serious that

970
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:57,130
there are some serious trust problems in

971
00:38:53,309 --> 00:39:02,769
right I mean the thought before we go

972
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:06,088
into protecting genetic you have a pool

973
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:09,309
of genetics that is unique and amazing

974
00:39:06,088 --> 00:39:12,219
the problem that that pool of genetic

975
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:15,730
are in the oils and you're going

976
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:18,549
whatever they're going down south which

977
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:22,240
you shouldn't do so you're going son

978
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:24,310
gone genetic wedding cake and all the

979
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,858
stuff that everybody else and his

980
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:29,469
brother is going and you're competing

981
00:39:26,858 --> 00:39:32,230
with the same genetic with some with

982
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:36,639
indoor it's not the solution because you

983
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:41,440
have much better so if you could go back

984
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:45,368
and take what you have in your cupboard

985
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,500
and then took all those data of the old

986
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:50,650
good old days and bring back the

987
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,659
genetics that created everything that we

988
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:56,380
actually smoking today and that is

989
00:39:52,659 --> 00:40:00,279
weaker than their parents and

990
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,059
grandparents and great-grandparents you

991
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,460
you have

992
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:07,000
seeing that is unique and it's not

993
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:10,360
really a loom because you don't let you

994
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,210
see it spend the winter in the inner

995
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:16,329
ground that's you need that you need

996
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:18,820
that full cycle of the genetic if you

997
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:22,869
really want your plan to become heirloom

998
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:26,320
and become the place where it it did ago

999
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:30,659
you need to understand the value of the

1000
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:33,250
genetic because like Gen inside

1001
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:35,529
so first things basically that they

1002
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,570
didn't you in an inner in a wine

1003
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:40,450
industry when they created all those

1004
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:44,380
appellation it's a classification of

1005
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:47,049
quality so that jelly when there is no

1006
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:50,309
standout of quality which is the best of

1007
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:53,740
the best going in specific region in

1008
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:56,380
specific farm then everything else that

1009
00:40:53,739 --> 00:41:00,369
come into play in your own region have

1010
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:03,160
to be able to keep Zeus down down

1011
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:06,099
everything that is not Zeus Tonda have

1012
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:10,179
nothing to do in your territory so that

1013
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:13,079
the source of everything is you I'm so

1014
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:17,349
dependent on you it's silly I'm like a

1015
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:19,989
winemaker and I shouldn't even have my

1016
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:23,380
name on the packaging the name on my

1017
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:25,929
packaging the ashes made it's yours when

1018
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:28,570
I was traveling in producing country

1019
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:31,389
nobody can really much that I made the

1020
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:34,870
US but they were asking me which Valley

1021
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:37,809
wish amulet which altitude and this is

1022
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:41,259
long race you have so much more value

1023
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:45,460
because beyond the farmer actually tell

1024
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:47,530
Wow it's long it's a climate it's a

1025
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,829
genetic but it's more than the thermal

1026
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:54,820
it's a community around the farmer

1027
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:57,969
actually the farmer is the part of the

1028
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:01,510
osmosis but that community around that

1029
00:41:57,969 --> 00:42:04,629
farmer is super important for for the

1030
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:07,690
quality literally of the product so it's

1031
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:10,769
like you really have to to realize how

1032
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:13,260
valuable you are and how valuable

1033
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:15,480
everything you have is

1034
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:17,480
and bring it back on the market because

1035
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,159
that's what makes you different from

1036
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:23,400
anywhere in the world and I've been to

1037
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:27,750
quite a few producing country yeah and

1038
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:30,240
before me before diving into trust

1039
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:33,929
issues I want to take a minute to you

1040
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:36,359
know Frenchy is probably the one of the

1041
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:40,199
more if not the most travel the Heche a

1042
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:42,420
scene that I know I've been to a handful

1043
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:44,730
of these countries to also in my

1044
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:47,010
wanderings and and it's absolutely true

1045
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:50,190
you know the the diversity here the

1046
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:53,400
biodiversity the culture genetics I

1047
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:55,470
agree is step one for the the fact that

1048
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,480
there are so many external threats to

1049
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:59,730
our genetics we have to start by

1050
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,429
protecting what is most threatened but I

1051
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:05,760
don't think by any means that genetic

1052
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:07,379
stands apart from the other elements of

1053
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,990
what makes good cannabis good I think

1054
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:13,410
microclimate climate is very important I

1055
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:15,269
think culture standards the way that the

1056
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:17,069
communities are structured the way that

1057
00:43:15,269 --> 00:43:19,949
we share information the way that we

1058
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:21,870
treat ideas wisdom and experience as

1059
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:23,699
things that can raise everybody as

1060
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:25,799
opposed to something to privatize and

1061
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:27,509
take and so again it goes back to some

1062
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,610
of those fundamental questions of how we

1063
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:31,950
structure social institutions and how we

1064
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:33,480
structure our businesses you know when

1065
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:36,839
we start to talk about the commercial

1066
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,909
aspect of it speaking specifically to

1067
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:42,260
genetics and I don't mean to be terribly

1068
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:45,389
doom and gloom but climate is changing

1069
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:48,690
my you know my family's varietal of

1070
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:51,509
afghani that we've localized to our tiny

1071
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,090
little sliver of the natal mid metal

1072
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:56,070
honey dew dry creek upper east branch of

1073
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,700
the dry creek if we get really technical

1074
00:43:56,070 --> 00:44:00,030
about it

1075
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:02,609
that afghani is not growing the same in

1076
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:04,260
that watershed as it was when I was 10

1077
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:06,840
you know that that's been our family

1078
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,640
farm family ranch what ever since I was

1079
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,079
seven it doesn't grow the same there

1080
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,569
anymore and yeah we're 30 generations

1081
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,509
deep into it but the climate is changing

1082
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:17,789
around us and so there's this impulse

1083
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:20,160
that I have to preserve protect and hold

1084
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:22,590
and I'm finding myself very often

1085
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,379
needing to focus on the mantra of adapt

1086
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:27,599
evolve and flow as well and they they

1087
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,970
they it's nice that it takes

1088
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,680
so comfortably to our culture but I find

1089
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:33,568
sometimes that articulating these things

1090
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:36,149
really helps me realize them and bring

1091
00:44:33,568 --> 00:44:37,798
them into shared space and so we do need

1092
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,960
to be attentive to the changing

1093
00:44:37,798 --> 00:44:42,748
conditions around us I know you know

1094
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,539
just not to bring too much politics in

1095
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:48,449
it I know cdfw and the water board are

1096
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:51,089
kicking our asses to some degree but

1097
00:44:48,449 --> 00:44:52,949
it's for a reason and our culture and

1098
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:55,199
our processes need to be adaptable

1099
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:57,478
enough to continue to persist I am

1100
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:00,058
incredibly thankful that cannabis is so

1101
00:44:57,478 --> 00:45:01,739
diverse that it expresses itself so many

1102
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:03,539
different ways sometimes it's

1103
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:05,039
frustrating that it expresses itself so

1104
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:07,289
many different ways really wanted the

1105
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:08,999
HOS ones to be you know that that

1106
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:12,390
particular expression and they weren't

1107
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:15,419
and that can be a drag etc but we have

1108
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:18,478
this very very very dynamic core of

1109
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,548
genetic material core of experience of

1110
00:45:18,478 --> 00:45:22,528
narrative and culture and being able to

1111
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:25,018
both hold on to that and preserve it and

1112
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:26,670
keep it safe and steward it be the

1113
00:45:25,018 --> 00:45:28,798
guardians of it like we've always been

1114
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:31,139
while also acknowledging that the world

1115
00:45:28,798 --> 00:45:33,329
is changing around us both regulatorily

1116
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:35,009
commercially but also just fundamentally

1117
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:37,920
climatologically changing

1118
00:45:35,009 --> 00:45:40,019
it's a tricky tricky intersection to be

1119
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,389
in but this is the community to be in

1120
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:44,189
that crossroads and and let's let's keep

1121
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:45,629
at it and I didn't mean to derail from

1122
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:47,009
the Tres conversation I think it's

1123
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:49,410
really critical I just wanted to mention

1124
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:52,650
those few key points oh I'm glad you did

1125
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:54,659
I'm glad you did and I don't want to

1126
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:57,509
have this turn into a conversation about

1127
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:59,568
trust instead of the topic but I think

1128
00:45:57,509 --> 00:46:04,190
it ties into the topic because I think

1129
00:45:59,568 --> 00:46:08,969
protecting genetics there is a need to

1130
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:11,778
reassess trust I'll tell you one of the

1131
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:19,349
first in-person client meetings I had

1132
00:46:11,778 --> 00:46:21,150
with a with a nursery the the person I

1133
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:23,548
was meeting with told me that he was

1134
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:26,700
evaluating whether to protect any of his

1135
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:29,579
any of his cultivars any of his genetics

1136
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:31,788
and he said that he had one that was

1137
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:35,160
pretty valuable that he liked a lot and

1138
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:37,200
he gave some clones to somebody on kind

1139
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:41,048
of a handshake agreement that this guy

1140
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:42,938
would pay him per clone

1141
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:45,538
and he never saw any money he figured

1142
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:48,608
that the clothes that that particular

1143
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:50,589
strangest never went anywhere I'm using

1144
00:46:48,608 --> 00:46:52,838
strain in the vernacular sense we can

1145
00:46:50,588 --> 00:46:55,268
use cultivar I'm not as as obsessed with

1146
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:59,548
that as some people are and I'm actually

1147
00:46:55,268 --> 00:47:02,708
going to update my blog about that but

1148
00:46:59,548 --> 00:47:06,489
he said that a year later he saw that

1149
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:08,618
very cultivar in a catalog his buddy's

1150
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:13,059
catalog so he called his friend and said

1151
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:16,028
hey we had a deal and his friend said

1152
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:18,359
you know I got I got employees I got

1153
00:47:16,028 --> 00:47:19,619
bills to pay you know how things are

1154
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:21,308
sorry

1155
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:23,259
done that was the end of the

1156
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:24,789
conversation they didn't have a written

1157
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:27,278
agreement he didn't have any IP

1158
00:47:24,789 --> 00:47:29,679
protection and he thought he knew who he

1159
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:34,329
could trust but he he was he made a

1160
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:38,619
mistake things change we all know you

1161
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:41,140
know we're not here to rehash Philo's

1162
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:43,028
but we know that you think you know who

1163
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:52,388
you can trust and then and then things

1164
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:53,829
change you if you grew up in the some of

1165
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:56,259
my favorite breeders the ones that grew

1166
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:58,329
up breeding the plant in the 70s and 80s

1167
00:47:56,259 --> 00:48:00,458
and you absolutely knew you couldn't

1168
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:02,709
trust the government so the last thing

1169
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:04,618
you want to do is trust the government

1170
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:07,629
to seek intellectual property protection

1171
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:10,778
but guess what that's that's who grants

1172
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:14,108
intellectual property protection so it's

1173
00:48:10,778 --> 00:48:15,458
time to just kind of reassess I'm not

1174
00:48:14,108 --> 00:48:18,009
even I'm not even going to tell you who

1175
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:18,638
to trust I'm just saying reassess your

1176
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:20,559
trust

1177
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:23,579
think about who to trust and then I

1178
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:26,229
think that's a really great point sorry

1179
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:27,939
I just wanted to speak to that really

1180
00:48:26,228 --> 00:48:30,518
quickly I don't think it's as much about

1181
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:32,199
trust as it is about you know what are

1182
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:34,448
our methodologies in place what are our

1183
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:35,918
filters right what are our resources so

1184
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:38,499
that we have the education and the

1185
00:48:35,918 --> 00:48:40,239
understanding you know behind what the

1186
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:42,158
tools are that we can protect and how to

1187
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,778
negotiate our contracts and I want to

1188
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:46,989
give a shout out to the trade

1189
00:48:43,778 --> 00:48:49,059
associations because they're really here

1190
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:51,159
to serve you as an industry and

1191
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:54,070
aggregate resources and bring that

1192
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:56,590
education and that knowledge base to

1193
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:59,200
pour your efforts in protecting your IP

1194
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:00,700
developing your Appalachians and also

1195
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:03,069
navigating contracting

1196
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:05,049
I mean who of us you know has so much

1197
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,760
experience with contract law you know

1198
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:08,620
prior to five years ago right so there's

1199
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,320
a whole cultural transition in place and

1200
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:14,409
really looking to our local associations

1201
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:18,130
as the bedrock to navigate in negotiate

1202
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:20,980
policy contracts resources research you

1203
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:22,869
know and looking really doing our due

1204
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,090
diligence as individuals and as

1205
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:27,219
communities and through our associations

1206
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:29,519
to really vet you know what the tools

1207
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:31,869
are in the filters through which we're

1208
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:34,389
pursuing our research and our data

1209
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:36,159
aggregation and our ownership and so you

1210
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:37,569
know to that point I think is a really

1211
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,000
important thing to keep in mind as a

1212
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:41,140
resource and really support you know

1213
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,989
your community through your trade

1214
00:49:41,139 --> 00:49:45,339
associations right so so that's good

1215
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:48,189
there's a lot of good knowledge here I

1216
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:50,079
respectfully agree with half of that I

1217
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,639
disagree with the other half and and I

1218
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,230
just wanted to say that Hezekiah point

1219
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:54,879
on climate change is a really important

1220
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,920
factor because I've only been in

1221
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,990
California for ten years eleven seasons

1222
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,240
that I've seen fall harvests of and I've

1223
00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:03,429
seen drastic changes in the way that

1224
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:05,019
varieties perform you know and every

1225
00:50:03,429 --> 00:50:07,329
season is different if you have a hot

1226
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:08,829
September two years ago it was 95 plus

1227
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:10,509
degrees in my neighborhood for 21 days

1228
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:11,949
in September so we have a delayed

1229
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,090
ripening you know it's so the plants

1230
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:14,980
think that it's the middle of the summer

1231
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:17,829
again so that's that's a real challenge

1232
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:19,990
to to consider in terms of the the local

1233
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:21,940
trade organizations look when someone

1234
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:23,979
starts devoting their time to something

1235
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:26,349
there's a purpose it's either a selfless

1236
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,690
purpose of giving back or they want

1237
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:31,029
something out of it it can be both and

1238
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:32,650
so the thing is I think for those trade

1239
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:34,900
organizations who want both like

1240
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:36,849
Hezekiah grew up in southern Humboldt so

1241
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,139
I'm trying to preserve the community in

1242
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:40,389
southern Humboldt where I'm still a

1243
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:42,309
transplant you know it's like I finally

1244
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:43,869
own my own place it's my dream but I

1245
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:45,429
still consider myself an outsider

1246
00:50:43,869 --> 00:50:47,769
because there's people who sacrificed

1247
00:50:45,429 --> 00:50:49,329
way longer than I have so with these

1248
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:50,949
trade associations there needs to be

1249
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:52,630
more inclusion of the farmers because

1250
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:53,829
how many of the farmers actually have

1251
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:56,619
the information and how many of the

1252
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:58,690
people in the trade association know all

1253
00:50:56,619 --> 00:51:00,429
the information but anyway just go into

1254
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:01,900
the fun part and talking about plants

1255
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:03,009
and genetics and preservation because I

1256
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,079
thought it would be a lot more fun to

1257
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:06,730
talk about weed and growing weed on this

1258
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:08,049
panel then then you know all the the

1259
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,539
politics and trade is

1260
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:13,269
so genetic preservation for the future

1261
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:14,590
in terms of the breeding or threat you

1262
00:51:13,269 --> 00:51:16,000
know preservation of genetics it's

1263
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:18,460
really it's really two forms one is

1264
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,829
through seed production and selection

1265
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,179
and breeding programs which is that's

1266
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:24,130
what I spend a lot of my time

1267
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:26,259
daydreaming of since I was a little kid

1268
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:27,970
and you know really liked to get into

1269
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,830
and love to speak about and the other is

1270
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:32,769
through clone propagation and

1271
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:34,059
preservation however when you look at

1272
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:35,320
what's happening with the clones like

1273
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:37,119
when you mentioned wedding cake it's

1274
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,240
like something becomes a popular variety

1275
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:42,670
the market gets hot everybody gets it it

1276
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,289
gets really oversaturated people don't

1277
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:45,970
take good care of their mothers you know

1278
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:47,289
and so there's always like the next

1279
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:49,239
greatest thing so I think it's really

1280
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:50,619
special when you find the varietals that

1281
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,239
have been like you said your family's

1282
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:53,980
been working genetics for 30 years the

1283
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:55,959
people who started bringing you know

1284
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,820
different Afghan ease into these regions

1285
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,139
when people just used to grow sativas

1286
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,850
that would come in their bag seed that

1287
00:51:59,139 --> 00:52:02,469
was shipped over by the Megaton from

1288
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:05,319
South America and Colombia and it never

1289
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:08,829
finished in time but in terms of clonal

1290
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:10,809
propagation we now face all these new

1291
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:13,119
challenges with with pests and pathogens

1292
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:13,869
and disease if you compare it to other

1293
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,759
industries

1294
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:17,589
I think the banana industry is a really

1295
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,350
good comparison where there's like

1296
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:23,260
10,000 varietals of bananas but we only

1297
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:25,299
use three of them because most of them

1298
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,680
don't store well they have to be shipped

1299
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,750
and transported across all these

1300
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:30,609
countries and what happened I believe it

1301
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:33,250
was in the 80s or 90s I'm no expert I

1302
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:34,870
may be completely miss speaking but

1303
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,760
basically a plant virus and pathogen

1304
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:38,829
wiped out a ton of the commercial

1305
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,630
produced banana varieties so what

1306
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:42,699
Americans were eating as bananas in the

1307
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,260
50s is not what we eat as bananas

1308
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:46,689
because that species pretty much doesn't

1309
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:48,640
exist anymore it it basically got taken

1310
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:51,579
out by a pathogen so for the clones that

1311
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:53,679
we have from the time that I showed up

1312
00:52:51,579 --> 00:52:57,309
all these pests you know powder mildew

1313
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:59,949
Russert mites root a FIDs and now you

1314
00:52:57,309 --> 00:53:01,389
know unidentified plant pathogens and

1315
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:03,039
viruses are now present in our

1316
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:05,019
environment which is also due to global

1317
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:07,179
warming so before I came here I had only

1318
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:08,650
seen powdery mildew once most of my

1319
00:53:07,179 --> 00:53:10,089
neighbors had never seen powdery mildew

1320
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,349
I I heard when they first started seeing

1321
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:13,750
it they thought they were crystals on

1322
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:15,579
the weed you know and if you look

1323
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:18,730
there's a there's a University study out

1324
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:20,860
of out of Mendocino from like 2011-2012

1325
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,579
that each year the spore count for

1326
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,559
Powder Mill

1327
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:25,090
is dramatically increasing every single

1328
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:27,039
year in the environment so farmers have

1329
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:29,470
to be smarter about how to prevent that

1330
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:31,509
and combat that by using you know

1331
00:53:29,469 --> 00:53:34,089
organic microbiology and living soils

1332
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:37,770
but the paths and pathogens are really

1333
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:40,180
the biggest risk because just you know

1334
00:53:37,769 --> 00:53:41,739
let me think of how to phrase this so

1335
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:43,179
basically all these clones that we grow

1336
00:53:41,739 --> 00:53:44,529
they stay in people's mother rooms

1337
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:46,239
people go through different treatments

1338
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:49,120
even with some of the best organic

1339
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:51,849
practices you can't you can't prevent

1340
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,259
against certain bacterias and so it's

1341
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:55,089
really important for us to start working

1342
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,830
with science and thinking about micro

1343
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:58,600
propagation which is essentially tissue

1344
00:53:56,829 --> 00:54:00,429
culture where we can bank these genetics

1345
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:02,139
what can happen with technologies people

1346
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:04,119
can clean the genetics for instance I

1347
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:06,549
love Sour Diesel I've been growing it

1348
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:09,400
since 2002 like back in the East Coast

1349
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:11,230
and it's an old clone it's been around

1350
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:14,019
since the 90s oh gee cush is from the

1351
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:16,510
early 90s any grower in here who's grown

1352
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:18,909
in sfv clone it's not fun or easy to

1353
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:20,260
grow because it's been passed around you

1354
00:54:18,909 --> 00:54:21,940
don't know where it came from and

1355
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,730
imagine what's gotten into it in terms

1356
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:26,500
of pathogen disease and viruses with

1357
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:28,840
tissue culture propagation you can take

1358
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:31,150
that sfe clone it can be completely

1359
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:33,280
wiped clean remove all the bacteria

1360
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,690
essentially disinfecting it and then

1361
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,400
when you get those back in tissue

1362
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:38,650
cultures whether it's a mother or clones

1363
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,570
for propagation for for your cultivation

1364
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,910
it's clean it's like growing a seat for

1365
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:44,260
the very first time ever so so it's

1366
00:54:42,909 --> 00:54:46,089
basically going to be through seed

1367
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,790
production and proper preservation of

1368
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:50,500
breeding practices in terms of keeping

1369
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:52,210
things preserved but also maintaining

1370
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,769
the diversity that's in the genetics

1371
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,869
which is a very long conversation and

1372
00:54:53,769 --> 00:54:58,239
then in terms of clones starting to work

1373
00:54:55,869 --> 00:54:59,589
with micro propagation applications so

1374
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:01,329
even if they're not going to be grown

1375
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:03,850
out you don't need to keep all these

1376
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:06,099
mothers around and we can start every

1377
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:07,420
year producing you know tissue culture

1378
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:09,400
mothers that start out with a clean

1379
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,599
slate there's someone in northern

1380
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,099
Humboldt that's been doing a lot of

1381
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:13,539
research on these pathogens and he

1382
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:15,909
showed me these graphs from field

1383
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:17,829
research starting in 2009 through the

1384
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:19,359
present time and he started with a few

1385
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:21,309
areas where he would you know test the

1386
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:24,039
tissue samples and basically you find

1387
00:55:21,309 --> 00:55:25,779
these stunted you know clones that

1388
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:27,219
basically take two or three weeks to get

1389
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:29,530
to get healthy to the point where you

1390
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:31,719
can actually grow them effectively and

1391
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:33,760
really talented growers find themselves

1392
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:35,009
out growing this virus out growing this

1393
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,980
pathogen by applying

1394
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:40,470
you know good beneficial microbiology

1395
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,630
and good sustainable organic soils and

1396
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:44,189
practices like that but it's still there

1397
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:46,650
when you get a clone from somebody back

1398
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:48,630
I don't know man like nine out of nine

1399
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:51,300
point nine nine nine out of ten times

1400
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:53,460
the clone has issues and so this guy's

1401
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:55,050
research has actually shown that he's

1402
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,420
discovered a virus and you can see on a

1403
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:59,760
graph we're starting in 2010 you know he

1404
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:02,250
found it on a few samples in 2011 he

1405
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:05,190
found more and then each year by 2012

1406
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:07,349
2013 it was in every single sample of

1407
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:08,849
tissue that he took from clones of

1408
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:11,099
cannabis plants from all around the

1409
00:56:08,849 --> 00:56:12,980
Emerald triangle between my area Island

1410
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:15,809
mountain all over Mendocino and Trinity

1411
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:18,179
so in terms of preservation I do think

1412
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:19,920
we need to we need to go to some greater

1413
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:21,960
minds from the scientific community and

1414
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,730
work collaboratively so that we don't

1415
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,289
lose clone genetics because anybody

1416
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:26,880
who's a grower or breeder in here has

1417
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:28,469
probably lost something special to them

1418
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,780
that you'll never get back like a last

1419
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:32,939
of the mohicans variety and it's really

1420
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:36,000
important for the future to be able to

1421
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:39,570
preserve that so I saw it be more fun to

1422
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,969
talk about weed and growing 100% thank

1423
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:43,500
you well we're we're kind of getting

1424
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:44,849
towards the end and I wanted to go ahead

1425
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,809
and open it up to the audience if you

1426
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:47,809
have questions shoot

1427
00:56:56,429 --> 00:57:26,848
but then opened up the conversation with

1428
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:30,990
my father-in-law can you repeat the

1429
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:32,760
question on so your question was legally

1430
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:39,689
what's the first step of protecting all

1431
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:43,609
those seeds you know that's a great

1432
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:46,679
question and I'm gonna start with this a

1433
00:57:43,608 --> 00:57:51,719
lot of people wonder if what they have

1434
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:54,960
is unique enough to protect and the the

1435
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:57,959
easiest answer is every single every

1436
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,568
single seed you ever plant is unique

1437
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:04,710
enough to protect just and that might

1438
00:58:00,568 --> 00:58:06,690
sound crazy but you know no matter how

1439
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:08,699
many children my parents had unless

1440
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:11,940
they're twins we're all different we're

1441
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:13,649
all unique enough to be different right

1442
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:19,559
to be protected well the question is are

1443
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:22,170
we worth protecting right and so the

1444
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:23,849
real question is if you have something

1445
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:25,889
that if you have a seat if you have a

1446
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:28,079
plant that you've grown up

1447
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:30,949
is it worth commercializing does it and

1448
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:33,089
not just is it going to be worth

1449
00:58:30,949 --> 00:58:35,939
commercializing for more than a few

1450
00:58:33,088 --> 00:58:37,349
seasons if it's gonna be worth

1451
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,940
commercializing for more than a few

1452
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:41,390
seasons then you want to protect it and

1453
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:44,190
then the question is are you likely to

1454
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:46,230
make your money selling clones selling

1455
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:48,539
seeds or just selling harvested material

1456
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:51,150
if you're gonna sell flour and you're

1457
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:53,099
never ever gonna need to sell plants so

1458
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:56,639
never sell any kind of propagating

1459
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:58,680
material you could if you were positive

1460
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,048
that no genetic material would ever slip

1461
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:03,179
out of your control you wouldn't even

1462
00:59:01,048 --> 00:59:04,920
need intellectual property protection of

1463
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:06,659
course nobody's ever positive that's

1464
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,789
going to happen but if you're if you're

1465
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:10,059
never selling clones or seeds the best

1466
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:11,860
thing to do the

1467
00:59:10,059 --> 00:59:14,380
easiest cheapest thing to do is get a

1468
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:17,110
plant patent that's like a copyright on

1469
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:19,599
a plant it's it's really not that hard

1470
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:21,099
to get you don't have to have DNA you

1471
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,170
don't have to have a whole lot to get

1472
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:26,139
started you need a couple photos of the

1473
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:30,900
plant you need a name that isn't your

1474
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:34,269
trademark name what's the cost on that

1475
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:36,340
to get started it cost

1476
00:59:34,269 --> 00:59:38,380
I don't yeah that's that's so it's

1477
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:39,970
likely not worth the cost currently what

1478
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,710
what I would recommend that you guys do

1479
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:44,319
if it's important as a family heirloom

1480
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:45,940
grow it out and do an open pollination

1481
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,100
and make the next generation of seeds

1482
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:49,750
but do the whole thing all the males all

1483
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:51,849
the females call out the weaker ones

1484
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:53,949
that way you have it and as your family

1485
00:59:51,849 --> 00:59:55,719
continues to grow it and if it's special

1486
00:59:53,949 --> 00:59:58,000
to you and you keep it preserved over

1487
00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:00,579
time the the need and value to protect

1488
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,500
IP will come that'll happen if you prove

1489
01:00:00,579 --> 01:00:05,049
it in market but if it's just sacred for

1490
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:07,119
your family open pollinated preserve it

1491
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:08,530
store those seeds properly do it before

1492
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,449
it's too late and you can't get them to

1493
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:12,580
germinate maybe take some clone

1494
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:15,339
selections and we've all lost stuff due

1495
01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:16,569
to human error you know it's like man if

1496
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,519
you want something right do it yourself

1497
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:20,740
but but that's what I would say keep it

1498
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:22,570
within your family reproduce those seeds

1499
01:00:20,739 --> 01:00:24,639
so you have the next generation open

1500
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:26,350
pollinate you know call out any of the

1501
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:28,359
weaker plants and then if it proves

1502
01:00:26,349 --> 01:00:29,769
value in the market at some point when

1503
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,370
people are starting to come for you to

1504
01:00:29,769 --> 01:00:32,769
find it

1505
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:35,049
then talk to some lawyers then look into

1506
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:39,670
protecting the IP it's it's too early to

1507
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:41,620
do that and I completely agree you don't

1508
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:43,030
want to spend money on IP until you know

1509
01:00:41,619 --> 01:00:47,710
that you've got something valuable the

1510
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:49,330
only thing is if you're losing control

1511
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,949
of if you're losing control of the

1512
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:53,409
genetics that's when you it may already

1513
01:00:50,949 --> 01:00:55,599
be too late just just be careful about

1514
01:00:53,409 --> 01:00:57,789
that part can you own I have the next

1515
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:00,039
question because it's he late how can

1516
01:00:57,789 --> 01:01:02,400
you patent a plant that she's on

1517
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:05,199
schedule one

1518
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:08,139
they didn't can get the last part out

1519
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:11,829
can you patent a plant that is on

1520
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:13,569
schedule one ah this is great the US

1521
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:16,509
Patent and Trademark Office is not

1522
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:18,580
concerned at all about legality or even

1523
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:21,850
safety they leave that to other agencies

1524
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:23,319
they've been granting patents on illegal

1525
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:26,980
and unsafe things that

1526
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:28,750
throughout their entire history so great

1527
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:30,760
news with plant patents it's kind of

1528
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:32,050
like bleep patents is like this all

1529
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,030
right here's the real deal like if

1530
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:35,740
you're a grower it's like who can own a

1531
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,870
plant you know it's like that's how I

1532
01:01:35,739 --> 01:01:39,729
feel about you know all of this stuff

1533
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:42,190
it's like what is your entitlement to

1534
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:43,960
owning this like when I first owned land

1535
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:46,420
I never thought that I would so I was

1536
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,889
like man I own this land and then I went

1537
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:50,019
to and I stood there and I go I don't

1538
01:01:47,889 --> 01:01:51,069
own this land you can't own a light you

1539
01:01:50,019 --> 01:01:53,320
can't own land

1540
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,970
you know it's my job to steward preserve

1541
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,860
it but just like like the Native

1542
01:01:54,969 --> 01:01:58,209
Americans and in you know cultures

1543
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:00,309
throughout civilization it's like if

1544
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:02,079
it's part of nature can we really own it

1545
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:03,579
and then as you start to create and

1546
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:05,590
adapt things that are more unique to you

1547
01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:07,329
that you've put effort into then you

1548
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:09,250
start getting there but I just think

1549
01:02:07,329 --> 01:02:11,230
with Platt you know with patenting stuff

1550
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:13,869
I mean it's like I said all of this is a

1551
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:16,059
new intense discussion you know but I

1552
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:18,039
think it's too early for cannabis and

1553
01:02:16,059 --> 01:02:19,869
unless it's really proving an

1554
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:22,360
application and market and there's a

1555
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:25,449
risk of it being infringed on I'm gonna

1556
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:27,820
respectfully just point out that people

1557
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:29,799
you don't own land because that land is

1558
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:32,350
gonna be there long after you're gone

1559
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:34,780
but people do build fences around their

1560
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:37,420
land they stop people from building

1561
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:38,860
roads across their land they stop people

1562
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,630
from moving on to their land that's

1563
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:44,920
exactly what a patent is a boundary

1564
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:46,720
around what you've created so that

1565
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,480
you're free to do what you want to do

1566
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:52,149
with what you've created and you can you

1567
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:55,030
can allow people to come onto your land

1568
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:57,190
and to even live on it to have parties

1569
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:58,480
on it whatever but if you don't exert

1570
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:02,019
control over your land it's not your

1571
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:06,099
land anymore by the same token if you

1572
01:03:02,019 --> 01:03:07,139
create some great variety you're free to

1573
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:11,139
do what you want with it

1574
01:03:07,139 --> 01:03:12,879
but as soon as you utterly lose control

1575
01:03:11,139 --> 01:03:15,670
of that it's not really yours to decide

1576
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:18,070
anymore and if you get a patent and I'm

1577
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:20,260
not absolutely there most things that

1578
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:21,880
are ever created are not worth patenting

1579
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:23,470
but if you ever have something that

1580
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,670
really is worth patenting and you don't

1581
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:27,519
patent it you will lose your opportunity

1582
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:30,970
to be the one that controls its destiny

1583
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:33,039
is fate so that's like not putting a

1584
01:03:30,969 --> 01:03:34,619
fence around your land I'm gonna thread

1585
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,639
a middle line here if I

1586
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:38,440
while you're in the middle I think we

1587
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:40,539
need to prevent other people from

1588
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,579
patenting your stepfather I think

1589
01:03:40,539 --> 01:03:44,639
happens to be the source of my family's

1590
01:03:42,579 --> 01:03:47,349
afghani from from several decades ago

1591
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:50,079
coincidentally not two we grew up very

1592
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:52,329
close to one another and so I think we

1593
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,880
need to stop somebody else from saying

1594
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:57,309
no this is mine you can't have it we

1595
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,960
need a way I mean and I'm obviously a

1596
01:03:57,309 --> 01:04:01,869
broken record I'm really good at getting

1597
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,309
into obsessive obsessive grooves and my

1598
01:04:01,869 --> 01:04:06,279
obsessive groove currently is

1599
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:08,349
cooperative cooperative ownership we I

1600
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:10,930
agree we can't no nature it's a silly

1601
01:04:08,349 --> 01:04:13,750
concept it's part of why things are so

1602
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:16,079
screwy in the world today we need to do

1603
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:18,280
a better job of asserting our

1604
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,119
responsibility to these varieties

1605
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:25,660
varietals and our guardianship of them

1606
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:27,789
actually owning it is very costly and

1607
01:04:25,659 --> 01:04:30,190
agree entirely with both of them that

1608
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:32,349
like it's too soon we don't know but to

1609
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:34,840
start establishing benchmarks and lines

1610
01:04:32,349 --> 01:04:36,819
in the sand around these shared assets

1611
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:39,760
around these things that these

1612
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:41,710
courageous heroes brought to us from you

1613
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:45,520
know these land rate like this is a very

1614
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:47,470
real community asset and and figuring

1615
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:50,199
out where to set the balance between the

1616
01:04:47,469 --> 01:04:51,819
individual and the community and you

1617
01:04:50,199 --> 01:04:53,919
know to sort of Frenchie's opening

1618
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,690
comments it's not just the farmer it's

1619
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:02,530
the community around the farmer and that

1620
01:04:55,690 --> 01:05:04,269
to me is why I'm a broker so what he

1621
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:06,880
said I think was really really valuable

1622
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:08,199
information is the main purpose of why

1623
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,550
people should protect us who's gonna

1624
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:11,589
steal it from you and who's gonna take

1625
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,300
it from you and you're really correct on

1626
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:14,410
that because so you know the guy who

1627
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,510
didn't show up today and all the

1628
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:17,769
controversy with that I was really

1629
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:19,330
hoping he was going to show up I was

1630
01:05:17,769 --> 01:05:21,190
gonna be very respectful but I was gonna

1631
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:23,559
really drop some some knowledge for sure

1632
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:25,599
and so the deal is the roots of that go

1633
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:27,039
very deep this didn't just happen with

1634
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:28,059
this Philo's thing in the last six

1635
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,639
months or in the last year that

1636
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:34,210
organization in that entity started in

1637
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:34,809
2009 2010 they had Robert Clark and Sam

1638
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:37,260
the skunkman

1639
01:05:34,809 --> 01:05:39,759
went on to these online forums of

1640
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:41,500
cultivators and started asking to

1641
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,410
collect people's genetic specimens of

1642
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:46,000
landrace local varietals even in seed

1643
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:47,589
form that they thought couldn't

1644
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,960
germinate they still wanted that for

1645
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,240
what they

1646
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:52,190
calling a worldwide classification

1647
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:53,989
program and this is all documented you

1648
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:55,369
can find it all online so Philo's was

1649
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:58,338
involved in all of this back in the day

1650
01:05:55,369 --> 01:06:00,019
and then my question was who's paying

1651
01:05:58,338 --> 01:06:01,820
for this because this is some really

1652
01:06:00,019 --> 01:06:03,949
forward-thinking technology so who's

1653
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:05,690
who's putting up the money for that and

1654
01:06:03,949 --> 01:06:07,039
if you really start diving I mean I

1655
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:08,358
don't care that much but if you really

1656
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,670
look into it there's ties between

1657
01:06:08,358 --> 01:06:12,889
executives at GW Pharmaceuticals to that

1658
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:14,990
whole structure of entities at that time

1659
01:06:12,889 --> 01:06:16,789
that was really ahead of everyone being

1660
01:06:14,989 --> 01:06:18,858
like look let's just get as much genetic

1661
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:20,719
information as we can into our pockets

1662
01:06:18,858 --> 01:06:22,880
so that we can hopefully be the ones to

1663
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:24,799
start adapting biopharmaceutical

1664
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,940
products because that's the the whole

1665
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,410
thing when you think about the forward

1666
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,820
future of the industry we are gonna

1667
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:30,879
learn certain cannabinoids and

1668
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,880
terpenoids

1669
01:06:31,369 --> 01:06:34,880
might cure diseases they might have

1670
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:37,449
incredible medical applications that can

1671
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:40,070
better humanity but it's going to be

1672
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:42,108
biopharmaceutical geoengineering that's

1673
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:44,359
those are the companies who have the

1674
01:06:42,108 --> 01:06:46,549
applications the ability to do that and

1675
01:06:44,358 --> 01:06:48,079
so it's just it's a very mixed thing

1676
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:50,300
about I feel the emotions but in terms

1677
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,338
of people who want our genetics all of

1678
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:54,950
the biggest agricultural companies in

1679
01:06:52,338 --> 01:06:57,679
the entire world Bayer SCI genta

1680
01:06:54,949 --> 01:06:59,629
Monsanto Cargill every one of them you

1681
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:01,639
know when people talk about Omar Abreu

1682
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:03,500
Philip Morris is buying up land people

1683
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:04,730
talked about that 20 years ago and they

1684
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,019
were probably doing it it's not a

1685
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:08,030
conspiracy they're smart

1686
01:07:06,019 --> 01:07:09,409
forward-thinking massive conglomerates

1687
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:11,980
that can crawl control the whole world

1688
01:07:09,409 --> 01:07:14,299
you know on some conspiracy stuff so

1689
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:16,789
that is what we do need to protect

1690
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:18,230
ourselves from and it's like those

1691
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:20,210
people are coming into this industry

1692
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:21,800
they're doing it they've been doing it

1693
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:23,659
they've been doing it for over a decade

1694
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:26,210
they were smart and they stayed real

1695
01:07:23,659 --> 01:07:27,799
silent now some of it is bubbling up but

1696
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:29,809
who knows where they've been in

1697
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:33,500
investing and figuring out and then the

1698
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:35,509
thing is can growers like us can we do

1699
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:37,219
all that stuff without joining them

1700
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:38,900
because it's like you don't want to join

1701
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,909
them if you can't beat them do you have

1702
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:42,950
to join them we don't know yet but it

1703
01:07:40,909 --> 01:07:44,629
that's that's the conversation in terms

1704
01:07:42,949 --> 01:07:46,069
of protecting our genetics which was

1705
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:47,450
really smart it's like it's too early

1706
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:49,220
for us to go there we don't have the

1707
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:51,858
funds but we need to make sure that

1708
01:07:49,219 --> 01:07:53,358
someone else doesn't steal your family's

1709
01:07:51,858 --> 01:07:56,440
life's work because there's people

1710
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:56,440
already trying to do things like that

1711
01:07:56,659 --> 01:08:01,259
thank you I appreciate it okay so let's

1712
01:08:00,088 --> 01:08:17,548
take another question from the audience

1713
01:08:01,259 --> 01:08:20,850
and let's go with Frank the only way to

1714
01:08:17,548 --> 01:08:22,859
really please paraphrase the question

1715
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:25,020
for the video folks um is there a way to

1716
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:27,600
collectively or broken record

1717
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:31,319
cooperatively owned a seed and genetics

1718
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:35,489
Bank is like if silo I put all the data

1719
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:38,400
they had taken from everything that was

1720
01:08:35,488 --> 01:08:43,588
given to you available for the public

1721
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:45,960
then it's okay to share but everybody

1722
01:08:43,588 --> 01:08:48,838
has access to it then it's really

1723
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:52,259
worthwhile because like like a they can

1724
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:55,229
say it's and usage way that plot is way

1725
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:58,920
beyond possessing it while you need to

1726
01:08:55,229 --> 01:09:02,428
protect your yourself so dealing with an

1727
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,679
OTT that puts it available to the public

1728
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:07,289
it's a big deal I take it personally

1729
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:11,670
because Robert clouds that I respect a

1730
01:09:07,289 --> 01:09:16,500
lot asked me to ask you to give sample

1731
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:19,829
Sam's or skunk man sent me GM personally

1732
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:23,250
to ask you Mowgli ask me to ask you

1733
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:27,088
personally and I love you to death and I

1734
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:31,020
need you like nobody else but I cannot

1735
01:09:27,088 --> 01:09:33,568
give I cannot touch to that level it's

1736
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:36,480
like I cannot give my world and take

1737
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:39,449
something from you that I know it is so

1738
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:42,658
precious and give it to an OTT when I'm

1739
01:09:39,448 --> 01:09:48,000
not sure that those data are available

1740
01:09:42,658 --> 01:09:51,028
for everybody but yes there absolutely

1741
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,639
is it wasn't a planted question I swear

1742
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:55,350
but it might as well have been our dear

1743
01:09:53,639 --> 01:09:57,539
colleague Casey isn't here he had a

1744
01:09:55,350 --> 01:10:00,090
wedding to go to but you know one of the

1745
01:09:57,539 --> 01:10:02,189
first things that Casey did back in 2014

1746
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:03,989
with Emerald grown we're a mutual

1747
01:10:02,189 --> 01:10:05,848
benefit meaning all of our assets can

1748
01:10:03,988 --> 01:10:08,069
only be used for the common benefit of

1749
01:10:05,849 --> 01:10:09,100
all of the memory members was start a

1750
01:10:08,069 --> 01:10:11,710
seed bank and

1751
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:14,050
free open swap and exchange seedbank it

1752
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:15,640
has been a tough time for growers the

1753
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:17,199
last couple years we've been about as

1754
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,910
spread thin as we can be

1755
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:20,769
I think we're turning the corner on that

1756
01:10:18,909 --> 01:10:22,659
and I think we're moving into a new era

1757
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:24,480
where we will have the capacity to

1758
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:26,380
formalize some of these institutions

1759
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:28,929
looking forward to talking to the

1760
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:31,210
colleague here about how those types of

1761
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:33,850
cooperative ownership structures might

1762
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:36,310
help serve us but but making sure that

1763
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:39,010
our community protects our common assets

1764
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:40,780
from the oncoming threats is I think the

1765
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:43,360
bottom line and your question is spot-on

1766
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:45,099
yes there is a way to structure that yes

1767
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:47,679
there is a way to do that I think it's

1768
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:51,940
really important that it's possible to

1769
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:55,210
collectivise individual IP assets and

1770
01:10:51,939 --> 01:10:57,819
put them into a pool that can be

1771
01:10:55,210 --> 01:11:00,670
asserted as a defense if anybody gets

1772
01:10:57,819 --> 01:11:04,989
taken on by big AG that the collective

1773
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:08,859
could kind of form a counterbalance and

1774
01:11:04,989 --> 01:11:10,630
I think that's an important yeah I think

1775
01:11:08,859 --> 01:11:11,859
that's a really excellent point and you

1776
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:14,409
know to your point around trade

1777
01:11:11,859 --> 01:11:16,239
associations I think you know just like

1778
01:11:14,409 --> 01:11:19,619
any partnership right if you're working

1779
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:21,550
with a company you're working with an

1780
01:11:19,619 --> 01:11:22,329
institution you're working with trade

1781
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:25,060
associations

1782
01:11:22,329 --> 01:11:28,090
it's about standards right standards of

1783
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:29,800
how we do business standards of what our

1784
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:31,539
agreements are and I think it's up to

1785
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,520
all of us to do our due diligence and

1786
01:11:31,539 --> 01:11:35,439
really follow the money you know where

1787
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:39,340
is the money coming from how are we

1788
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:41,079
evaluating this data moving forward and

1789
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:42,610
and how is that piece coming back to the

1790
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:45,100
community and so I think that is

1791
01:11:42,609 --> 01:11:47,199
everyone's individual job to really do

1792
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:49,390
that due diligence and really look at

1793
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:51,519
you know who we're partnering with and

1794
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:54,010
really what are what are the tools were

1795
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,230
working with and where's the balance of

1796
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:59,650
how we're exchanging resources in that

1797
01:11:56,229 --> 01:12:04,179
context so we're about 20 minutes over

1798
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:05,739
time and so we're down is we're down to

1799
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:07,869
keep going no one's telling us to get

1800
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:10,289
out of here so let's go ahead and with

1801
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:10,289
one more question

1802
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:14,269
[Music]

1803
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,989
[Music]

1804
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:33,199
[Applause]

1805
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:33,199
[Music]

1806
01:12:37,329 --> 01:12:40,368
[Music]

1807
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:48,310
they know everything

1808
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:50,940
what are they gonna do with that data

1809
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:50,940
all these things

1810
01:13:03,408 --> 01:13:16,429
he's got pushing up there okay yeah but

1811
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:19,130
it's also important in your real health

1812
01:13:16,429 --> 01:13:21,590
I think we need the looking of

1813
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:23,929
participatory plant breeding programs

1814
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:26,449
there's a lot of data on this there's a

1815
01:13:23,929 --> 01:13:30,319
lot of information out there look it up

1816
01:13:26,448 --> 01:13:32,569
kitv's or awesome we need the farmers

1817
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:35,539
association the farmers to get together

1818
01:13:32,569 --> 01:13:37,819
with the Appalachian groups we need

1819
01:13:35,539 --> 01:13:40,279
those cultivars that you've got to get

1820
01:13:37,819 --> 01:13:43,698
in and protected in the appellations of

1821
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:45,590
origin as our cultivars as historical

1822
01:13:43,698 --> 01:13:47,960
representations of what we're trying to

1823
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:50,090
prevent even if we can't get it into the

1824
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:52,850
patent system and even if that's not

1825
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:56,029
necessarily the greatest value added or

1826
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:58,130
you know money proposition we need to

1827
01:13:56,029 --> 01:14:01,189
figure out multiple strategies that

1828
01:13:58,130 --> 01:14:04,369
start with farmers working with local

1829
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:07,638
breeders collecting all that data and

1830
01:14:04,369 --> 01:14:10,760
using our local trade associations and

1831
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:13,159
like all this we need to get over

1832
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,860
differences like there's all sorts of

1833
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:19,519
camps going back decades in the cannabis

1834
01:14:15,859 --> 01:14:23,000
world we fight incessantly and we got to

1835
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:25,630
get over that shit because sales article

1836
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,630
was incredible

1837
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:29,009
[Applause]

1838
01:14:31,489 --> 01:14:37,219
[Applause]

1839
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:56,528
[Music]

1840
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:08,099
[Music]

1841
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:31,939
[Music]

1842
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:38,000
[Applause]

1843
01:15:31,939 --> 01:15:39,439
I agree yeah she was man it's a lot of

1844
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,260
it's a lot of question but she was

1845
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:44,750
saying you know how can we develop those

1846
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:47,780
processes of getting the communities and

1847
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:49,460
the farms together with some of the some

1848
01:15:47,779 --> 01:15:51,859
of the organizations or companies that

1849
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:53,600
actually have the resources or assets to

1850
01:15:51,859 --> 01:15:56,119
help collect all this data and use it

1851
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,130
responsibly to benefit everyone in the

1852
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:59,569
right ways with positive intentions and

1853
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:01,220
I think it's already happening this

1854
01:15:59,569 --> 01:16:02,960
discussion is a part of this your

1855
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:04,520
organization which is done really

1856
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,350
amazing work and come up into my

1857
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:08,570
neighborhood and gotten people to show

1858
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:10,430
up at the firehouse who like would never

1859
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:12,590
even consider showing up at a meeting

1860
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:13,970
like that so it's it's about dialogue

1861
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:15,079
reaching out to each other and

1862
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:17,510
connecting and that's the thing about

1863
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:19,880
weed is like weed culture used to be

1864
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:21,409
like you had to be down now everybody

1865
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:25,130
thinks they're in it and they're not you

1866
01:16:21,409 --> 01:16:26,329
know so it's a it's definitely about a

1867
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:28,220
dialogue the folks who have the

1868
01:16:26,329 --> 01:16:30,439
resources and the assets need to reach

1869
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:32,270
out to the communities or the leaders of

1870
01:16:30,439 --> 01:16:33,679
those communities you know and and

1871
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:35,810
that's it man it's a dialogue a

1872
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:38,600
discussion and starting more meetings in

1873
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:40,820
organizations because that's one of my

1874
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,440
missions there's so much crazy cool sea

1875
01:16:40,819 --> 01:16:44,119
genetics that I you know haven't even

1876
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:45,139
seen people produce in five or six years

1877
01:16:44,119 --> 01:16:47,569
and all these people that have these

1878
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:49,520
collections and I want to see those come

1879
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:51,559
back into the light I want people to see

1880
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,050
the amazing terpenes that they've never

1881
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,180
experienced so so you're right that has

1882
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:58,670
to happen I think it already is and it's

1883
01:16:56,180 --> 01:17:02,030
just encouraging people to collaborate

1884
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:03,890
and and you know and be selfless in

1885
01:17:02,029 --> 01:17:05,840
terms of like let's just have more

1886
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:08,300
conversations like this so there's two

1887
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,340
really firm strategies and two things we

1888
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:12,529
need to be absolutely mindful of in my

1889
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:14,750
opinion first and foremost the reason

1890
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:16,340
the appellation law notes varietal is

1891
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:19,970
because the intention is to document

1892
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:22,850
catalog and snapshot where we are now in

1893
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:26,329
the public record that is a public asset

1894
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:28,100
you can't undo that document and library

1895
01:17:26,329 --> 01:17:31,460
except sort of maybe Elinor it might

1896
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:33,620
correct me which okay so first and

1897
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:36,279
foremost public if it is a public

1898
01:17:33,619 --> 01:17:39,019
institution it is for the public benefit

1899
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:40,880
secondly ownership and control how the

1900
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:43,910
company is structured a private company

1901
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,560
can and will liquidate assets if you the

1902
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:48,649
farmers don't own the

1903
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:50,630
Bini in part it's probably not going to

1904
01:17:48,649 --> 01:17:53,629
have your interests in heart at the end

1905
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:55,609
of the day and so obviously the farmers

1906
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:58,039
don't have the capital structuring

1907
01:17:55,609 --> 01:18:00,170
partnerships very very carefully between

1908
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:03,019
farmer and financier is a way to move

1909
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:05,569
forward but if the bottom line communal

1910
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:07,940
farmer ownership doesn't exist it's

1911
01:18:05,569 --> 01:18:10,489
probably not a good strategy so public

1912
01:18:07,939 --> 01:18:12,979
ownership farmer ownership cooperative

1913
01:18:10,489 --> 01:18:15,439
shared ownership are very important

1914
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:19,309
strategies and structures to to really

1915
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:23,869
like trust at the end of the day back it

1916
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:26,780
up and and then you want eco nation

1917
01:18:23,869 --> 01:18:30,500
because when what you give us

1918
01:18:26,779 --> 01:18:34,279
extractor everybody in the industry what

1919
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:38,239
we receive we owe it to you if you don't

1920
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:40,309
receive credit for what you give us it

1921
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:43,670
doesn't work you need to be able to

1922
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:46,490
create a market where the credit is

1923
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:49,850
given back to the origin of the product

1924
01:18:46,489 --> 01:18:53,539
and must extract oil if you do a red pen

1925
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:58,310
and yeah you want to do big number but

1926
01:18:53,539 --> 01:19:01,220
when you buy your biomass in Salinas or

1927
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:01,789
when you buy your biomass in mandu or

1928
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:06,170
ambled

1929
01:19:01,789 --> 01:19:09,260
it's not quite the same it's not quite

1930
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:13,550
the same biomass and because you have a

1931
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:17,360
world recognition you have to walk this

1932
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:19,820
you so won't know that you go the best

1933
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:22,819
you you need to be aware of that when

1934
01:19:19,819 --> 01:19:25,340
you sell your product already you sell

1935
01:19:22,819 --> 01:19:27,920
it to chip but on top of it they don't

1936
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:31,279
give you credit for the quality that

1937
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:35,180
they recognize for is that you need at

1938
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:37,399
least to ask for your name on the

1939
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:39,710
packaging you don't care if it of a pen

1940
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:42,559
you don't care if it's a chocolate you

1941
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:46,189
don't care whatever it comes from your

1942
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:50,289
farm and that name on the packaging is

1943
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:53,719
actually promotion and marketing

1944
01:19:50,289 --> 01:19:57,380
worldwide power for all those companies

1945
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:59,389
that feed on you so it's like it's you

1946
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:02,779
need to protect yourself but you

1947
01:19:59,389 --> 01:20:05,929
to be aware of the value of what you

1948
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:08,380
protect and there is no deal that not

1949
01:20:05,929 --> 01:20:11,810
get doesn't give you credit back because

1950
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:14,420
you use a center of that new and just

1951
