2
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,109
we is are here today just to kind of

3
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:22,890
discuss what we're seeing in the way of

4
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:24,660
what's happening in canvas-based

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,210
business and you know what we're seeing

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,559
in the way of valuations and M&amp;A

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,719
activity they're happening in canvas so

8
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,829
Jay what do you what do you see me now

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,058
what are your clients telling you what

10
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,629
kind of the bigger challenges you're

11
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:39,119
seeing from your client base Thanks um

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:41,359
so we're seeing a ton things are moving

13
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:45,000
super quickly and kind of in different

14
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,469
paces across the state so Los Angeles is

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,750
still kind of this laggard in terms of

16
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,429
getting people like really licensed but

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,869
then we see I think yesterday or two

18
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:53,549
days ago in San Francisco some of the

19
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:55,859
big marquee dispensaries are sold for

20
00:00:53,549 --> 00:01:00,599
nine fingers like maybe 120 million

21
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:02,250
dollars one of the challenges I think my

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,469
clients face all the time is they see

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,510
big marquee transactions like that they

24
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,908
see in the news that somebody is sold

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,118
for 120 million dollars and they think

26
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,010
there need to redo what they're doing

27
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:15,989
they need to revisit a term sheet they

28
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,420
need to hold the phone on some deal

29
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:20,579
that's in progress we can't see all most

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,340
deals getting disrupted when they see

31
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,959
other good deals you've kind of seen the

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,960
ripple effects of some of these big

33
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,399
transactions yeah largest seeing a lot

34
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,750
of the same things the problem that

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,340
we're watching right now is the lot of

36
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,250
these transactions aren't being done as

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,930
cash transactions most of the buyers are

38
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,099
offering it's it's usually publicly

39
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,049
traded companies they're coming and

40
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,699
they're offering what are called 2080

41
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,710
deals for 20 percent in cash and 80

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,149
percent in stock in the stock then has

43
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,789
some sort of lockup period attached to

44
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,899
it oftentimes over multiples of years

45
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,880
and then often times you know you've got

46
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,460
no ability to to mitigate a sort of

47
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,500
downside risk on that stock component so

48
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:59,009
what's been you know difficult for for

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,328
the clients I've had is as they take a

50
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,040
look at the offers are being made to

51
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,478
them follow the cash offer over here in

52
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,859
the cash offer let's let's call it a

53
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:06,420
twenty million dollar offer and then the

54
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,530
other side they've got a an offer that

55
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,848
looks like it's a fifty million dollar

56
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,348
offer but really it's ten million in

57
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:11,689
cash in forty million in downstream

58
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,759
stock

59
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:14,960
so it you know you don't know what's

60
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,879
gonna happen to the 40 million dollar

61
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,260
stock component to it in many ways the

62
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,120
20 million dollars a better deal but

63
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:21,500
they start thinking we're worth 50 and

64
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,539
more importantly if one else around them

65
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,780
thinks they're worth 50 yeah if you had

66
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:27,500
somebody come to you in that situation

67
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,990
everybody's seen these Canadian

68
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,090
businesses just their valuations just

69
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,560
kind of go bananas and I used to work in

70
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,450
Silicon Valley where we're kind of used

71
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,479
to seeing things go bananas and then

72
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:41,599
come back to sanity how would you tell

73
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,419
somebody to think about the value of the

74
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:49,430
stock that they're being offered right

75
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:50,869
like it doesn't when we talk to them

76
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,280
about it and first of all we're not sure

77
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,330
for you know completely in bubble

78
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,890
territory or whether we've already

79
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,840
reached like to a whole territory at

80
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,219
this point so you know in many ways I

81
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,509
look at a lot of these valuations and I

82
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,979
think they aren't defensible I mean you

83
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:02,929
look at like where can be until rare and

84
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:04,789
it's not just a multiple to earnings

85
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,310
it's you know they're trading at 300

86
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:08,389
times revenue which is you know a number

87
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,030
that we didn't even see in tech or

88
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,709
telecom so it's almost impossible to

89
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,629
give these guys the the belief that this

90
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,060
thing's gonna stay is as high as it is

91
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,590
but right now because you've got you

92
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,090
know a lot of out of industry Wall

93
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,099
Street capital pouring into some of the

94
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,110
Canadian banks to fund these things

95
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,239
because they see the Canadian market as

96
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,590
being the safest place to invest they're

97
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,180
starting to feel some comfort there

98
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,650
which means it's validating these other

99
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,420
market caps and other people are coming

100
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,340
out or getting the same thing the

101
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:35,869
problem is that when the blue sky ends

102
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,159
and in fundamentals start kicking in

103
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,509
there's absolutely no way they can

104
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,919
sustain even if they continue to acquire

105
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,209
other people's balance sheets which is

106
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,219
you know as we're talking about earlier

107
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,509
what they're doing right now so when I

108
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:47,120
speak to clients about this you know

109
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:48,739
what I try to advise them is don't look

110
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,879
at the stock component if you are going

111
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:51,709
to look at it you know think about from

112
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,569
the perspective of all right how do i

113
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,219
medicate that stock component against

114
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:57,469
any downside risk like how do i you know

115
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,449
put a recalc in there so that you know

116
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:00,769
should I come off restriction the shares

117
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,849
have lost you know eighty percent of

118
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:03,080
their value between the time of the

119
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:05,359
acquisition happen in the time that they

120
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,760
actually become freely tradable for me

121
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,110
how do I say to the the purchaser you

122
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,370
know look we need to put something in

123
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,230
there that says should you lose X

124
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,789
personas value we want to have a

125
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,959
recalculation that brings us back up to

126
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:16,699
the total consideration that we were

127
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,829
promised in the first place yeah and I

128
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:20,449
think I see we see folks trying to

129
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,060
negotiate things like collars trying to

130
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:24,409
negotiate some kind of you know you say

131
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,560
it's going to be 50 million dollars in

132
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,030
stock well it needs to be

133
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,329
twenty forty and sixty that it needs to

134
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:32,429
have some grounding I think we see a lot

135
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:34,560
of the Canadian buyers really just

136
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:39,240
interested in that because they know

137
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,370
that their shares are crazily valued and

138
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,439
they really want all that risk to kind

139
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,120
of be on the seller they want the

140
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:51,839
dispensary other small company to kind

141
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:54,180
of live with that I think that I try and

142
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,479
tell clients sometimes if you had ten

143
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,699
million dollars would you buy ten

144
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,689
million dollars of canopy stock or ten

145
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,668
million dollars of whatever

146
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:04,769
Canadian company stock and usually they

147
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:05,879
think no if they had ten million dollars

148
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:09,060
that's not what they would do with it

149
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,699
and canopies great this isn't about

150
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,699
canopy but I feel like the when they

151
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:17,310
think about it that way they it becomes

152
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,990
real dollars right and at first we just

153
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,519
say I'll give you twenty million dollars

154
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,660
in stock and ten milligrams in cash it

155
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:26,370
seems like infinite but when you ask

156
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,189
them what do you want to invest in this

157
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,680
business they think twice

158
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:33,089
I go step past that and ask them you

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,129
know if you had that same money would

160
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:36,209
you buy yourself at this valuation yeah

161
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:37,350
do you really think that your business

162
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:39,359
is worth that much when you see these

163
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,710
other evaluations when you know I often

164
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,629
hear this like so and so just got bought

165
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:44,849
for 50 million that's crazy and you're

166
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:46,620
like yeah that's that's crazy you know

167
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,000
it's so you can't say that's crazy and

168
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,439
then I expect to have that as well

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
because the two things are in congruous

170
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,810
you know you need to make sure that

171
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,668
they're thinking about from the

172
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,490
perspective you know fundamentally what

173
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:57,000
are you worth and what's defensible

174
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,079
especially when you're thinking that a

175
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,970
lot of the transactions they're

176
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,009
comparing to are the ones have a public

177
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,389
stock component to it but when they're

178
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:05,219
raising capital they're still raising

179
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:07,050
capital with with private money it's

180
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,430
there is no stock component so you have

181
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,228
to say okay you know even if this other

182
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,340
company breezed at X and you know

183
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:13,139
because there it was an acquisition

184
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:14,638
where they actually were bought was

185
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,160
stock if you're out there trying to

186
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,329
raise ten million in growth capital and

187
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,950
you're trying to do a devaluation you

188
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:22,199
can't peg your valuation against their

189
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,930
valuation simply because it's a it's an

190
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,759
apples and oranges situation so if

191
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,259
somebody came to you and said you know

192
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,668
there's an offer to sell but there's

193
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,209
also an opportunity to grow the business

194
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:37,079
for a couple of more years would your

195
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:38,479
answer vary if they were a retailer or

196
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,639
manufacturer or

197
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,560
the distributor or do you think either

198
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:47,769
one of them should kind of make the same

199
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,790
sorts of decisions I would further

200
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:51,259
categorize away past that and say what

201
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,150
mark are you in you know what state are

202
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:55,069
you located in you know if it's an

203
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:56,569
oligopoly state like in New York or in

204
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:57,889
New Jersey or Connecticut where you've

205
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,180
got you know a golden ticket and you

206
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,279
know you can grow the business and very

207
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,930
likely the state's not going to you know

208
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,000
create some sort of an environment with

209
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,319
with new entrants in the marketplace and

210
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,879
everyone that's already in it has a

211
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,680
really strong Lobby to protect market

212
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,139
share there I'd certainly encourage them

213
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,120
to continue to grow rather than try it

214
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,620
sell right now but in a state you know

215
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,180
like California where you know that

216
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,910
let's say you know Los Angeles is a comp

217
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,650
set it's going to go from 135 pre ICO

218
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,270
companies to significantly more over the

219
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,409
next couple of years yeah if someone's

220
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:26,240
offering to buy you for you know

221
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,530
ridiculous valuation right now I would

222
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,040
say go ahead and sell it make sure you

223
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:32,239
don't sign a non-compete and turn around

224
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,220
and do it again as soon as you get the

225
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,540
chance to get a new license because you

226
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,610
know the markets are completely

227
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,439
different yeah and I think that when you

228
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,139
look at based on the Oh retailer versus

229
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:44,060
processor versus cultivator again it

230
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,500
completely depends you know if I were if

231
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,970
I were an indoor warehouse right now in

232
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,259
LA and someone offered me money I'd sell

233
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,090
in a heartbeat because the whole markets

234
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,349
moving towards mix like green house you

235
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:52,969
know there's there's no reason to be an

236
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,080
indoor grower anymore and most states

237
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,210
that have indoor growers you know

238
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,219
ultimately they're it's a failing

239
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,199
business model so you know how do you

240
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,090
actually be the lowest cost producer at

241
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,039
the highest quality and if you're not

242
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:06,109
that then you know you're largely

243
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,629
wasting your time long term and if you

244
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,150
got near-term exit take it yeah I think

245
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:13,219
we see I used to work up north I still

246
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:15,189
do working north a kind of switch

247
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,380
between both but it seems like the

248
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:23,930
cultivators are the ones who are first

249
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:27,019
being I don't want to say driven out but

250
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:29,209
being having the most difficulty

251
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:31,539
surviving having the most difficulty

252
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:34,250
adapting having the most difficulty

253
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,570
finding a place for themselves as things

254
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,049
move forward and it seems like the ones

255
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,240
who are almost newest to cannabis the

256
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,109
ones who are starting new businesses

257
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,980
sometimes almost have an advantage

258
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,509
because they're not trying to bring an

259
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,200
old business in they're just starting

260
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:50,840
something from scratch

261
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,040
does that does it make sense it doesn't

262
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,250
I think the California again

263
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:56,899
is unique because as we went through

264
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,208
this transition of illicit or gray

265
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:00,769
market to legal you had thousands upon

266
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,448
thousands of growers that existed

267
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:03,948
already in the state that the state was

268
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:05,508
encouraging you know hey get legal will

269
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:07,879
give you the opportunity to come into

270
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:09,440
the light you didn't have that with you

271
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,730
know to an extent with retailers but

272
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
certainly not with processors it's a

273
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,389
relatively new industry distributors is

274
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,560
you know very new industry but with the

275
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:17,089
cultivators there were so many of them

276
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,588
so while you have you know all the

277
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,850
northern counties you know Mendocino

278
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:21,470
Humboldt Trinity and then the whole

279
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,209
Grass Valley region all those guys were

280
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,589
we're dealing with you know okay do we

281
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,909
want to make the determination of stop

282
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:27,050
having an addressable market of the rest

283
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:28,399
of the United States on the illicit

284
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:30,169
market to having an addressable market

285
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,610
of just California yeah they had to make

286
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,559
that decision of do we want to do we

287
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,329
want to come in and they're all largely

288
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:36,588
cottage industry growers they weren't

289
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:38,229
you know large-scale commercial growers

290
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,209
they are now seeing Salinas Monterey

291
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,329
Carpinteria you know in the desert so is

292
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:45,619
much much different so ya mean to to

293
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:47,750
your point are those guys having a tough

294
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,220
time surviving yeah they're a really

295
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,089
tough time because now they dealing with

296
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,528
each other and a much smaller

297
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,269
addressable market of just the state of

298
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:54,948
California they're also dealing with all

299
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:55,970
these mega corporations that are coming

300
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:59,240
in and building these massive news

301
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:03,769
facilities yeah I think I see sometimes

302
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,629
they're almost there's a cultural

303
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,789
challenge sometimes I see too there are

304
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:11,240
folks who and it's not just cultivators

305
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:17,539
but folks who have been kind of steeped

306
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:19,970
in a kind of ploy stirred or or remote

307
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:23,480
whatever the word is of industry for a

308
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:26,209
while and now we do have private money

309
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,430
now we do have mature investors now we

310
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:30,018
do have sophisticated people who want to

311
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:32,149
do real estate transactions that are

312
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:34,399
kind of just novel to a lot of these

313
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:37,009
folks there's a deal I'm working on now

314
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,708
and the buyer and the seller very much

315
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:41,929
want to do the deal but they're just

316
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:44,838
almost like socially incompatible right

317
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:46,338
the buyer wants to communicate through

318
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,160
the attorneys that the seller thinks

319
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:52,639
that's impersonal and waste too much

320
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:55,578
money on legal fees the seller wants to

321
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,379
call the CEO of the buyer often and

322
00:10:55,578 --> 00:11:00,379
schedule big conference calls which is

323
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:03,230
totally fine way to do it except the

324
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:05,080
buyer thinks that's nice and the whole

325
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,399
thing it seems like it might

326
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,400
collapse because they're just too

327
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,120
incompatible yeah yeah the business is

328
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:14,799
compatible but the styles of these two

329
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,659
guys is not compatible at this point

330
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,879
yeah I see a ton of that and a lot of

331
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:21,129
its based on sophistication of the of

332
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,929
the level of business they've done and

333
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:24,639
oftentimes the buyers at this point are

334
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,199
sophisticated guys they're coming in

335
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,669
with real capital they're looking at

336
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,890
these businesses in a very traditional

337
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:31,299
way they're they're looking at you know

338
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,799
what their revenues are currently what

339
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:34,659
their what their ebody is what their

340
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,829
what their growth curve is they're

341
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:37,209
thinking about this from the standpoint

342
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,800
of when I make an investment you know

343
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,690
what do I think this looks like five

344
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,309
years downstream is there a cash on cash

345
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,750
component to it you know what's my

346
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:45,939
horizon what's you know what's the debt

347
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,340
service can these guys actually cashflow

348
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,690
hard enough to service the debt yeah

349
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,250
the sellers are looking at from the

350
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,050
standpoint if I used to grow weed and

351
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,490
buy it for you know make it for a dollar

352
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,479
and sell it for two and a handshake was

353
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,950
my bond yeah

354
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,269
it's so for them you know going through

355
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,590
all these you know questions like when I

356
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:01,360
tell people to put a date a room

357
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,950
together I often get this blank stare if

358
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,210
you know what's the day to room and when

359
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,620
you go through and you know put the due

360
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,300
diligence checklist in front of they go

361
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,679
we don't do any of this stuff you know

362
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,789
yeah you don't think you do but the

363
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:11,649
person that's actually gonna be writing

364
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:13,059
that checks or sure does and you know

365
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:15,009
put it together now because ultimately

366
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:17,169
you're gonna have to anyway and rather

367
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:18,819
do it with me first and then do it with

368
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,929
the buyer that goes you know I'm not

369
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,760
interesting so these guys have no idea

370
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:24,819
what they're doing yeah I feel like it's

371
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,529
one of the the things they just kind of

372
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,710
have to like hold their nose and like

373
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:32,620
jump is the process of selling your

374
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:35,370
company is slow and difficult and

375
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,840
unpleasant and expensive and there's no

376
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,690
there's no escape from any of those four

377
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,810
things um you can do it with friendly

378
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:47,980
people you can plan ahead but it's just

379
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:50,049
gonna be difficult and slow because

380
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,300
that's what someone who's gonna write a

381
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:54,459
check for millions of dollars is gonna

382
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:56,949
insist we go through in order to get the

383
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,300
check and it's hard to like you said

384
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,340
there's a lot of folks who are used to I

385
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,839
grew it for one I sold it for two and

386
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,540
then I went to Costa Rica for six months

387
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,210
right which is awesome it's just not

388
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:08,529
really the next step and the problem is

389
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,790
and now you're starting to get the Nona

390
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,319
sophisticate investors our command but

391
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,519
they've already come in and those guys

392
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,620
are already thinking about the next link

393
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,449
in the in the evolution of the company

394
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,799
which is they want their exit you know

395
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,089
these guys aren't buying for

396
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,019
you know altruistic reasons they're

397
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,269
buying because they want to make money

398
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,500
yeah so if they come in you know two

399
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,480
years ago or three years ago when these

400
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,250
first real deals really started you know

401
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,379
happening in California and you start

402
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,028
seeing people poor you know not not sort

403
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:32,919
of money that was buried in ceramic

404
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:34,328
vessels in your backyard on the hill but

405
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,679
actually you know coming in from you

406
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:36,939
know reputable sources around Los

407
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,469
Angeles or San Francisco

408
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,910
those guys are already thinking of

409
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,709
cabinet in this deal for three years and

410
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:44,169
now I want to sell to the GTI's or the

411
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:46,028
the canopy's or the aurora's or you know

412
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:47,919
you name the the multi-state operator in

413
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:49,149
the US or the LP up in Canada and

414
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,669
they're thinking about what their exits

415
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:53,889
going to be and so they're doing things

416
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:55,629
properly already on the sale side so

417
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:57,189
when you've got the guys that are still

418
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:58,740
resisting it that are saying you don't

419
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,839
know if I want to go through all this

420
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,278
they're not only at a deficit you know

421
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,420
to to what their knowledge base should

422
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:05,828
be with a buyer but they're at an

423
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:07,028
amazing deficit to the people that have

424
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:09,789
already gone through the process once

425
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:11,679
and are now you know that further long

426
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:15,429
in their in their lifecycle yeah I feel

427
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:17,139
there's kind of the so we know nobody

428
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:20,049
likes other regulations we know nobody

429
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:22,870
likes kind of the cost of vendors and

430
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:24,849
the cost of people like me but on the

431
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,500
other hand everybody was great will come

432
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,409
out of the darkness will kind of have

433
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,708
like a real w2 it'll and it's almost

434
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:35,559
like the two things have to go together

435
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:40,778
people wanted legalization without all

436
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:43,299
the legalities yeah maybe that was maybe

437
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:44,708
that's a really obvious comment it is

438
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,599
well it's one that shouldn't be lost and

439
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,708
I see like comments and MJ business all

440
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,269
the time or in you know when you see

441
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:51,309
like LA Times articles or Samsung or

442
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:52,509
Chronicle articles you see the comment

443
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:54,759
section that comes after the article

444
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:56,439
inevitably it's like you know look at

445
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,200
what the announcement of Gavin Newsom

446
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,699
now sending you know federal enforcement

447
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,170
up to the northern counties to try to

448
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:03,729
enforce illegal cultivations and

449
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,750
everyone's like you know this guy that

450
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,820
can't believe he's doing this I thought

451
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:09,070
he's Pro cannabis yeah he's Pro legal

452
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,440
cannabis he's not probe elicit anything

453
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,270
you know so he you guys were given a

454
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,649
couple of years period I'm first of all

455
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,149
I'm the biggest supporter of you know

456
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,889
illicit farmers you know over the last

457
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,360
thirty years you're gonna find but a

458
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,740
certain point you know when you realize

459
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,519
that this is disrupting a market that

460
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,629
they're trying to get off the ground

461
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,220
they're doing it in a way that everyone

462
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:25,958
asks for them to do it yeah there's got

463
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,060
to be some some give-and-take there so

464
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,839
it's you know I would I prefer not to

465
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:31,579
see sort of the years of camp come

466
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,930
in humboldt Mendocino sure I don't want

467
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,520
to see helicopters landing on people's

468
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:36,229
properties but at the same time I also

469
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:38,929
don't want to see illicit growers taking

470
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,250
em you know the ability to do have a

471
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:41,809
good business away from guys that are

472
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,720
following every bit of letter of the law

473
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:48,709
so it's it's a tough it's a tough

474
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,620
situation there but eventually you are

475
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:54,220
gonna see the the people that were

476
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:56,089
non-sophisticated unwilling to to change

477
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,950
they're just gonna end up going out of

478
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:01,000
business yeah and I think sometimes I

479
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,000
use the word almost unsophisticated

480
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:05,059
incorrectly I do sometimes because I

481
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:08,450
think sometimes they're they're super

482
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:13,250
sophisticated they just want to stay out

483
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:17,930
of the legal market I mean it's not easy

484
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:22,700
it's not easy being a criminal and they

485
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:23,379
prefer yeah sure but the point

486
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,879
well-taken

487
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:28,039
living outside the law requires honesty

488
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:29,450
it requires being good at what you do it

489
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:30,500
requires not burning people and all the

490
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,028
things that you expect to see in real

491
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,769
business actually it happens in a much

492
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:35,990
more profound way on the on the illicit

493
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:37,220
side or the the outlaw side of it and I

494
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,360
think that the people that all of us in

495
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,279
this room probably dealt with for years

496
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,570
and years it was because you know we're

497
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,919
still sitting here because you didn't

498
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,780
burn anyone or do anything really stupid

499
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,399
and I think that you know acting that

500
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:47,870
way for years is probably the mantra

501
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,730
that you should have as a as a business

502
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,830
owner in general and you realize the

503
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,029
real criminals and the real dirtbags out

504
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,290
there are the guys on the legal side

505
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,730
that are coming in trying to figure out

506
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:57,169
ways to create term sheets that

507
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,149
completely and totally rape you

508
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:01,009
so it requires guys like Jay and I to

509
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:03,799
sit there and go dad don't sign that

510
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:05,240
like they absolutely not so the believe

511
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,279
me want to say I'm absolutely

512
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,509
sympathetic to the outlaw it's just a

513
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,279
question of how do you bring the outlaw

514
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:11,568
and into the legal market without you

515
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,129
know getting absolutely destroyed in the

516
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:14,629
process and right now I think that's a

517
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,910
business-wise it's a really tough thing

518
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,980
to advise people on doing because they

519
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,890
only know a certain way and that certain

520
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:28,059
way was based 100% on honesty and trust

521
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:30,350
yeah and the returns in you know non

522
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:35,419
reported transactions can be really good

523
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:37,699
you know we have this client who said

524
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,220
something once like I just want to go

525
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,140
back to the time when I could grow four

526
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,460
three months a year and surf in Costa

527
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,050
Rica for nine

528
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:48,289
and we thought like that would be

529
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:49,430
awesome but that's not yes please

530
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:53,930
yeah like that that was never a

531
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:56,029
sustainable that wasn't gonna work but

532
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,799
but it did for thirty-plus you yeah yeah

533
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:58,910
right dad so you know when you have

534
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:07,190
something that's been working that long

535
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:12,290
and that's pretty good yeah do that if I

536
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:13,430
could yeah yeah I mean look it's the

537
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:16,069
fact that matters that we are going

538
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,630
through a crazy transition right now in

539
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:19,069
the state of California and when I you

540
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,780
know the analogy I always used is kind

541
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:22,399
of in a relay race for you're passing

542
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:24,049
the baton and right now we're in the

543
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,940
space that's you know 50 yards of the

544
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:28,909
baton pass and you know you're on the

545
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,440
the the gray market or prop 215 side on

546
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,990
the you know perform early and now

547
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,160
you're moving into the post 64 you know

548
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:38,690
new life in California cannabis and

549
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,220
surviving this baton pass Lane it's

550
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,230
gonna be exceptionally difficult now

551
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,150
having said that the illicit market in

552
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,440
the near term until all 50 states are

553
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,300
legalizing the United States and you're

554
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,160
able to cross state lines we're never

555
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:50,389
gonna see the the illicit market go away

556
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,350
and I think there's a lot of people in

557
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,910
the northern counties and a lot of

558
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:54,769
people even probably than ten blocks of

559
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,940
here that are perfectly pleased to stay

560
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,619
in the market they've always been in

561
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,019
into your point as far as profit

562
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:01,759
motivation the the return profile is

563
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,650
still significantly better to operate on

564
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,230
that side there's just a much higher

565
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,519
risk profile as well so you know where

566
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,289
do you want to where do you want to live

567
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,609
you know I think for most people now

568
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,500
they're weighing that option they're

569
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,819
having to think about seriously but at

570
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,230
the same time as they're making that

571
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,669
decision from a business standpoint

572
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,980
which is really I think we're here

573
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,360
discussing it yeah how do you how do you

574
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,730
think about it no way that's gonna be

575
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,929
meaningful so that eventually you're not

576
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,400
spending three months on the beach in

577
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,960
Costa Rica you're spending all your time

578
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,550
on the beach in Costa Rica because you

579
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,110
had a meaningful sale you don't allowed

580
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:31,369
you to walk away from a great business

581
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:33,559
that you built up and said I made the

582
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:34,839
transition from you know from I wouldn't

583
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:37,399
say dark to light but great alight

584
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:39,079
successfully yeah I think that's a

585
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,040
conversation we have a lot with clients

586
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:44,779
who it never they never really thought

587
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,109
what they were what was gonna happen to

588
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:50,119
the business in the end and most small

589
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:53,240
businesses are either sold or closed

590
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:55,579
right and I hear clients often say like

591
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,490
when we do our IPO and I want to like

592
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:59,730
gently lien

593
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:03,150
and be like almost no business does an

594
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,950
IPO even if you're fantastic spectacular

595
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,450
probably not gonna happen

596
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:10,679
especially for a cannabis business right

597
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,940
um they're coming for you J so getting

598
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,220
you know kind of starting those

599
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,600
conversations were in reality you were

600
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,279
probably always going to sell this

601
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,678
business you were gonna sell it to

602
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,660
someone you know you were gonna pass it

603
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,269
on to someone or you were gonna sell it

604
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:29,700
to a stranger I'm hoping that you would

605
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:30,900
get some great outcome right for this

606
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,299
business it's been your life and your

607
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,710
sweat and your blood and your tears and

608
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:37,200
you told me a few minutes ago that you

609
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,840
have a sign that your mother wrote

610
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,660
outside your farm that was discouraging

611
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,789
people's horses from pooping on your

612
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,340
farm and she's had this sign for like

613
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:48,750
six years this is your life like this

614
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:51,529
business is your life it's called dew

615
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:56,759
point there's the horses nearby are very

616
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:58,920
kind right she's not yeah so I think we

617
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:01,640
talk a lot and that was a long aside I'm

618
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:05,070
sorry we talk a lot with clients about

619
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,429
kind of getting them comfortable with

620
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:10,259
the idea of it might be a great idea for

621
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:11,910
you to transition away from this this

622
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:14,190
might be the best chance you have to

623
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,269
right move on to its next yeah I think

624
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,860
that's something that shouldn't be lost

625
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:18,808
on most people anyone that started a

626
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,250
small business when you go into it you

627
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:21,420
know you think about how great the

628
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,549
business can't do and how you can build

629
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,740
this thing but after about your five or

630
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:27,569
six or seven you start to realize that

631
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,609
this thing is is you it's a marriage

632
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:31,139
it's a complete tether on everything

633
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:32,639
else you do it limits your ability if

634
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,690
you find a better opportunity you're

635
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,200
like what do I do with the one I already

636
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,640
have

637
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,920
you know I'm stuck with the Saints in

638
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,900
many ways of business as an anchor and

639
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,670
then you're stuck with it so when you

640
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,440
think about an exit you know it's it's

641
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,269
rare that a business is cash flowing so

642
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,470
well that you know you're like look I'm

643
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:48,299
perfectly happy just to keep this thing

644
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,069
going and for a long time that's what

645
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,869
Northern California cannabis was you

646
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:53,250
know it's like as much as we can make

647
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:54,509
we're know as much as we can grow on the

648
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,759
risk that we're willing to take doing it

649
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:58,289
you know it's I don't know anyone to

650
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:00,210
date that's ever so lar ever thrown away

651
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:04,440
a pound of weed you know it's it's it's

652
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:06,960
going to find a home unless it's unless

653
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,009
it's completely molded out or some other

654
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,090
thing even then I'm there's shady guys

655
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:14,160
when you see clients who are really

656
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:20,939
attached to some business if they've

657
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:22,590
been going forever how do you as it's

658
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,330
often the case some people in the

659
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:26,730
business want to sell yeah some people

660
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:27,569
in business don't want to sell right how

661
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,160
do you how do you have those

662
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:33,869
conversations with them where I mean

663
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:38,070
because my instinct is to encourage them

664
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:40,439
to probably take the good offer

665
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:42,359
take the reasonable offer because it's

666
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,220
here I I did it with a client yesterday

667
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,629
okay and then in the client yesterday

668
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,160
you know there are three different term

669
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,600
sheets around the table for them yeah by

670
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,900
three decent companies you know all of

671
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:53,519
them were qualified suitors yeah

672
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,230
they got an offer you know yesterday

673
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,839
that was the the third turn of a term

674
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,339
sheet and you know we got the call like

675
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,509
what do you think and our answer is you

676
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:01,949
know look you guys have been waiting for

677
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:03,450
this for a while this this is one that

678
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,769
no I can you live with but it's one

679
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,779
that's got great upside potential it's

680
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,440
got mitigated downside risk yeah what

681
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,089
else you waiting for

682
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,340
you know if you are serious about

683
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:12,750
selling this company take the offer this

684
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:14,879
is it especially that's gonna integrate

685
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,039
you into a company where you think that

686
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,780
corporate culture is one that largely

687
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,039
coincides with who you are as people and

688
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:21,690
you think you can integrate it and

689
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,369
easily the thing I discourage feel from

690
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,750
doing is being acquired by a company

691
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:26,309
where the culture corporate culture is

692
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,259
just not a fit and you're you know

693
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:30,000
moving into a group you want nothing to

694
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:31,230
do with ultimately and they go oh well

695
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,279
it's only a two-year lockup or I've

696
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,539
gotta stay with the company well that

697
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,539
could be the most miserable two years of

698
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:38,159
your life you know so it's we try to

699
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:40,500
encourage the a if there's one buy or

700
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,550
one seller that is on the team that

701
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,200
really wants to sell there's another one

702
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:44,849
that doesn't have that conversation

703
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,730
internally first make sure that whenever

704
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:49,199
you go out with a forward facing look to

705
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:51,029
the outside world you're doing it with

706
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,920
consistency yeah if there is one person

707
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:54,750
that doesn't you know want to it then

708
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,610
you figure out a way to offer to sell to

709
00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:01,049
them first or you know a way to do

710
00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:02,250
something else that allows the the needs

711
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:04,980
of the different people within the

712
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:09,750
within the company to match yeah I think

713
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:12,990
that if they're tyent's can go into

714
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:15,869
these conversations thinking someday I

715
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,730
will do something next right this isn't

716
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:20,549
the last thing I'm ever gonna do this is

717
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:22,849
the thing I'm doing right now it can

718
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:25,309
kind of facilitate either

719
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:29,480
other people coming in you tell your

720
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:31,159
partners or just not the this is my

721
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,660
member like Gollum in Lord of the Rings

722
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:39,710
like this is mine like I feel like it it

723
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:43,400
will wither if it's kind of concrete

724
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:45,049
like that I also think that a liquidity

725
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,280
event even one that might not be the one

726
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:47,599
that you're hoping for but you know if

727
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,619
you had a company that's doing you know

728
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,059
call it three million dollars in

729
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:51,679
top-line revenue and someone offers you

730
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:52,759
five times revenue and also there's a

731
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,160
fifteen million dollar offer on the

732
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:57,140
table and you've only got you know 1/2

733
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,279
million dollars of debt to knock out and

734
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,960
you've got a couple other equity

735
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,549
investors that own 20% of your business

736
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,049
if you end up walking away from this

737
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:05,690
think post-tax with six or seven million

738
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:06,559
dollars in your pocket I hate to break

739
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,059
it to most people that's life-changing

740
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,500
money yeah and if you want to go out

741
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,759
there now and make investments yourself

742
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,259
into other spaces and start peppering

743
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,589
the market with companies that you like

744
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:17,210
with check sizes of 150 to 250 K you

745
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:19,099
know also now you can you know spread

746
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,210
that couple million bucks still keep two

747
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:21,559
or three million in your pocket and

748
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,329
you've put three or four million back to

749
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:25,129
work in the space yeah hoping you get

750
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:26,839
another exit on one of 15 companies

751
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,410
you're putting in and chances are based

752
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,349
on the climate

753
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,460
you'll get one yeah so it's you know for

754
00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:33,409
people that are like oh I'm holding out

755
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,120
for the 50 million dollar payday yeah

756
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,769
sure if you've got a business that's

757
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,809
that's that dynamic and in that

758
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:40,819
exceptional great but if you're you know

759
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:43,129
creating a product that you know another

760
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:44,720
vape cart you know okay you probably

761
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,490
want to take the 15 million bucks yeah

762
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,250
one thing we were talking about earlier

763
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:52,609
was the idea that so when you're being

764
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:55,730
paid with stock it's you're really

765
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:58,039
making a second bet right like the first

766
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,210
bet was that I can build a company I can

767
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,839
do this I can put this money in its

768
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,059
going to succeed

769
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,589
the second bet is they can build a

770
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:06,649
company they can do it better right they

771
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:12,199
can do it with my with everything I've

772
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:14,509
done and it's this hum yeah it's I feel

773
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,259
like that's one scenario where I'm

774
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:20,660
always encouraging folks to be really on

775
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:22,730
the one hand I'm I try and encourage

776
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,009
them to find a transaction that works

777
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,920
but I think I'm also really cool on

778
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:32,660
accepting paper from Canadian companies

779
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,450
which is just so such a gamble at this

780
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,259
point

781
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,730
I'll look in the camera okay don't do it

782
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:40,500
it's I'm not saying don't do it a

783
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,910
hundred percent but a lot of these

784
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,589
companies like they they have almost no

785
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,350
liquidity and they trade you know ten

786
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:47,819
thousand shares a day so and you're

787
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:49,469
about to be given millions of shares of

788
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:50,639
paper so it's like okay if you've had

789
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,829
that paper anything off restriction

790
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,140
there's no if there's no buyer on the

791
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:56,308
other side of the trade then what do you

792
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,540
really have you know if you actually

793
00:26:56,308 --> 00:26:58,619
start putting these shares out in the

794
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,509
market you're gonna crater the share

795
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,798
price of the company anyway so if you're

796
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:03,420
gonna do it make sure it's a company

797
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,929
that really has you know the ability to

798
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,190
to let you have your ultimate exit if

799
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,570
not you're probably better off you know

800
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,980
continue to build your company if you're

801
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:12,230
good at building the company then keep

802
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,640
going and someone else will come along

803
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,890
later yeah so the question I have for

804
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,630
you that came on the same idea is yeah

805
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,000
as as we're watching progression happen

806
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,049
on a federal basis in definitely

807
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,329
watching progression happens

808
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:25,470
state-by-state and I don't think there's

809
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:26,730
a person in this room that doesn't think

810
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,048
the federal legality is not going to

811
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,400
happen you know not probably not in this

812
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:31,440
administration but certainly you know in

813
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,509
the next if it if it goes you know the

814
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,500
way of a Democratic Senate and a

815
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:38,669
Democratic president at that point you

816
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,619
know what do you think about the

817
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:42,000
California market as an export market in

818
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,379
the long term because for me I'm

819
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
watching a lot of consolidation right

820
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,140
now happened in California but

821
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,790
ultimately California always powered

822
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,870
American cannabis do you think that day

823
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:50,129
comes back and do you think it's

824
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,689
worthwhile telling people to hold out

825
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,760
until a the capital markets open up in

826
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:57,090
the US and B when California becomes the

827
00:27:53,759 --> 00:28:00,839
epicenter again of American cannabis so

828
00:27:57,089 --> 00:28:03,089
I mean I think I've heard people like

829
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,659
Lori Ajax say and one of these days

830
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:08,789
we're going to become an exporter and

831
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,380
it's probably true eventually I'm

832
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:13,409
reluctant for any of my clients to hold

833
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,700
out for that just because there's

834
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,230
probably going to be ten things that

835
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,769
happen between now and then that might

836
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:22,769
impact how things actually look you know

837
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:24,269
someday we'll probably have I used to

838
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:26,308
smoke a pack of cigarettes every day I

839
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:29,099
think the tobacco was grown in North

840
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:31,168
Carolina at that point I have no idea

841
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:32,639
where it's grown today but it's probably

842
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:35,850
not cheapest to do at North Carolina

843
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,470
anymore um cannabis commercial

844
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:40,969
recreational cannabis probably become

845
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:45,089
just like any other commodity Sunday and

846
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,950
for maybe I have a lot of times up north

847
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:49,939
who

848
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:51,288
to become like high-end vineyards right

849
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,630
they're gonna have a very specialized

850
00:28:51,288 --> 00:28:56,028
product the appellation theory of the

851
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,769
humble crow normandeau grown and I'm

852
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:59,089
sure for some of them that'll work

853
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:01,940
I think the question is like for how

854
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:04,939
many of them could it work so I guess I

855
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:07,490
think federal legalization will probably

856
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,830
happen but not soon enough to impact

857
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,829
anyone today what do you do you think

858
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:14,990
it's would you if someone came in to you

859
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:17,058
and said I'm gonna wait until I can sell

860
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,950
my product in 50 states so that I really

861
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:21,888
have a market could you tell they're

862
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:23,028
crazy it depends on the toes of the

863
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:24,019
client yeah I'm looking at some of the

864
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:26,419
companies are being built in California

865
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:27,950
right now and you know you look at the

866
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:29,778
announcement made yesterday that Gotham

867
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,580
green put 125 million to work into flow

868
00:29:29,778 --> 00:29:33,500
Cana and you know and do I think that

869
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:34,939
you know we 125 million dollars in the

870
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,500
revenue that Mikey Steinmetz is putting

871
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,659
out of the the Fetzer facility up north

872
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,329
that he's got the ability to to weather

873
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:42,860
a storm for a period of time yeah 125 is

874
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:44,269
a decent investment by any other

875
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:46,038
industry standards it's a tiny

876
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:48,829
investment but it's you know for canvas

877
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:53,269
is big a company like that or a company

878
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:54,980
and you know like I don't know some of

879
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:57,620
the other mega you know as groups are

880
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,778
being put together that that are looking

881
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:01,548
at California is a consolidation play

882
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:02,990
yeah you know do I think that for them

883
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:04,460
you know companies that are raising

884
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:06,138
capital at north of three or four

885
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,769
hundred million dollars in as a

886
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:09,288
valuation

887
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:10,278
I would I would think those guys would

888
00:30:09,288 --> 00:30:11,629
probably want to weather the storm

889
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:13,069
because I think that in several years

890
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:15,409
time you know I don't think that this is

891
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:16,460
a something that goes on forever and

892
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:18,080
while I agree with you that in the

893
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,909
meantime you know do we see like the the

894
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,500
the country of Colombia become an export

895
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:23,570
market or do we see like Macedonia

896
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,679
become an export market to Europe or you

897
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:26,750
know are there new places they're gonna

898
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,759
pop open sure but I always think there I

899
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,169
think there's always gonna be the need

900
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:31,669
for high in flour and there's always

901
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:33,288
gonna be producers that are specialized

902
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:35,600
for high in flour yeah I think that the

903
00:30:33,288 --> 00:30:37,069
part that we commoditized is is you know

904
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,648
the extraction side of it where people

905
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:41,388
are gonna grow just a blast yeah so I've

906
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:44,058
got a fine

907
00:30:41,388 --> 00:30:45,648
technology that it thinks and I think

908
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:48,579
it's compelling but they have a

909
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:52,278
basically like a new gummy processing

910
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:53,778
technology that is fantastic and it's

911
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:57,349
their goal to basically make that

912
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:59,148
platform you mean you could you could do

913
00:30:57,349 --> 00:31:00,978
the up title in 50 states and then

914
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:03,079
at the last minute put in cannabis from

915
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:05,629
that state right there's no reason the

916
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:09,319
first nine tenths of the gummy needs to

917
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:10,848
contain cannabis they are a company and

918
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:12,618
I think some of them if there are

919
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,388
manufacturing techniques if there are

920
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:16,788
some new recipes that could come around

921
00:31:14,388 --> 00:31:19,338
and really I mean I think sorry

922
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:22,128
roundabout way of saying I think some

923
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:26,838
products could become national even

924
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:28,128
before we have I think they are I mean I

925
00:31:26,838 --> 00:31:29,898
think you're looking at some of the the

926
00:31:28,128 --> 00:31:31,248
branded products out there and the race

927
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:33,558
right now is to create you know brand

928
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:34,879
equity in branded products but a lot of

929
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,138
those are licensing deals for that you

930
00:31:34,878 --> 00:31:37,398
know they'll be created in California

931
00:31:36,138 --> 00:31:38,689
they're licensed to five or six other

932
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:39,798
states on the expectation that when

933
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,210
legalization happens they've already

934
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:44,538
built the brand equity and then they can

935
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:46,519
you know move in with 3pl facilities and

936
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:49,579
in five different locations think about

937
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:50,719
licensing so in the past four or five

938
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:53,538
months there's been a ton of excitement

939
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:55,629
in California about how much contract

940
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:59,509
manufacturing people can do right and

941
00:31:55,628 --> 00:32:02,358
today's the final regulations people can

942
00:31:59,509 --> 00:32:07,639
do a good amount those rules 904 is that

943
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:15,228
right I think it's 50 30 to the the

944
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:17,718
white labeling yeah yeah people so

945
00:32:15,229 --> 00:32:19,609
there's some hopes to jump in when

946
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:21,109
people can do it but I wonder when you

947
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:24,408
see folks come to you who want to

948
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:27,878
assemble you know portfolio brands yeah

949
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:30,259
right a portfolio of iconic brands and

950
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:32,538
then just license the heck out of them

951
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:34,969
is that something that you think is

952
00:32:32,538 --> 00:32:37,308
there is there a future that business or

953
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:41,210
is that kind of trying to do it like

954
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:42,888
under almost yeah I think there's a I

955
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,019
think there's definitely a future of it

956
00:32:42,888 --> 00:32:46,398
for it if you're talking about a

957
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:47,479
california-based company if you're

958
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,158
talking about a Connecticut based

959
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:50,389
company I don't think you were large

960
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:52,549
enough addressable market in your home

961
00:32:50,388 --> 00:32:53,959
market to to really want to be able to

962
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:55,548
do it that way but if you're talking

963
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,690
about you know when I think about the

964
00:32:55,548 --> 00:32:58,038
market we're sitting right now it's the

965
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,210
largest canvas market in the world I

966
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:01,128
mean if you think that there's 39

967
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,749
million people in California and 20 21

968
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:04,368
million of those people live from LA

969
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:06,259
County down to the Mexican border across

970
00:33:04,368 --> 00:33:07,488
five counties in the space that you know

971
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:09,469
geographically is about the size of

972
00:33:07,489 --> 00:33:10,879
Rhode Island you know you're talking

973
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:12,230
about a market that is just

974
00:33:10,878 --> 00:33:13,579
significantly more

975
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,759
than any other market that's out there

976
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:18,439
that's that's Colorado Washington Oregon

977
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,509
Alaska and Arizona combined you know in

978
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,279
in one market so if you think about from

979
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:24,259
the standpoint of aggregating brands and

980
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:25,759
only working just the SoCal market and

981
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:28,099
using that as your as your jumping off

982
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,900
point then yeah I mean I think just that

983
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:31,308
alone is worth it and then you can think

984
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,690
about licensing but if you're talking a

985
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:34,369
small adjustable market that's where

986
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,320
you're launching like a Minnesota based

987
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:38,178
you know like aggregation of brands

988
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,779
company it doesn't make any sense to me

989
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:43,910
I think another maybe one thing I should

990
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:47,678
have said was so if I were a company and

991
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:51,529
I wanted to get the rights to make

992
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,360
Marley and meatloaf and Guns N'Roses and

993
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:57,139
I said I was going to be the license and

994
00:33:53,359 --> 00:34:03,949
company to have the music all of the

995
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:05,780
music the type today we're still today

996
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,370
there's a ton of products say there's a

997
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:10,519
ton of inconsistency at dispensaries

998
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:13,509
right today there's still kind of the on

999
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:16,969
the retail side the markets still really

1000
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:19,940
do you think the brands that are gonna

1001
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:21,529
be are the ones that have you know the

1002
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,599
Grateful Dead label on them and that's

1003
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,639
what's gonna allow them to kind of

1004
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,339
become something or it's just gonna be

1005
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:30,260
like a better product no III don't and

1006
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,608
the the private equity firm that I

1007
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,800
founded Akal years ago we did the Willie

1008
00:34:31,608 --> 00:34:36,590
Nelson transaction okay we led the

1009
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,690
series and Willie yes you really thought

1010
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,829
about yeah we actually were working very

1011
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,450
closely with the Grateful Dead and the

1012
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:42,500
Garcia band estate as well at the time

1013
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:43,969
you know we were looking really

1014
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,469
seriously at do we bring it Grateful

1015
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:47,059
Dead canvas Brandon market and was right

1016
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:48,769
when Marley was being done by privateer

1017
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:50,570
and is right around the same time that

1018
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:54,019
you're watching you know snoop work with

1019
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:55,309
Casa Verde so you know everyone was

1020
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:57,349
thinking about the standpoint of you

1021
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:59,659
know do you need a marquee sort of an

1022
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:00,858
endorser to do it and the thing I kept

1023
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:03,139
hearing that was consistent across

1024
00:35:00,858 --> 00:35:04,730
everyone is well the advertising

1025
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:05,900
equivalency of having these people out

1026
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,039
there having the name out there because

1027
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,750
you know if there's restrictions in

1028
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,159
advertising and marketing can you make

1029
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,539
up for those restrictions by actually

1030
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,829
having you know Willie Nelson every

1031
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:14,840
single tour stop wearing a welder's

1032
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:16,309
reserve hat or having you know Snoop

1033
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,930
Dogg talking about the fact he's got

1034
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:19,460
some deals live well in Colorado and

1035
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:22,339
that that was gonna you know drive

1036
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,019
business but but ultimately you know you

1037
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,130
look at the wine industry and you know

1038
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,750
while you might have a couple of wine

1039
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,340
it's not coolest name that drives the

1040
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,969
other sales it's the underlying product

1041
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,559
itself

1042
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:32,419
okay and I think with cannabis you know

1043
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,210
it's I think right now what's becoming

1044
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:37,130
hotter are specific genetics are still

1045
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,139
hot and then specific growers that are

1046
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,670
putting those genetics out so if you

1047
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:42,079
know you really trust you know whatever

1048
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,130
whatever the underlying brand is like

1049
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,500
I'm here today with a group called

1050
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,940
Palomar and in Palomar puts out some of

1051
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,900
the best you know craft cannabis product

1052
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,340
in the country and I don't think people

1053
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,510
are gonna buy it because he they had a

1054
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,850
celebrity endorsement they're gonna buy

1055
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,590
it because you know the grower for

1056
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:57,489
Palomar is one of the best guys and then

1057
00:35:54,590 --> 00:36:01,250
in the state of California okay so then

1058
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:05,169
what made Willie Nelson's likeness

1059
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:07,369
compelling to you I voted against it

1060
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:11,090
only person on the investment committee

1061
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:12,619
that said no okay okay what was

1062
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:14,450
compelling to me was was the fact that

1063
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:15,740
there's an icon that's recognizable even

1064
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:17,419
in states that are illegal especially

1065
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:19,759
the American South you know Texas

1066
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,650
Louisiana Tennessee like all the you

1067
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,910
know country music states that anyone

1068
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,710
that smoked cannabis down there be like

1069
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:26,329
oh man I got rye well his wheat because

1070
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,099
there's there's certain part of it that

1071
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:29,630
everyone's gonna try it once because

1072
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,858
it's Willie's weed but will they try it

1073
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,599
the second time or the third time I

1074
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,409
think that brand quality has to hold the

1075
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,210
day and as you said there's

1076
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:36,349
inconsistency and if you hire six

1077
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,358
different growers in six different

1078
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:39,529
markets to grow that same brand even if

1079
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:41,480
you're putting out the same genetically

1080
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,950
if everyone's doing like an OG Kush yeah

1081
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,300
unless you're growing in the exact same

1082
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:45,739
growing conditions with the exact same

1083
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,119
media with the exact same nutrients the

1084
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:48,858
exact same relative humidity and soon

1085
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,809
it's going to be a different product and

1086
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:52,069
I don't like true branding perspective I

1087
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,000
don't think there's any brand equity and

1088
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,760
something that you can't say is

1089
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,818
consistent yeah

1090
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,819
[Music]

1091
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:07,409
you point are you guys like trying to

1092
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:14,338
raise money

1093
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:16,259
friends and family investors those that

1094
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:18,630
couldn't hear it in the audience what

1095
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,060
she is saying is that her farm in her

1096
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,740
land up north is her life

1097
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:23,969
so just because she has something that

1098
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,679
people might want to purchase doesn't

1099
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:26,608
mean that she wants to sell and I think

1100
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,769
there's a lot of people that feel it

1101
00:37:26,608 --> 00:37:29,848
well I applaud that so that's that's

1102
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:31,889
great and that means that you know

1103
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:33,359
you're happy building this thing because

1104
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:38,000
it's it's what you want to do long-term

1105
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:38,000
which is awesome so Cheers

1106
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:42,059
and I don't know if the same is true

1107
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:43,739
like I know the specific guys are over

1108
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,659
here as well or a pretty decent size

1109
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:47,189
distribution company they have offices

1110
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:50,460
kind of all over the the California

1111
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:51,809
north and south I know they've done a

1112
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,949
pretty good job picking up quite a few

1113
00:37:51,809 --> 00:38:02,699
brands so I don't know if the same is

1114
00:37:52,949 --> 00:38:05,219
true for those guys but China navigating

1115
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:06,569
the regulations trying to figure out how

1116
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:07,739
to get into the market how to get into

1117
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,830
the market legally how to build

1118
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:13,739
partnerships that are scalable has been

1119
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:15,690
you know a big part of what we've been

1120
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:17,098
trying to do and then on the fundraising

1121
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,510
side there's obviously like a lot of

1122
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:20,220
interest and a lot of money but again

1123
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,680
finding those partners that can bring

1124
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:23,969
value as well as those partners that are

1125
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:26,909
strategically aligned to the type of

1126
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:29,750
growth that you want to have and kind of

1127
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:31,920
keeping this especially as I guess

1128
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:35,219
Outsiders to the industry is not those

1129
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,269
that have been in the gray market one of

1130
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:38,279
the things that's been important to us

1131
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:40,588
though has been actually working with

1132
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,080
small farmers and we have an established

1133
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:44,820
relationship with a licensed farm in

1134
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,348
medicine oh it's a big part of it but

1135
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,800
some of the pushback we've actually

1136
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:52,619
gotten from some investors as well as as

1137
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,420
well as some manufacturers that we've

1138
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:56,010
talked about partnering with has been oh

1139
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,990
like you don't need to do that like

1140
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:59,550
we've got this stuff that's grown in

1141
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:01,049
this warehouse and you should just roll

1142
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,369
forward with this it's much cheaper and

1143
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:05,010
it's much easier and like we can make

1144
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:07,349
that happen much quicker so finding

1145
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,700
those partners that are have that value

1146
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:11,700
alignment has been a little more

1147
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:13,889
difficult for us but something that

1148
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:16,389
we're working on and what's your product

1149
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:19,929
oh yes of the product drew Martin

1150
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:20,498
is a line of botanically infused

1151
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:25,828
freerolls

1152
00:39:20,498 --> 00:39:28,689
so cannabis with a specific blends of

1153
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:35,140
botanicals that have been formulated by

1154
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:40,450
by drew Martin himself herbalist that

1155
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:42,338
sounds compelling yeah I do think that's

1156
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:45,730
a good point that your name is Andrew as

1157
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:48,009
well is that right thanks Andrew I think

1158
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,028
it's a good point that as you're getting

1159
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:50,380
off the ground there's a lot of people

1160
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:52,268
that want to tell you how you should

1161
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,619
build your business and why you should

1162
00:39:52,268 --> 00:39:55,268
build your business that way and I think

1163
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:57,160
that you know if in most other

1164
00:39:55,268 --> 00:40:00,278
businesses you don't have that much

1165
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:02,018
outside influence here you know as

1166
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:03,429
people are getting in the it's amazing

1167
00:40:02,018 --> 00:40:05,348
to me that every time I go to a cannabis

1168
00:40:03,429 --> 00:40:06,608
convention seventy percent of the people

1169
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:08,019
in that room were like oh this brand new

1170
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:09,730
industry and I started laughing I go

1171
00:40:08,018 --> 00:40:11,108
that look I started this industry twenty

1172
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,838
eight years ago and I was new that

1173
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:15,130
mostly goes I was a kid and like being

1174
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:17,078
taught by guys there were twenty thirty

1175
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,009
years older than me really so it's like

1176
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:19,089
you know four people say it's a new

1177
00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:19,778
industry to know the industry has always

1178
00:40:19,088 --> 00:40:21,998
been here

1179
00:40:19,778 --> 00:40:25,298
legality is new were you were you living

1180
00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:27,759
out here now in the summertime but uh

1181
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:29,528
living living in Salt Lake City Utah and

1182
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,900
then spending most the time well I'm

1183
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:34,440
grateful that tour was sort of bouncing

1184
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:48,460
around having fun it was awesome yeah

1185
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:51,700
better than Costa Rica Jorge lot spike

1186
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:55,059
my product is called cookie crack it's a

1187
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:58,078
fantastic edible cookie and it actually

1188
00:40:55,059 --> 00:41:00,849
came from a cookie that we have been

1189
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:05,048
marketing for years without cannabis

1190
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:07,088
with crack no but now we've infused it

1191
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:08,858
with cannabis before it was just a fun

1192
00:41:07,088 --> 00:41:10,449
dessert okay cookie that actually cuz

1193
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:13,088
like both are scheduled one so I don't

1194
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:15,489
you know yeah yeah that's true and you

1195
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:17,679
know trying to get into the the legal

1196
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:21,249
part of the market if I can be so you

1197
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:23,348
know blunt it seems there's different

1198
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:25,689
ways and what I'm interested in and my

1199
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:28,229
questions about is this a shared

1200
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:29,999
facility that they just enacted

1201
00:41:28,228 --> 00:41:31,558
I think late last year and they did

1202
00:41:29,998 --> 00:41:33,298
something with it earlier this year

1203
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:36,180
which for somebody like me would be

1204
00:41:33,298 --> 00:41:39,389
perfect do you have any advice on that

1205
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:40,768
or any information so if you can find

1206
00:41:39,389 --> 00:41:42,088
someone who's looking like to open up

1207
00:41:40,768 --> 00:41:46,288
one of the shared facilities I think

1208
00:41:42,088 --> 00:41:48,409
it's pretty relatively easy to get one

1209
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:50,819
of the what does it take C s as an S

1210
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:53,458
which is yeah it's very easy to get it

1211
00:41:50,818 --> 00:41:57,808
you have to find a you know somebody

1212
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:59,639
with an N or you know m6 m7 yeah type

1213
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:02,278
license and I don't know how they can

1214
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:04,440
get into a but from what I understand

1215
00:42:02,278 --> 00:42:07,349
like the commercial kitchen that you

1216
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,338
know several people can go in there but

1217
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:12,180
they can't go in there at the same time

1218
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:14,818
right so in essence you rent time I get

1219
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:16,558
a s license or permit and you kind of

1220
00:42:14,818 --> 00:42:19,349
piggyback into them and I think I've

1221
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:21,900
seen folks in like entrepreneurs in

1222
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:23,519
Oakland who are trying to basically buy

1223
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:27,358
a big space right and then like

1224
00:42:23,518 --> 00:42:29,818
basically rent it out it's like yeah so

1225
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:32,969
I guess if you are you in a larger area

1226
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:34,440
you know city no adventurer County ok so

1227
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,849
there's very little that they're

1228
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,630
carrying up there Thousand Oaks to be

1229
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:41,789
specific okay um I think they've got one

1230
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,809
Testing Center and one medical I mean I

1231
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:45,539
think if you looked in a place where

1232
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:47,369
there were just more right here might be

1233
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:49,528
good I've also heard that Huntington

1234
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:52,019
Beach there's a couple of cities there

1235
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:53,818
and I've contacted the the the state

1236
00:42:52,018 --> 00:42:56,218
about it and they said there's a

1237
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:58,248
directory they're working on they just

1238
00:42:56,219 --> 00:43:00,179
haven't put it out there yet because

1239
00:42:58,248 --> 00:43:02,488
which I think would be very helpful

1240
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:05,038
towed myself and a lot of people I think

1241
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:05,999
BCC has the list but to see DPH have a

1242
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,039
list on its website

1243
00:43:05,998 --> 00:43:11,038
that's the one that they're saying that

1244
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:13,859
they do yeah they have all the ones that

1245
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:15,900
have permanent and temporary license or

1246
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:18,929
annual and temporary license but they

1247
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:23,358
don't have a specific directory for

1248
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:23,358
shared facilities okay and I don't

1249
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:36,119
okay right right well I've talked

1250
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:38,849
directly with them and the gentleman

1251
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:40,650
Billy I think it was his name I've been

1252
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:43,710
communicating an email with him from the

1253
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:44,579
from the California Department and he

1254
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,960
was saying it's something they're

1255
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:51,000
working on and then they're real close

1256
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:53,250
to publishing the question yes it's a

1257
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,320
viable way to go with the business yeah

1258
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,940
exact or a white label understand those

1259
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,190
facilities that do that that already

1260
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,970
have on but then you kind of if you and

1261
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,849
your license as well

1262
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:05,579
yeah then they've got their license both

1263
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:07,679
entities are licensed right do you have

1264
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:09,329
any other suggestions on how one you

1265
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,059
know other than going getting a building

1266
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:14,969
buying the building and then applying in

1267
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:15,630
you know where the licenses are still

1268
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:19,049
available

1269
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:22,500
I think the barriers to entry are super

1270
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:25,740
high and I think for a manufacturer yeah

1271
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,849
you you need to find a place yeah where

1272
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:30,479
you can do it and then you need the

1273
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:32,519
equipment the kind of shared space idea

1274
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,010
though I mean you can drop your cost of

1275
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:36,780
acquisition by a time it sounds like you

1276
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:39,420
just need to find other folks who are

1277
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,300
close enough to you which like you're

1278
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:44,519
saying it shouldn't there are other

1279
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,940
people in your shoes right you know who

1280
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:49,108
want to do this as well I know I know

1281
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,909
people who are German Cokely and I know

1282
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:54,358
people were trying to do it in San

1283
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:55,980
Francisco it's something that California

1284
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,289
astronomy because obviously everybody

1285
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,460
knows they didn't have the revenue they

1286
00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:02,130
thought they'd have in fact they had

1287
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,630
less revenue with the recreational than

1288
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:07,380
they did the year before with just

1289
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:09,750
medical yeah and it's the restrictions I

1290
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,269
mean they're just you know from seed to

1291
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:15,358
sale is almost impossible you know my

1292
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:17,250
background is manufacturing apparel and

1293
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:19,380
I know how complicated everything yes

1294
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,329
with regulations and everything like

1295
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,358
that so it's so hard to track I would

1296
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:26,699
imagine so I believe they're trying to

1297
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:29,639
you know kind of open it up a little bit

1298
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:30,699
I think they say that they want micro

1299
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:32,230
