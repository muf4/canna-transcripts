1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:11,350
[Music]

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:19,618
are you oh dial yes it's uh we haven't

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,230
actually sat down together with with a

4
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:25,379
microphone in front of us in almost 25

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,179
years probably yeah yeah early nineties

6
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,489
yeah the early name had no idea what

7
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:33,450
year it was you know I think it was 99

8
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:36,210
okay so that's 19 years now 19 years ago

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,530
I think 20 see more easy well rounded up

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,590
to 20 I'm good with that

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,379
and I know neither of us were thinking

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,030
about legalization back then no and you

13
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:48,539
remember we had the discussion at that

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,629
time in the positronic s-- absolutely

15
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,469
hydro versus biome it became known as

16
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:58,259
the great hydro versus bio to hold whole

17
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,960
the High Times Magazine issue or even

18
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,968
two or three laughs were about that

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,379
whole thing you know yes and I remember

20
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:10,439
you won the competition with 51% against

21
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,989
49 so we did a blind test so we had like

22
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,969
a hundred blind samples

23
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:17,699
half of them were hydro and half of them

24
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:19,048
were biome and then we weren't gonna say

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,500
okay the people have to figure out which

26
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:26,280
one was hydro which one is bio and it

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,489
was 51 51 49 that's what Vander was

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,739
there he was supposed to bio me yeah so

29
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:34,228
we set it up but still until now it's

30
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:37,469
funny we're sitting here I still am

31
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:40,109
completely bio in hydro so if you look

32
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,219
at my Newton company how is it is it

33
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:42,750
completely organic

34
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,750
uh-huh and the other half is minerals

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,569
which is not completely hydro but uh-huh

36
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,438
and my menus are still half bio organic

37
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:55,709
and half so you're 50/50 I'm always been

38
00:01:52,438 --> 00:02:00,109
50/50 yeah yeah I have numbers numerous

39
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:02,039
reasons for that main reason is that

40
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:04,019
personally I love bio

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,570
I think organic is the way to go aha

42
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:08,669
because on the long run it's very very

43
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,859
good for our planet but there are some

44
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,089
situations where we have to feed a lot

45
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,220
of people

46
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,170
and where it can be also environmentally

47
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,889
friendly when we recycle all the water

48
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:25,589
and where we can also do a good hydro

49
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:27,000
job that's very very well put I liked it

50
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,920
I'm from Africa I don't forget that I

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,378
know we have serious problems in Africa

52
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,268
with food so where we can feed more

53
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:35,250
people you're right and then we

54
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,049
technically have to do to maybe some

55
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,209
situation to a hydro system you know I'm

56
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:40,530
in favor of there to save lives that's

57
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,420
where I come you're very smart like I

58
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,650
love to be able to debate but I can't

59
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:48,509
that was so well put you know because

60
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,610
water is a pretty is the most precious

61
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:53,239
resource of all yeah sure it's the most

62
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,760
important thing on our planet sure and

63
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,799
so I I congratulations on the new

64
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:02,370
organic line by the way yeah you know me

65
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:05,219
I'm not 5050 no no I go like this I go

66
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,590
no thank you and I usually turn it away

67
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,780
yeah I have a very picky palate yeah I'm

68
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,370
I'm a little bit of a weed snob yeah you

69
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,039
know I don't mean to disrespect anybody

70
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,689
I'm just a very sensitive palate yeah no

71
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,689
listen don't get me wrong now you know I

72
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:21,030
used to be chef in the old days and it's

73
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:24,269
all about I have three three three

74
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,250
Michelin star friends so organic food

75
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,400
for me is by far the better food in the

76
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,379
world also when I smoke but you know I

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,329
also like to play with hydro in a grow

78
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:36,269
room you know sure I like to blow up

79
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:39,450
that plant sure it would nutrients it's

80
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,250
also a hobby so I like to do both when

yeah when you you blend these things

92
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,489
together yeah yeah you don't favor one

93
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:13,439

with just poor old beginnings well it's

98
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:23,579
a little bit the same with shitty

99
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,589
versioning because you know we had this

100
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:28,409

that I can work I also like to taste

118
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,090
much more than any cut to be honored to

119
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,129
be honest talk about real sativa 7 15

120
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:16,799
for 16 weeks and nothing once you get in

121
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,529
America ah come on now you know you have

122

you ever used smoke my Strawberry Cough

123
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:28,019
10 weeks yeah but that's 40% indica no

124
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:29,668
it's 25% now it's more I'm talking about

125
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:31,740
longer I hear you

126
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:33,538
yes you're right I don't don't get me

127
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,430
wrong I love that plan but it's a great

128
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:37,199
I still my favorites that he's not

129
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,069
twenty it's not for it's not it's for

130
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,288
it's it's 40% indigo you think come on

131
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,819
come on yeah come on be fair heights you

132
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:49,680
cannot have you cannot have 10-week

133
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:51,259
plant that's 25% indica so let me ask

134
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,370
you you don't watch a lot of television

135
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,349
okay you don't know I don't have time

136
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,300
unfortunately of course I did I recently

137
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:01,710
did a really interesting episode of

138
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:04,800
explained on Netflix yeah and I was they

139
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:06,538
were asking me about the labeling issue

140
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,970
you know about people going into the

141
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:10,529
shop and wanted to buy indica and being

142
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,810
able to say that this is you know what

143
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:14,219
it is and it's such an issue yeah

144
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:17,280
and what I ended up getting into was

145
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,139
talking about how a plant because it's

146
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,019
everything so mixed up nowadays yes that

147
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,780
a plant can have just like almost like

148
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:27,899
human sexuality you know the range is is

149
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:30,569
why does as can be so you can have an

150
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:33,449
indica plan with sativa growth

151
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:35,370
characteristics yes or a sativa plant

152
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:37,050
with indica growth characteristics yes

153
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,249
okay so you just agreed with me that I

154
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,809
could have a sativa that has ten

155
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:43,949
well characters well I can even tell you

156
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:45,989
even more crazy yeah

157
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,429
yes and no I'm gonna tell you something

158
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,078
that you probably don't know what I just

159
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:51,388
figured out it's like 10 years ago when

160
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,038
I made my Indian movie so there's a lot

161
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:54,899
of seats growing us in the mulana and

162
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,968
provocative Valley in India because of

163
