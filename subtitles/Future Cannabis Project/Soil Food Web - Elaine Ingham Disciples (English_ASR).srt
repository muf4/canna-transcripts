1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,809
I'm gonna get a religious reference in

2
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:09,529
so talking about a Laningham soul food

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:14,759
web there are a lot of Elaine disciples

4
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:16,739
in this conversation today but we like

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,710
if I think of Christianity there are a

6
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,309
lot of Forks right like you had

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,800
Catholicism and then you had the

8
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:25,439
Protestant Reformation where you know we

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,089
agree with 99% of Catholicism but we

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,480
disagree with this one thing and we're

11
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:33,299
gonna go down our own path so can you

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,649
all talk from your own perspectives kind

13
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:39,659
of where you have a different philosophy

14
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:41,879
where your philosophies are slightly or

15
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:44,308
very different than Elaine's like some

16
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,738
of the differences between how you see

17
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:50,308
her approaching things and and your

18
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:52,729
personal approaches well I guess I guess

19
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:55,530
to tie it into your religious thing is

20
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:58,169
within the agricultural sector people

21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,719
are as devout as religious people are

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,240
and you know each religion lives and

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,579
dies by their uniqueness and and

24
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,560
nonetheless so we're I think we're

25
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:16,590
personally in a stage where we're kind

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:19,320
of going from this you know religious

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,759
approach where it's us against them it's

28
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,699
you know you've seen this mineral

29
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,739
analysis against biological analysis

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,439
like Sarah went to the bio nutrient food

31
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,750
conference convention last year and met

32
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,429
up with Todd Harrington another big soil

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,379
food web guy from the East Coast and

34
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,479
they went and talked to John Kemp and

35
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,310
introduced themselves and in that next

36
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,618
segment john kemp is talking about how

37
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,500
you don't need to measure soil organism

38
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:45,000
populations you know and it's just

39
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,590
elaine kind of does this thing i love

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,478
and adore laine i would not be here

41
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,200
without her but she responds in kind

42
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:55,560
with all you need is biology and i think

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,719
we're we're unique is that we

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,780
incorporate everything I come from a

45
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,578
very qualified group of hydroponic

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,680
cultivators in Southern California I

47
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:08,639
absolutely take that into my living

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,330
style strategies you know and so you

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,109
cannot just quickly what are some of the

50
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,650
things you've adopted

51
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,360
hydro community it's the mentality you

52
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,689
know growing up in Southern California

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,190
like like you couldn't you couldn't be

54
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:26,139
fake about it like you had to actually

55
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:29,109
do it or you had to completely be quiet

56
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:31,719
and so in the organic sector it's much

57
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,970
more important to be the Guru know the

58
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:36,240
Guru or regurgitate the Guru and

59
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:40,599
actually be good at growing pot and

60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,280
that's the biggest disabled aspect of

61
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,840
the organic sector is it's much cooler

62
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,640
to be like you can cut down

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,319
three-quarters of your garden each year

64
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,750
and you still be a guru like that's

65
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,819
insane to me from my hydroponic

66
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,709
background like you had to be good or

67
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,780
nobody even listened to a word you said

68
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,209
and so I've taken that mentality and

69
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:03,099
tried to be as regenerative as possible

70
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:04,239
and you know you know just take a

71
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,639
holistic approach

72
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,129
sare comes from medicine my family's in

73
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,899
medicine I was raised in a hospital with

74
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:14,049
my single mom I spent a lot of time

75
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,530
sitting in a nurse management office

76
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:22,000
listening to patient information prior

77
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:24,129
to the HIPAA nonetheless but you know we

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,500
take a holistic approach we take a

79
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:28,930
science-based mathematical approach that

80
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,629
I can approach it without emotions and I

81
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,430
can make a quantified decision that

82
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,409
leads to a result that's either

83
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,709
predictable or unexpected but at least

84
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:41,709
measured so that we can come to a result

85
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:44,560
that can be repeated so Elaine is

86
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:48,340
biology only the a mineral people are

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,890
mineral only and we do as full effort on

88
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,120
every aspect as we can and then we

89
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,208
follow your feed like we're doing

90
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,360
hydroponics holistic biology yeah and so

91
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,250
so what happens is as there's a

92
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,190
disruption in one component of the

93
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,860
system so like within organics or living

94
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:08,379
soil the soil minerality moves at such a

95
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,750
slow pace that if you're correcting a

96
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:12,659
mineral imbalance you might take two or

97
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,250
three harvests to get that under control

98
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,529
you need to balance that with your soil

99
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,180
feeds or your foliar feeds and that's

100
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,279
why all these water only people either

101
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,189
don't do water only or they fail same

102
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,589
water only is because the soil moves so

103
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:30,259
slow you have to you have to correct

104
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:32,989
the context of the situation with soil

105
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:35,240
feeds or foliar feeds while using the

106
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,930
biological population as an indicator

107
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,660
the main anchor of what we do is making

108
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,699
sure that nothing we do reduces

109
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,740
biological populations and I think

110
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,110
that's what makes Sarah and I actually

111
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,949
unique is that lots of people say

112
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,620
biology

113
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:54,529
everybody says soil food web they all

114
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,689
hashtag it but like by what measure are

115
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:59,179
you doing any of these things and we

116
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:01,550
govern all decisions based on what my

117
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,470
wife measures through the microscope if

118
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,370
something I come up with that I think is

119
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,830
a good idea

120
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,410
wipes out populations it obviously was

121
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:12,918
not a good idea from a biological

122
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,810
standpoint because we harmed the most

123
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:15,379
sensitive biological members in the

124
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,100
system

125
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:21,168
and so it might still lead to a yield

126
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,270
but if you're compromising soil

127
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:26,228
organisms you're also compromising plant

128
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:30,699
health because it is also a biological

129
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:34,728
system and I would say just to kind of

130
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:38,060
touch on your your religious little

131
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:39,620
opening there is that you know the first

132
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,610
law of chaos is that the truth is

133
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,978
different for everyone

134
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,889
and that's the beauty of science is that

135
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:48,860
science can unify us on what we can all

136
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:50,719
you know achieve if we adhere to certain

137
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,229
principles whether you're KNF whether

138
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,640
you're soil food web whether you're

139
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:57,889
hydro anything there's certain

140
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,469
principles that underlie biological

141
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:01,970
systems and so that's all we're trying

142
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,860
to say is just quantify it know what

143
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,380
you're doing and and integrate that into

144
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,620
your IPM strategy as your number one

145
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:10,969
thing you do is get that system in place

146
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,220
that you know what you're doing

147
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,530
nutritionally to support that plant and

148
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,930
if there's something that's been going

149
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:21,379
wrong a messenger being sent to you via

150
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,449
a bug or a disease then you start

151
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:25,850
looking okay where it where is the crack

152
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,620
in the system what are you know is it

153
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,539
nutritionally based or we pretty sound

154
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,509
there do we need to do more analytics

155
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:34,310
there do we do we look at like Lydia was

156
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,139
saying do we need to we're seeing a

157
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,728
certain pathogen do we need to look at

158
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:38,310
our water system are we cleaning that

159
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:40,680
enough

160
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:45,209
just those kinds of sound principles but

161
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,550
just to wrap that all in the only real

162
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,810
issue that you know Elaine and I because

163
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,960
I respect the out of her I think

164
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,790
she's brilliant woman but and she came

165
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,829
to me to speak to me about remember we

166
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,360
had talked about driving those viruses

167
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:00,269
out of those plants dudes in the earth

168
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,830
boxes and so she was fascinated because

169
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:05,250
if that's anaerobically driven using

170
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:07,680
lactic acid and sub-irrigation and so

171
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:11,189
what we can do was that what's the

172
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,050
definition aerobic because really it's a

173
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:15,329
certain parts per million of oxygen

174
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,420
present and so in this gray area of

175
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:20,609
interpretation there was which method is

176
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:24,060
it considered an anaerobic delivery or

177
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,740
aerobic delivery and that's where like

178
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,209
my mom was a scientist and she's

179
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,550
brilliant but she always makes sure I

180
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:32,909
remember that you used to be burned

181
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,230
alive because the Sun rotated around the

182
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,360
earth and if you didn't say that they

183
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,780
crucified and that was pretty current

184
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,400
science at the time and so she always

185
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:44,729
kind of let me understand that we only

186
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:46,769
see snapshots and we know as much as we

187
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,870
can right now and we have to work with

188
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,819
that and it doesn't mean that we don't

189
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,610
know but it means that's our limit of

190
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,709
understanding and I think when you get

191
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,080
into this religious dogma what happens

192
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:01,379
is you start to take away reason and you

193
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:04,620
just follow blindly and what you need to

194
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:06,180
be able to do is take the education from

195
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,509
the individual and understand how to

196
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,910
apply it and if other people are having

197
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:14,579
success with contrary methods you need

198
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:17,550
to investigate and try to find out what

199
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:19,169
is the common success of all methods

200
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,020
because something is occurring that's

201
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,930
succeeding and so I think that you know

202
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:27,659
with what we're all trying to do is is

203
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:30,150
understand there's an art and a science

204
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,730
we're trying to merge and we only know

205
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:34,860
so much about either and I think that's

206
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:37,320
where dr. Ingham gets jammed is because

207
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,060
I don't think she could be any smarter

208
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,470
what she is mean she's if you spent some

209
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,019
time with him and she's brilliant and

210
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:47,610
she's got such a nice rhythm with it

211
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:49,230
it's she lives that but that's what

212
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,850
she knows and then when you run

213
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,129
something that you don't have this

214
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:56,339
understanding but it's doing something

215
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:58,110
it can't be wrong and so it's really

216
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,300
trying to bring everyone into the same

217
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,459
area to say hey look with all our

218
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:05,370
understandings we maybe can get our arms

219
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:08,008
around part of the problem but none of

220
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,139
us are so comprehensive that we control

221
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:16,259
the information on a thing because the

222
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:17,850
thing is so complex so totally and it's

223
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:19,709
always evolving and that's what she

224
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,930
always says but what Scott ended up

225
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:23,849
doing and why I kind of why I mean I

226
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:25,708
appreciate what he's done and actually

227
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,259
there was a guy that was one of the

228
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,969
advisors Elaine has these advisors and

229
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:32,310
these are the people that go and do all

230
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,819
her work all the way through and you

231
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:37,888
know for for the street explanation of

232
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:39,919
things is what I'm given right now I'm

233
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:42,659
not the scientific like you guys but

234
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:46,919
basically was in her group of advisers

235
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:49,169
they all perform her work and like the

236
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,958
disciples so to speak and Scott and Sur

237
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:53,549
are those gone through that process and

238
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,309
there was somebody before them my homie

239
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:58,438
and my name Ian Davidson he started a

240
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:00,239
company called biologic crop solutions

241
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:02,009
and a lot of people use but he ended up

242
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,610
moving to Hawaii and getting this other

243
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:08,188
stuff and Scott and Sara when I met

244
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,110
Scott he was basically jumping on as an

245
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:13,169
advisor and learning and doing and

246
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,209
saying the stuff where Ian stopped his

247
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:17,578
work and moved into something else and

248
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:19,588
that one of the examples is going from

249
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:22,919
brewing compost teas to do in these

250
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:25,290
extracts well what Scott did in Inserra

251
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,809
is they took her information and geeked

252
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:30,088
out on it and went deep and deep in the

253
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:31,799
cannabis you know a lot of people kind

254
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:34,110
of with Scott sometimes going do

255
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,359
you grow and stuff and I'm smoking some

256
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,909
of his weed right now but he's been on

257
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,188
big facilities doing big work and I've

258
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:44,759
been to those and even Kevin you've

259
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:46,620
recommended something to a farm to have

260
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,688
me go check out and then after I do my

261
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,879
work I recommend Scott next thing you

262
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:53,578
know the place is blowing up and so

263
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:57,000
there's a day yeah so at the end of the

264
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:59,039
day what's happening what Scott decided

265
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,808
to do was create those events and we did

266
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,419
them with Elaine because the lane was

267
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:04,419
kind of like you know something that

268
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:06,639
really drove a lot

269
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:08,649
people to get in there but Scott's data

270
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,870
that had been collected in cannabis was

271
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,269
the real eye-opener I remember the first

272
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,389
one we did Alain was at the edge of her

273
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,860
seat like holy by the third one I

274
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:20,169
don't know if she can handle the

275
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,778
spotlight that Scott was taking anymore

276
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:24,969
she kind of started deteriorating those

277
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:27,669
events and then we had Kevin jump off

278
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,339
with us and we had some good ones after

279
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:32,649
that and then eventually I'm no longer

280
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:35,260
with the situation that we were doing to

281
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:37,570
create those and so subsequently a lot

282
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:40,899
of that has stopped but the information

283
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,910
was insane that was coming out of that

284
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:46,328
stuff and that's what I cleaned on to

285
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:48,939
was Alain seated but Scott and Sarah

286
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:51,969
sprouted and it's much easier for me to

287
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,350
understand because I've read her papers

288
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,240
or looked at some of her and I

289
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,180
don't even know I don't even speak that

290
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,730
language yeah Scott so that's what you

291
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:04,838
said like I called you on the phone back

292
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:07,089
in like 2013 trying to get some compost

293
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,440
tea brewing products I got you on the

294
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,010
phone and I was asking like really

295
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,449
specific questions about dr. Alaine and

296
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:15,250
regards to my family's farm and you're

297
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:17,500
like look if this is important to you

298
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,809
like you got to find this dr. Lane woman

299
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,759
and figure out what she's talking about

300
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:22,929
and then you you must have had a bowl or

301
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,509
two because you're like look man all

302
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:27,489
these cannabis people they keep saying

303
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:29,110
soil food web but I don't know anybody

304
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,448
that's measuring it like this woman is

305
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,889
saying you know so if you like growing

306
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:36,009
pot and you think you can swing a

307
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:38,409
microscope like get down and I took that

308
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:40,480
really seriously and I did do that and I

309
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:43,000
don't think the market wide really

310
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,519
understands the level of analysis that

311
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,809
we can and have provide and aggregated

312
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,720
and distilled down into really

313
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:51,939
functional advice and it's just I think

314
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,730
it's a symptom of the markets not quite

315
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,980
ready yet still you know we well we were

316
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,899
trying to take that two big AG too and

317
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,870
so I had already spent a shitload of

318
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:04,750
time spraying walnuts with with compost

319
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,240
tea when oh we needed to get it into the

320
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,028
irrigation system spraying it was barely

321
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,409
doing and when you called me you

322
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:14,169
were like yo we're gonna set up this

323
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:16,719
thing and spray these fields or hay or

324
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,449
whatever fields and I was like you've

325
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:25,490
got a drain

326
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:27,230
that I saw we did basically you

327
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,330
know again it was you know the

328
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,460
comprehension of these things in the way

329
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,710
that was laid out to us everybody that I

330
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,480
knew and at that time was we only

331
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,210
sprayed compost tea

332
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,269
you know you maybe put a little into the

333
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:45,110
soil but it was a big spray thing at the

334
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:47,059
time well but what we did was we we did

335
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,980
the data points so both Sarah and I are

336
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,869
capable of doing the full microscope

337
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,389
process and we showed up to a farm

338
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,980
that's exactly what we did and to my

339
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:56,990
knowledge we're the first people to

340
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,779
really provide that to the market and we

341
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,700
went crazy because both you know Sarah

342
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,949
comes from Medicine where lives are on

343
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,259
the line and if you don't document

344
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,270
properly baselines then you know a lot

345
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:10,250
of problems come from that and I had a

346
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:12,350
construction business that had a lot of

347
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,240
liability working in schools so when we

348
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,700
got into commercial cannabis officially

349
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,799
you know the first thing we did was

350
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,720
establish all those baselines so we

351
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,189
could know where we're starting so we

352
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,860
can know where we're going and what we

353
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,290
ended up finding was you know one

354
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,259
particular facility had like a perpetual

355
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:32,449
harvest model and we came in and took

356
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:35,090
samples of each of the populations that

357
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:38,330
were on this two-week cycle and we were

358
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:42,019
able to drill down to a decision that

359
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:44,330
was made by the cultivator that turned

360
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:47,179
things into the direction of mold and so

361
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,420
as far as four years ago we were able to

362
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:53,029
come into a facility and within 48 hours

363
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:55,250
figure out the week that led to all the

364
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:58,279
problems and what that decision was and

365
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,840
I just don't think people are still

366
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,850
really ready to wrap their mind around

367
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,950
that that's an analytical technique that

368
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,470
can be executed and what they can learn

369
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,420
from it but you know the people that

370
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,519
have figured out how to use it you know

371
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,529
back to square one of not saying

372
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,480
anything about it and so people don't

373
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,519
know that it exists because the people

374
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:22,940
that have used it most definitely don't

375
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:25,970
champion it you know more than anything

376
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:28,520
else is that you know she came in were

377
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,160
you know the papers didn't exist on any

378
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,889
of this material you know like so oh my

379
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:36,679
biology wasn't a common discussion

380
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:38,659
certainly wasn't anything that was able

381
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,878
to be communicated to the point that you

382
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:43,429
can have a conversation in an eight or

383
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,810
six-hour class in one day and give

384
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:46,309
people more information than they had

385
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:47,899
ever been exposed to in their entire

386
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:49,399
life you know and they've been

387
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:51,860
cultivating or farming for a real long

388
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,860
time so you know she also comes from

389
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,209
this point I really like Elaine I think

390
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,318
she's she's phenomenal just like

391
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:01,518
everyone else has said that you know she

392
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:03,559
her position at least originally was you

393
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,089
know very defensive against you know

394
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:07,698
traditional AG you know she has a lot of

395
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,589
people that are trying to argue with her

396
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:11,389
she has issues with you know you know

397
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:14,000
grant money and you know who's funding

398
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:15,438
the university that she was working for

399
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,720
at the time and how all that's like

400
00:16:15,438 --> 00:16:20,088
changed and modified in her life and how

401
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,459
that's impacted and driven her to you

402
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:25,910
know author over a hundred papers and

403
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:28,669
really you know initiate the science in

404
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:30,198
this realm in a whole new way and you

405
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:31,818
know just like I said earlier about the

406
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,559
gut microbiology this is something that

407
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:35,299
we're gonna be watching for you know

408
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,129
decades to come

409
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:39,588
all of the different tiny little

410
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:41,360
intricacies of how these microorganisms

411
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,430
work together how they work with

412
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,949
minerals how it all like works with pH

413
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:48,318
and gets into the plant and how all that

414
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:49,969
can be very finicky you know especially

415
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:53,028
with cannabis stream eyestrain or with

416
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,769
different different species of plants in

417
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:57,559
general this is just something that's

418
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:59,419
gonna be developing over time and as we

419
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:01,549
all know you know what works what works

420
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:03,049
for some person you know one guy doesn't

421
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:05,209
work for the next one you know five

422
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:06,769
miles down the road and there's a series

423
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,380
of reasons why that's the case and so

424
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:12,650
you just have to tune into your own your

425
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,750
own farm what your what you've got going

426
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,730
on what the benefits you know what the

427
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,949
drawbacks are of your current situation

428
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,179
and research it to the best of your

429
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:21,589
ability because that's the other thing

430
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,730
too is like we live in a culture where

431
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:25,038
everybody just wants to look at

432
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,380
something on Instagram instead of

433
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,269
actually reading a paper and then in

434
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,770
there if they actually do go read papers

435
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:33,589
they don't know how to determine whether

436
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:35,329
or not this paper is sound if it has you

437
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:36,918
know if there's a large enough sample

438
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:38,658
size if there's any statistical

439
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,120
relevance to what's being what's being

440
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:44,990
spouted at the end in a conclusion and

441
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,659
you know taking those jumping-off points

442
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,558
you know Elaine does really you know

443
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,210
spectacular science but taking the

444
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,799
jumping off points that she's providing

445
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,179
and the stuff that Scott's giving and

446
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:55,940
putting it into practice in your own

447
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:57,830
facility to the best of your ability and

448
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,000
and coming out with something that was

449
00:17:57,829 --> 00:18:00,799
better than what you had started with

450
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,819
before you know and I think that we're

451
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,289
seeing that a you know the quality of

452
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:10,450
the material just increases day by day

453
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:14,710
which is great context is everything

454
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,710
needs to be appropriate to your context
