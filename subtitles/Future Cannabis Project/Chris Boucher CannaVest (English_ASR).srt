00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,400
uh canest we are a publicly traded

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,320
company uh we run a vertical operation

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,000
um our motto is from seed to shelf um so

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,480
basically our business model is that we

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,559
grow all of the hemp about 3,000 Acres

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,160
uh we contract the farmers we cut it we

8
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,439
process it uh we turn it into oil and

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,679
this is hemp uh grown outside the us

10
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,039
right yes currently right now in the uh

11
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:38,200
Netherlands Germany um we've got about

12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,759
3,000 Acres um but currently we actually

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,520
have some um research projects growing

14
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,799
in

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,039
Kentucky um University of Kentucky and

16
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,479
Murray State and we're looking at the

17
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,120
economics there on growing State side

18
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,038
and our goal is to bring the European

19
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:55,280
model um here at the United States and

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,439
Kickstart the industrial hemp Revolution

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,679
and what is the European model European

22
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,920
model is um is on an econom scale in

23
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:05,640
terms of uh the viability of the

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,439
economic price points you know um it's

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,640
basically been in the uh what call like

26
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:12,559
the micro brew or the home brew type

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,319
industry and I think you're going to see

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,159
a big switch from the homebased business

29
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:22,438
in the Cannabis hemp sector to a uh

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,840
large scale um operation with um um like

31
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,599
I said thousands and thousands of Acres

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,200
which will uh basically bring the price

33
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,039
down that way it's affordable and you'll

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,719
get a much larger market share so that's

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,640
kind of where our philosophy Lies We

36
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,640
Sell bulk wholesale that's one of our uh

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,560
foundational uh parts of our business

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,280
model besides the vertical integration

39
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,399
of farming it we in turn take the bulk

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,478
wholesale um and we sell to other

41
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,118
entrepreneurs other businesses around

42
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,478
the world and that way they're

43
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:51,920
developing their their products they're

44
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,519
entering the market they do take a

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,200
market share but um at the same time we

46
00:01:54,519 --> 00:02:00,560
produce our own finished label called

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,320
plus CBD we do a line of capsules

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,920
uh pills uh tinctures um you know a

49
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,038
variety of supplement F supplements and

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,719
nutritional products that uh um that we

51
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,479
manufacture at the same time we are

52
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,000
competing against some of our own

53
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:18,598
customers but uh I think the marketplace

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,239
is wide enough and the market sure that

55
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:22,759
uh there's plenty of room I mean the way

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,878
it's going um the market has just

57
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:28,840
expanded I would say from you know half

58
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:31,000
a million dollars uh four years ago to

59
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,680
probably uh you know well over $100

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,639
million this year so um you know that

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,239
that's quite a jump and we're going to

62
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,158
see it get a lot bigger according to

63
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:43,000
federal law the uh uh the farming Act of

64
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:44,719
2014 legalizes industrial hemp and what

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,840
is industrial hemp and according to the

66
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,479
federal government it's a Cannabis

67
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,959
sativa plant that

68
00:02:49,479 --> 00:03:00,238
registers 3% 0.3% THC um uh per plant

69
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:02,080
and or less and so by having that marker

70
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,360
it basically determines that this plant

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,959
is not psychoactive I call it like the

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,360
poppy seed Bagel Theory you know you buy

73
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,680
a poppy seed there's opiates in those

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,560
poppy seeds how much you know not enough

75
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,040
to uh cause any type of uh you know uh

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,719
psychological activity or you know

77
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,560
addiction since it's derived from

78
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,280
Industrial Hemp I like to call it

79
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,640
agricultural hemp the word industrial

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,000
kind of skews it in terms of its

81
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,238
environmental qualities but yes

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,799
Industrial Hemp as long as it's uh from

83
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,360
that certified seed there's about 60 or

84
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,680
70 different certified varieties

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,200
um that uh the united states recognizes

86
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,159
that are legal in Canada and Europe one

87
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,919
of the great uh assets of the legal

88
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:42,878
opinion of uh CBD being legal in all 50

89
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:46,000
states is that the trace parts of THC

90
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,120
make it legal so we can sell it in you

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,199
know uh health food stores and retail

92
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,759
stores Across America I mean we're in

93
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,639
all 50 states um it just gets bigger and

94
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,359
bigger the more people find out about it

95
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,759
and of course we can't make any claims

96
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,599
of you know medical value whatsoever but

97
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,598
the testimonials and the people out

98
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,719
there in the space that are using the

99
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:08,280
CBD is just um it's astronomic

100
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,079
astronomical the the the testimonies

101
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,079
that are coming from people that have

102
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,480
changed their life for it to be

103
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,239
completely legal you know first all

104
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,319
first off um you know it needs to be

105
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,358
removed from schedule one you know

106
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,360
depending on who uh is looking at the

107
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,879
law according to the DEA and some parts

108
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,759
of the federal government it's still

109
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,439
schedule one so um we have a few

110
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,520
senators and Congress people right now

111
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,560
that there's bills going on that want to

112
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,319
remove pamp Cannabis sativa from

113
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,160
schedule one that way um it opens it up

114
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,759
to the banking sector the investment

115
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,199
Wall Street and uh you'll just see you

116
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,000
know uh a much quicker faster uh growth

117
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,680
for the whole industry I think in the

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,279
future as um legislation becomes more

119
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,400
important uh especially here in

120
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:56,519
California and other states there'll be

121
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,239
much more clarity so right now there's a

122
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,439
little cloudy on legal interpretations

123
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,720
and I I think that's uh The Next Step

124
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:09,959
that really needs to be clarified and uh

125
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:13,520
made 100% illegal and that way uh 100%

126
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:16,279
legal um oh boy yeah so that right there

127
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:19,240
um The Clarity is going to really um

128
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,839
make more I think uh economic sense for

129
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,199
people to invest in it that way there's

130
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,159
no risk the quality of the products from

131
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,079
you know all all different sectors you

132
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,160
know all the different manufacturers you

133
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,879
know I I think in a new industry you

134
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,439
know people have to become compliant

135
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,519
they have to follow compliance

136
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:37,120
regulation laws you know the products

137
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:40,519
that you manufacture um especially our

138
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,439
products at canest um we run GMP

139
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,399
facilities which is a good manufacturing

140
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:47,879
practice so it's basically standardized

141
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:50,120
that if like you were selling a vitamin

142
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,719
to a health food store it has to meet

143
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,439
certain standards and uh operating

144
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,600
procedures for it to be safe for people

145
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,759
to consume it and I think that's the

146
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,400
real issue that maybe you're looking at

147
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,479
there is like um how do you bring

148
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,079
everyone into compliance and uh you know

149
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:07,598
that's what the FDA is there for that's

150
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,800
where U different herbal associations

151
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:13,079
they you know basically are educating

152
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,240
people on um how to package and process

153
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:18,589
their product in a safe manner that's

154
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:26,799
clean healthy and safe

155
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:26,798
