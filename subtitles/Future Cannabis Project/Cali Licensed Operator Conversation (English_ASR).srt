00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,350
my name is Joe and I'm with Sisu

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:13,070
extracts out of Eureka we are a large

4
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:16,219
toll processing facility for biomass

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,539
trim smalls we also move bulk flour from

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,970
Humboldt County down to the rest of the

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:20,868
state I work in sales and procurement I

8
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:22,759
make sure that we've got enough material

9
00:00:20,868 --> 00:00:24,710
to feed the machines on a regular basis

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,609
as well as getting the oil out to the

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,400
cities and bringing that money

12
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,810
ultimately back to my farmers like Miss

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:34,159
Lindsay here and just keep everything

14
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:36,409
moving down the chain hi I'm Vanessa and

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,919
with left coast ventures it recently

16
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:43,459
merged with Soul distro we manufacture

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,379
distribute and into all retail locations

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,009
across California and I'm responsible

19
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:51,439
for the Northern California sales team

20
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:55,009
I'm Lindsay and my husband Ryan and I

21
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,868
own Aloha humble I'm a farmer he and I

22
00:00:55,009 --> 00:01:00,558
have been growing cannabis together

23
00:00:56,868 --> 00:01:02,298
since 1998 we moved from the Midwest and

24
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,140
we've been living in Northern California

25
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:09,140
since 2002 and we have our brand Aloha

26
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,170
Humboldt and we do whole flower

27
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:15,170
pre-rolls we also do jarred eights and

28
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:20,000
we're moving into having half ounces as

29
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:26,629
well and we saw our biomass Joe here and

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,150
it's been a wonderful relationship yes

31
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:31,789
uh-huh we do collaborations with peak

32
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,250
and we're also working with the Humboldt

33
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,840
herb Council so we are we have upcoming

34
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,609
collaborations we've actually been doing

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,400
collaborations with peak since 2016 so

36
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:46,870
why don't you guys talk a little bit

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,400
about the relationship between

38
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,680
cultivator

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,750
manufacturer and distributor in today's

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,920
California market sure and I think it

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,209
would just make sense to go along with

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,710
the time line so if you just want to

43
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:01,390
talk about right up to what you produce

44
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:02,949
and then I'll jump in right up to what

45
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,849
we produce and then we can describe the

46
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:09,368
handoff yeah my my year starts in

47
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:12,819
January you know as a farmer we start

48
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:14,889
popping seeds in January and we also

49
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:17,079
keep Mother's of genetics that we've had

50
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:19,389
for years we have a bubblegum strain

51
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,990
that we've had since 1998 growing

52
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,149
together

53
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,780
it's a heirloom strain from the Midwest

54
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:29,409
and we still grow it on our farm today

55
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,150
so farming is an extensive process you

56
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:33,400
know there's vetting new strains

57
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,500
figuring out what works on our farm and

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,150
then you know ultimately giving love and

59
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,900
attention to all of our plants all

60
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,360
season long and we have greenhouses and

61
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,090
full season so we do two runs in our

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,690
greenhouses and we farm with lunar

63
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:52,360
cycles so we harvest our first death in

64
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:55,209
July and this year it was really nice

65
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,239
because we we harvested under a lunar

66
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,620
eclipse we had some extra help and we

67
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,980
were able to pull down our greenhouses

68
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,930
all under the full moon at night so we

69
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:06,609
keep the temperature under 70 degrees

70
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,000
while we're harvesting to maintain the

71
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:12,040
highest tripping profile that we can and

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,409
you know it's it's a really long season

73
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:18,219
and once that happens and we we harvest

74
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:20,560
and we process and we replant and and

75
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:22,919
then we're kind of gliding then in July

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,509
and at that point is when we're doing

77
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,319
processing of our pre rolls and we're

78
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:28,479
drawing eights

79
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,500
and Ryan and I have done most of that

80
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:35,709
process ourselves and then we'll have

81
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,870
you know other pieces to the puzzle so

82
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,759
then we have trim and we have you know

83
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,379
the smaller buds

84
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,789
and you know that's where we can come in

85
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:45,699
and do collaborations with other

86
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:48,400
companies and so all of our packaged

87
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:50,829
branded goods are sold through up north

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,280
Humboldt distribution and they've been

89
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,709
really great to us our pre rolls are

90
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,689
manufactured at Tru Humboldt and then we

91
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,180
work with a couple of different

92
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:02,489
extractors and

93
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,799
been really wonderful for us this year

94
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:07,200
and you really have to have big

95
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,060
partnerships because you can't do it all

96
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,738
yourself you have to have a distributor

97
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,560
to move your product to market because

98
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:18,569
farmers can't do direct-to-consumer

99
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,038
sales so having relationships with other

100
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:22,349
people that you can trust

101
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:24,569
they have transparency and integrity

102
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:29,340
means a lot to the farmer and it's

103
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:31,439
sometimes hard to find so where where

104
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:32,879
her at world would end with trim it'll

105
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,250
then come into my world in that same

106
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,319
form and we basically work for farmers

107
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,569
and distributors have finished goods

108
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,610
like both of these ladies and so when

109
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:43,469
her trim enters our system we go through

110
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,479
a pesticide testing process we split

111
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,850
every load up into 50 pound batches and

112
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,288
do a micro extraction using acetone this

113
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,960
allows us to see the concentration of

114
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:53,610
pesticides at a crude oil level which is

115
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,439
about half of that what it would be in a

116
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,030
finished concentrate product so is the

117
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,288
way we pre-screen materials and I can I

118
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:59,969
can tell you after multiple rounds of

119
00:04:58,288 --> 00:05:02,069
testing the lady here produces

120
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,990
absolutely fantastic non-detect material

121
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,459
which is rare even even in Humboldt

122
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,569
County it's rare to hit full non-detect

123
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,948
it's very difficult the standards are

124
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:09,629
incredibly high

125
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,500
so we searched for material like this

126
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:12,959
and then goes into our extraction

127
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,819
process which involves cryogenic ethanol

128
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,370
extraction falling film evaporation

129
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,949
degassing d volatilizing and d tarping

130
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,449
of the oils and then we go into thin

131
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:22,620
film distillation to produce a finished

132
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,329
distillate oil which is what you

133
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,500
commonly see in vapour cartridges it's

134
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:27,240
used to manufacture edibles and a

135
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,860
variety of other things but I'd say the

136
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,220
line shit really goes out in paper cards

137
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,590
like yours and from there we'll take the

138
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,630
finished distillate will recombine with

139
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:39,598
cannabis derived terpenes to produce a

140
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:41,158
formulated oil and then companies like

141
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:42,689
sole distro here who manufacture

142
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:44,908
finished brands will purchase from us in

143
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:47,069
bulk we also handle transportation from

144
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:48,750
the farm to us from us to the buyer and

145
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,610
then we bring the money back to us and

146
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,279
of the money made from her oil we

147
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,379
returned 70% of that total back to the

148
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,509
farmers and our farmers trusting us to

149
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,370
go through that process and timeline all

150
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,719
the way to payout is what has really

151
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,590
allowed our company the opportunity to

152
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,330
grow so your

153
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:12,179
according to your clients specifications

154
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:13,800
the oil buyers distillation as a process

155
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,209
is really really consistent it's like

156
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,560
water filtration there's not really a

157
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:20,099
bunch of different water filtration

158
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,930
methods we kind of as far as

159
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,520
formulations absolutely so typically

160
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,930
when working with a buyer like these

161
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,299
guys in fact very much with these guys

162
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,480
we send out 12 sample formulations from

163
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,980
three different cultivars and allowed

164
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,180
them to select from those and then we

165
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,560
chase down the rest of the source

166
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,780
material to generate that terpene

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,220
profile and then we do the the actual

168
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:39,659
formulation and blending in-house that

169
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,190
way we have a completely finished oil

170
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,050
ready to go so that when they approach

171
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,579
manufacturing they can load in their

172
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,199
feedstock load in their hardware and

173
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,060
just go right to production immediately

174
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,199
and not have to worry about sourcing or

175
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,240
selection of all those things we kind of

176
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,918
remove that burden to let her focus on

177
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,269
farming and let these guys focus on

178
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,609
selling because those are both much more

179
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:58,289
involved jobs then our position is kind

180
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:09,889
of a mechanical industrial approach to

181
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:09,889
most processes all different forms

182
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:13,769
correct we're looking for a variety of

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,720
materials basically all materials with

184
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,978
over three to five percent THC work well

185
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,350
for us as long as they're compliant with

186
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,609
state regulations the majority of the

187
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,200
farms I'm dealing with by number

188
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,310
definitely come from Humboldt Mendocino

189
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,829
and Trinity counties we've been through

190
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,019
around 200 farms and around 150 of them

191
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:29,069
are from that three County region that's

192
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,199
really home base for us

193
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:33,089
we do however source from outside the

194
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,709
region as well because also the

195
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:36,299
cultivation in Humboldt is seasonally

196
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,918
limited because of the mountainous

197
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,538
climate and because of actually having a

198
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,609
real winter unlike some other parts of

199
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:43,409
California that stay relatively warm

200
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,569
there are lags in production that cause

201
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,100
us to go source in warmer climates so we

202
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:50,348
do work with farmers throughout the

203
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:54,999
entire state basically from yeah

204
00:07:50,348 --> 00:08:01,118
biomass of varying quality and with

205
00:07:54,999 --> 00:08:02,469
different generally and I think she's a

206
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:04,299
great example of this the farther you

207
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:06,848
are from humans the better your chances

208
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:08,438
are humans have created quite a few

209
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:10,028
problems and the regulations facing us

210
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,409
from a pesticide standpoint are the

211
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:13,088
toughest that you can imagine in

212
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:15,368
anything cannabis on the Shelf stays

213
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:17,829
cleaner than any foods you can go buy at

214
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:19,149
any lovely grocery store it's the

215
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,348
testing is absolutely Carl I've spent

216
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:22,569
I've spent close to twenty thousand

217
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:24,009
dollars in testing on her farm alone in

218
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,348
the past one or two seasons it's

219
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,360
incredibly intensive and these guys have

220
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:29,978
to work an enormous number of creative

221
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,250
ways to get their product completed and

222
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:34,718
finished without without using something

223
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,219
somewhere along the line that's

224
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,930
inadvertently contaminated whether it be

225
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:39,939
a water stream coming from a spring or

226
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,138
the neighbors spraying but yeah Humboldt

227
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:43,360
County we find much more clean material

228
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:45,789
and down south we find significantly

229
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,110
more material but higher contamination

230
00:08:45,789 --> 00:09:22,179
rates because they're surrounded by

231
00:08:47,110 --> 00:09:24,730
industrial a very timely question we're

232
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:26,649
definitely very concerned I mean I think

233
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,350
especially if you've gotten to Kansas

234
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:32,318
you probably got in a lot of people did

235
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,639
when it was medicinal the thought is

236
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:35,649
protecting people helping people

237
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:39,278
actually the opposite of getting sick

238
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:42,429
right so we're not concerned you know

239
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:45,278
about marketing just because it doesn't

240
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:49,568
affect our products right clean products

241
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:52,679
I'm but it is it is very sad and and we

242
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:52,679
want to reassure people that

243
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,509
double down on making that good stance

244
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:02,469
PQ well I think that a lot of farmers up

245
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,269
in Humboldt County have for the longest

246
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,220
time been using these practices that

247
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:09,009
give you clean tests before they were

248
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,660
required so I think for us when when

249
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,580
there is this all of these changes and

250
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:14,919
new testing and you know there's always

251
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,690
the hiccups with needing new tests and

252
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,719
maybe relabeling and things like that

253
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,340
but there is never a concern that our

254
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,600
flower or a trim would fail because

255
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:27,250
we've always used practices that are

256
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,139
environmentally conscious and I think

257
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,299
that it'll affect the industry it could

258
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,000
affect the industry in a really positive

259
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:36,120
way because when you look at the testing

260
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,679
and the stringent testing that's done

261
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,320
you're like Joe said finding the

262
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,899
cleanest products in the legal market I

263
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,270
would be much more concerned to go and

264
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:48,399
get you know your cartridge from your

265
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:49,960
friend down the street because he's not

266
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,209
going through the heavy metal testing so

267
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,190
you don't know what kind of material is

268
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:57,190
actually in what you're getting and

269
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,570
that's scary to me so if you're doing it

270
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,150
for a health reason or for just

271
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,310
relaxation nobody wants to have lead in

272
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,789
their distillate so it's pretty

273
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:05,789
important

274
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,639
well and I think I think there's really

275
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,610
clear correlative evidence that shows

276
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,899
that there is an agent being used in the

277
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,730
black market as a cutting agent that

278
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,439
turns one jar of high potency distillate

279
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,899
into two jars of medium potency just

280
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,460
allowing you to make twice as much money

281
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,829
its primary function is to look stable

282
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,379
and firm at room temperature and because

283
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:34,629
that's a mark of high potency distillate

284
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:36,429
the opposite is true with everything

285
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:38,710
that we do we need terpenes with very

286
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:40,179
low viscosity so we can get a good flow

287
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,129
rate so the cartridges can function

288
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:43,539
right so you can get a great vapor rate

289
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:45,909
and vapor production rate given the

290
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:49,029
aperture size in the cartridges so this

291
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:50,559
material is not present in any licensed

292
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,120
or permitted facility at all it's the

293
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,469
exact opposite of the effect that we're

294
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,509
trying to generate and it's really used

295
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,830
to rip people off so the the reasonable

296
00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:00,210
response is that we could see to this

297
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:02,320
from a regulatory perspective are

298
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,759
significant enforcement on cartridge

299
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,290
manufacturing the heavy metal

300
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,490
contamination is a real issue and

301
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:08,439
there's there's an issue with that

302
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,850
across the board and it is difficult to

303
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,610
find clean materials and the testing has

304
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,290
to be rigorous to make so regulations if

305
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,399
anybody wants to add vitamin E acetate

306
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:16,990
to the testing requirements you

307
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:18,730
absolutely can we'll spend the money to

308
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,560
do it it's not in anything on shelves

309
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,879
this is really occurring in the black

310
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,500
market I think the most reasonable

311
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:25,120
response that we could see would be

312
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,059
governmental measures created to help

313
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,679
clamp down on production and transport

314
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:31,869
of this bad material and really allowing

315
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,159
cannabis legalization into multiple

316
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,379
states the black market will continue to

317
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,730
exist until there's higher quality

318
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,129
better price product available

319
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,720
everywhere and the best way we can get

320
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:42,250
there is allowing legal companies like

321
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,990
these folks who put a lot of time and

322
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,519
effort and enormous amounts of testing

323
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,830
into producing something that meets all

324
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,299
of these regulations you just have to

325
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,710
let them go do their jobs and if these

326
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:52,000
guys are making it for you you have

327
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,100
nothing to worry about because we know

328
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,710
when we put cannabis in people nobody

329
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,940
dies and there's really folks out there

330
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,220
in the black market who are responsible

331
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,110
for this

332
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,960
but I know a few months ago there was a

333
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,090
real lack of biomass available are you

334
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,090
is there gonna be enough for your needs

335
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,519
so this is the whole game in extraction

336
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,860
lots of people have built really really

337
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,029
big extraction facilities and I referred

338
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,519
him as big guns but they're all out of

339
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:23,529
bullets I think a lot of people are

340
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,699
running out I think there's also very

341
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:27,129
specific issues coming online with

342
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,629
metric metric is online and big

343
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:30,939
operators are using it now they had a 30

344
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:32,049
day window in which pre-existing

345
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,430
materials could be brought in and now

346
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:35,649
that that walls completely closed down

347
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:37,269
they can only operate with fully metric

348
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,649
compliant farms and fully metric

349
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,389
compliant distros with fully metric

350
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:41,590
compliant materials and so because of

351
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:46,840
that a lot of the loopholes are really

352
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:49,480
kind of ending and there's a significant

353
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,530
now we're not it's not impacting us as

354
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,210
hard because we have a really

355
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,319
spectacular farmer Network throughout

356
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,930
the state

357
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,300
our tradition of paying farmers more has

358
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:59,319
gotten us more farmers and so we've

359
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:01,979
built our business to be a hundred

360
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,210
metric compliant from the beginning and

361
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,500
because of that when this change is

362
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,790
occurring it's not negatively impacting

363
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,139
us in the same way but I don't think

364
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:09,789
that's the major sentiment the industry

365
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,860
I think a lot of people struggle with

366
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:14,049
finding consistent supply of both flour

367
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,909
and trim across the board everything is

368
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:18,599
in scarcity right now and harvest is

369
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:18,600
right around the corner

370
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:27,500
the soul disco is really unique company

371
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:31,430
he started manufacturers you had

372
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,799
products on a quality products and

373
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:35,209
brands on the market and that you were

374
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,359
distributing yourself and then you

375
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:40,730
opened up the distribution so it's kind

376
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,620
of like the retailer like you guys there

377
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,060
has their own products you know their

378
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:51,529
own growth but they're also selling

379
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:53,989
other clocks a great question yeah I

380
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:57,169
think we're really really careful how we

381
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:59,600
curate our portfolio we want all the

382
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:02,599
brands actually feel like family so it's

383
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,450
not like three P Alvers you know

384
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,759
in-house brands at all on most of the

385
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:10,040
brands we manufacture and some some of

386
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,169
our in-house brands most we do

387
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:14,569
manufacture and distribute the few that

388
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:16,849
we just distribute we treat them the

389
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,950
same we love them just the same we

390
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,259
really curated the portfolio so there

391
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,270
would be something for everyone and no

392
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:25,549
one would overlap so there's no fighting

393
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:27,590
between the brands for shelf space at

394
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,019
all we believe there's room for everyone

395
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,610
in the industry but we want to make sure

396
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:34,879
we highlight the best brands the

397
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:37,340
cleanest brands for sure as well as

398
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:39,080
sustainable when it comes to other

399
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:44,139
ingredients trying to make sure those

400
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,139
organic healthy more wellness

401
00:15:46,870 --> 00:16:28,830
there are four more grand than there are

402
00:15:50,710 --> 00:16:32,440
a great question

403
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:34,839
it's definitely highly saturated and

404
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:40,480
honestly people will tell you cartridges

405
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:42,880
the most are some of the most saturated

406
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,670
part of the market yeah so if you go

407
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,659
into a new buyer meeting spoiler they

408
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:51,338
probably don't want to hear about your

409
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:52,870
cartridges and so if you I mean

410
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:55,720
obviously one of the things we do is

411
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,879
partner with good people one of our big

412
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,879
brands and the brands that we work with

413
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,899
closely together is Marley natural and

414
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,660
part of that brand it's started by the

415
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:06,099
Marley family with us so started part of

416
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,110
it is giving back to the community

417
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,698
working with smaller farms farms like

418
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:12,539
we're in the black market getting into

419
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:15,610
the legal market helping them through

420
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:17,889
mostly in the Emerald triangle right

421
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:20,169
this is why we get along so well

422
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,490
my answer is all cannabis Drive charts

423
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,890
so it's really just the highest quality

424
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,808
as possible obviously marketing has

425
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:30,190
something to do with it but on it

426
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:33,730
honestly you have to be real transparent

427
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,990
good people I think people especially in

428
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,808
Northern California I can speak for

429
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,859
mostly can see if you're authentic or

430
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:43,629
not so we're trying to bring healthy

431
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,729
amazing products to the market support

432
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,960
the community that has been around us

433
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:52,389
and

434
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,889
I don't currently um I'll do what needs

435
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:56,618
to be done of course we got a C

436
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:57,969
competitive but that hasn't been an

437
00:17:56,618 --> 00:18:14,980
issue I've come across that much

438
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:18,548
recently there's only so much space in

439
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,618
our brain you know for brand so we have

440
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:23,220
a lot of space but I see you tonight so

441
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:28,298
what are your feelings

442
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:32,669
I think that I think that there's going

443
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:36,429
to be more consumer education behind the

444
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:39,309
whole the holistic approach of flower

445
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:42,509
and also of working with people that use

446
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:46,089
cannabis drivetrains and doing things in

447
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:48,940
really environmentally and community

448
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:51,158
conscious way and I think that people

449
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,600
will start to value more where it's

450
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:54,429
coming from and there are a lot of

451
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:57,038
brands out there but if you are

452
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:58,720
authentic you don't have to be in every

453
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,658
store but if you're in the right ones

454
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,368
that align with your brand then I think

455
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:06,100
that you can reach the consumer that

456
00:19:03,368 --> 00:19:09,658
that will value the small farms and

457
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:09,658
sun-grown flower that's the point

458
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:20,588
[Music]

459
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:36,109
and I think budtender education is

460
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:38,959
really important too because there the

461
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:41,329
door the doorway to the consumer so if

462
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,340
these bud tenders can be more educated

463
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:47,388
and I always like to bring up the

464
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:50,148
analogy of wine and and beer and alcohol

465
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:54,788
and you know right now I feel like the

466
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:57,079
market is really ruled by the THC

467
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:59,359
percentages and milligrams and

468
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,398
everything is all about is it higher you

469
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,158
know Kenya is it the cheapest for the

470
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:05,898
most THC milligrams and for me I like to

471
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,580
think well I don't like to go to the

472
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:10,579
store and buy moonshine and drink

473
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:12,589
moonshine because it's the highest but I

474
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:15,678
think that if you can have a more

475
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:17,808
educated approach to your products and

476
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,110
know where it's coming from know that

477
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:23,298
there's value in in what's going in the

478
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:26,089
intention that's going into your product

479
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:27,829
and who's growing it and and what their

480
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:29,750
intentions are I think a lot of big

481
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:32,658
companies have a lot of just finance

482
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,220
based intention and and small farmers

483
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:35,650
don't yeah we've just had this

484
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:45,190
conversation

485
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:48,759
the difference between all of us are

486
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:50,920
existing simultaneously in both she is

487
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,740
producing crass flour and then producing

488
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,910
a byproduct commodity of trim and then

489
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,279
selling it to me which I further

490
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,560
commoditize by refining into an oil but

491
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,200
then I receive a craft product of

492
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:05,789
terpenes for the blending and then they

493
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,210
formulate that into the flavors and

494
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:08,889
representations they would want to

495
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,690
attach to one of their brand lines and

496
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,580
then they craft a finished product and

497
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,710
again it produced a craft product that

498
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:17,710
has gone through and its quality focused

499
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:20,759
it's not like this quantified THC high

500
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,470
higher THC lower cost it's a quality

501
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,779
that's really what we're focused on and

502
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,610
what we've seen - again our product

503
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:28,539
lines like 16 different brands of over

504
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:30,369
hundred SKUs but what we've seen

505
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:34,329
specifically in our flour our Marley

506
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:36,309
natural brand is that we will only work

507
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:38,710
with small local farms right that are

508
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:43,210
just sustainably purchase organic in all

509
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:46,000
other senses of the word and I think

510
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,650
that the farmers you can probably speak

511
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,900
better to this but it seems like the

512
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,730
farmers are more worried they know their

513
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,680
quality right it's more worried about if

514
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,700
a big company's gonna come and rip them

515
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:59,470
off and try to undercut them right and

516
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,600
so the goal is never to do that to

517
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,370
support the people that are you know

518
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,809
giving you this quality product

519
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:06,759
obviously a lot of them have been in the

520
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:08,919
community a lot longer than some of the

521
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:12,640
newer companies and making sure we all

522
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:18,660
rise together you know it's interesting

523
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:22,090
because I hear the same thing from that

524
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:23,550
as important as the final product it's

525
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:27,959
the process

526
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:31,919
how you get there it's our culture it's

527
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,900
you know my husband I knew that going

528
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,360
into the legal market was going to be

529
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:40,980
incredibly difficult Humboldt County had

530
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:44,149
has the most stringent process to be

531
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:47,130
compliant we removed for greenhouses

532
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:50,820
fixed a rock slide you know we started

533
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:54,390
with 43,000 square feet and we had to

534
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:57,059
scale back to 28 and it's because we

535
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:00,480
needed to fix things that had been done

536
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:03,539
on our property in pre legalization that

537
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:13,289
it was not environmentally sound so

538
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:17,220
we've taken all of that ya know our farm

539
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:21,359
is grandfathered in under the legacy you

540
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:23,850
know pre 2.0 so we are not able to

541
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,139
expand we we're in we're in the middle

542
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:28,109
of nowhere we're on the top of a

543
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:32,450
mountain in the middle of the forest you

544
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:34,709
know we're very far removed from any

545
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:40,380
well I drove down today and it took

546
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:51,329
about six and a half hours it's not a

547
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:53,550
bad way to end your day one of the best

548
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,839
aspects of our jobs all these folks out

549
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:56,159
there especially folks who are headed

550
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:58,470
into the compliant world and have the

551
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,180
capacity to both understand acknowledge

552
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,860
and create everything required to move

553
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,450
through regulations they also tend to

554
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,669
create really beautiful wonderful places

555
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,690
and solid communities around them so one

556
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,009
of the best parts about my job I don't

557
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,660
get to do it as much as I used to but I

558
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:11,609
used to everyday be in the field driving

559
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,920
to farms like hers honking my horn at

560
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:15,119
gate offering people cold drinks doing

561
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,640
everything we could to get these guys

562
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,599
attention and then when they let you

563
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,790
through the gates you come into these

564
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,439
beautiful forested hills that just break

565
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:24,509
with breathtaking views sometimes all

566
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,640
the way to the ocean or giant redwoods

567
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:28,650
horses and cattle and like great dogs

568
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,150
everywhere it's really heaven up there

569
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,100
it's really nice and the weather is

570
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,110
mostly nice especially during the

571
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:35,339
working season and there's really good

572
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:36,490
people around I refer to him as high

573
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:37,959
quality cooks

574
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:45,160
everybody everybody's weird but

575
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:47,410
everybody's capable and also really

576
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,808
really hard worker and not just in the

577
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:52,750
dirt right like also now with the

578
00:24:49,808 --> 00:24:55,539
paperwork metric and regulation like if

579
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,519
you're coming from black market you work

580
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:59,079
your ass off to do it and you should be

581
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,910
rewarded for that you should definitely

582
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,609
be part of part of the party you know I

583
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:06,130
went into an independent wine shop a

584
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:07,779
couple of months ago it was not here

585
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:12,790
actually I was visiting my brother was

586
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:15,639
in Florida I walked in and pieces of

587
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:21,750
paper telling the story and the history

588
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:21,750
of that cuz of the wine of the winemaker

589
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:30,159
it gives you a connection to what you're

590
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,480
doing and what you're consuming and

591
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,210
especially when it's something like

592
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,370
cannabis you know is giving you a lifted

593
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:39,308
you know different experience and

594
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:43,509
perceptive change it's really good to

595
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:45,220
connect with the origin I think anything

596
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:46,779
you're putting in your body - or on your

597
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,339
body you're gonna be wanting to make

598
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,899
sure it's high-quality and hearing where

599
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:52,509
it came from always helps with that I

600
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,730
think it circles back to education

601
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:57,099
though what you were saying it's really

602
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,720
hard I mean if you can imagine part of

603
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:00,369
Education about genders is on us right

604
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,829
which is great it's like one of my

605
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:04,119
favorite parts of the job honestly but

606
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:07,119
they're the ones really on the front

607
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:09,489
lines telling the end-user what they're

608
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,949
getting but they only have like a couple

609
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:14,769
minutes at our register so it's hard to

610
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,330
get the right info across and also does

611
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:18,609
anyone actually want to read like

612
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:20,889
paragraphs about all of our farmers like

613
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:22,869
I wish they did but it doesn't seem to

614
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,700
be the case unfortunately so you have to

615
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:27,489
marketing wise figure out the snippets

616
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,200
that try to buzzwords like points to get

617
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:32,589
across

618
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,019
you know this is the challenge but

619
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:37,059
crazily I keep thinking about it all the

620
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:40,089
time because it's a challenge that has

621
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:41,829
to be met one way or another because the

622
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:43,629
large players the big commodity

623
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:45,819
producers are there and they're not

624
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,130
going away and they and I know this

625
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:51,759
because I covered them they have their

626
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:53,980
story there's a lot of different

627
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,359
qualities of each you could say a lot of

628
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,549
things right we know this from marketing

629
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,979
going to the grocery store you can say

630
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,539
natural you can say you know so I'm it's

631
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,650
if you care like in about like

632
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:04,299
researching making sure you're going

633
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:07,090
with brands and products that you can

634
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:09,039
trust really but I think then you also

635
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:10,539
have to try to do if you ever try to do

636
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,430
we have a lot of unique products the

637
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:14,079
other people don't have coach Crean like

638
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,730
psychoactive body wash no one has that

639
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:34,089
or Delta eight rich cartridge is

640
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:36,549
different THC they're reviles right now

641
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:50,439
by everybody I'm one of them and I feel

642
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:51,909
that what's really exciting about an

643
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,430
opportunity where I get to work in a

644
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,960
system like this because some of the

645
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:57,759
products we feel like Marlee naturals

646
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,990
for these guys are interested in caring

647
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,190
well we're not carrying a full paragraph

648
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,109
cuz you're right there's a lot to read

649
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,880
there they do help carry the farm name

650
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:05,019
and the genetic originators like we have

651
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,970
some really exciting stuff coming down

652
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:08,950
the pipe with some really original local

653
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,839
Humboldt County genetics blueberry

654
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,700
muffin done by some local guys out there

655
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:14,709
it's lovely and so when we can share

656
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,299
that information like Aloha here is one

657
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,590
of the best branded farms in Humboldt

658
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:19,450
County she's got beautiful packaging

659
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:22,240
she's everywhere all the time the colors

660
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,500
are great it's clean its professional so

661
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,089
it's really nice is when you see her

662
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,799
name on her package and then you see her

663
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:28,689
name on another brands package and then

664
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,309
you see these brands crossing places you

665
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,900
begin to become familiar with this these

666
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:33,460
farms and these entities both its

667
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,670
cartridge manufacturers and extraction

668
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,630
houses and farming it's the way we

669
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,130
support each other and then when these

670
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,570
old school folks have seen her name in

671
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,980
two or three places and their name in

672
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:43,000
two or three places in our name in two

673
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,579
or three places and all those things

674
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,140
were good we can kind of have a rising

675
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:48,669
to the top of your best players out

676
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,320
there so it is important to tell the

677
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,550
story in a brief way that connects the

678
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,480
whole supply chain because the bummer is

679
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:54,279
when you bought wheat a long time you

680
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,450
just got weed from Brad right you

681
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,240
couldn't you didn't know the strain you

682
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:03,100
were getting was necessarily true but

683
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:04,660
exactly and so today we can know that I

684
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:06,879
want to smoke weed that is grown on a

685
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,370
beautiful mountaintop around bears and

686
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,070
eagles and then it is extracted at a

687
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:14,289
Tier one lab using the best you know

688
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:16,720
GMP processes available and then

689
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:18,250
assembled at a final place supporting

690
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,809
brands and families who are going to

691
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,519
stand and be in the industry for a long

692
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:22,839
time and have been here for a long time

693
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,099
and then when you have that complete

694
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,629
story and if you consistently make

695
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:27,279
choices in that realm

696
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,510
you'll consistently contribute to people

697
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,710
like this and that's what I think those

698
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:31,599
folks who've been around for a minute

699
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,370
would want to see it is important to do

700
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,409
that education because there are a lot

701
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:38,049
of big companies the big guns out there

702
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:40,019
that are trying to use and tell the

703
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:43,359
farmer the small farmers story in

704
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:45,309
perpetuity with with working with them

705
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:47,799
or without working with them and I think

706
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:49,599
that there's a lot to be said with doing

707
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,039
the education and finding out like are

708
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,059
they actually still working with that

709
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,129
farm are

710
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:56,289
are those people still involved with the

711
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:59,560
collaboration instead of just seeing

712
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:02,319
that these bigger places claim natural

713
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:04,990
or or whatever like you do see in the

714
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:07,240
grocery store and seeing if it actually

715
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:28,900
trickles back to the farmer that's like

716
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:32,049
authentic yeah okay so we have a lot of

717
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:35,890
exciting things going on I have always

718
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:38,319
loved to do food and wine pairings and I

719
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:42,310
think that there is a whole other aspect

720
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:45,460
to cannabis for these new newly can i

721
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:47,859
curious you know baby boomers and people

722
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,539
that are you know maybe not used to

723
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:52,179
smoking because it always came with that

724
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:54,159
paranoia of it being illegal and now

725
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,539
they can come and check it out and they

726
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,600
don't want to have something that's just

727
00:30:55,539 --> 00:31:00,399
gonna you know be so strong that they

728
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:03,669
feel uncomfortable and I think that

729
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,740
there's a lot of ways to educate through

730
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:08,259
events where you get together and talk

731
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,779
to people like this we were involved

732
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:13,690
with a high dining event at Joshua Tree

733
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:16,450
last September on the full moon and they

734
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:19,029
paired our blueberry cookies with a rose

735
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:21,730
a and a Moroccan dinner and it was a

736
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:25,480
really really amazing experience the

737
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:28,509
dank Duchess was there we had you know a

738
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,490
bunch of other great educators roaming

739
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:33,220
educators they say so you get to come

740
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:36,519
and have the wonderful curated meal you

741
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,710
know have like welcome CBD spritzer and

742
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:41,160
then have the wine paired dinner and so

743
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:44,640
we're doing more of that with

744
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:47,420
so it's um it goes vote so that one only

745
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,430
had five milligrams and the whole dinner

746
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:53,840
because the trend is to go away from the

747
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:58,620
dinner you know if you want to you know

748
00:31:53,839 --> 00:32:01,349
yeah well it's so strong especially if

749
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:03,359
you're not used to consuming and and you

750
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:07,649
know edibles there just can be so so

751
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:09,869
strong so it was very light and it was a

752
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:11,850
very small group so that the host could

753
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:13,889
really check in with everyone and then

754
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:15,869
I've been working with this woman named

755
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,670
Cara and she does food flour future

756
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:20,639
we've done an event down in Venice Beach

757
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:22,860
and then also in San Diego and she does

758
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,980
pairings so it's not infused and she

759
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:28,199
just pairs the cannabis with the course

760
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,960
and so we're doing an event with her on

761
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,600
October 5th I'm down in LA and then

762
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,960
we're also doing an event with the herbs

763
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:39,389
Somali a Jaime Evans and she does the

764
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,130
pairings with the wine and a

765
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,630
three-course meal and so they're

766
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:50,370
actually going to be pairing three of

767
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:52,680
our strains with a course dinner well

768
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:54,779
right now we've been on our farm for

769
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,789
about four years growing out to her for

770
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:59,549
much longer but every farm is so

771
00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:01,470
different so we're at 2600 feet and so

772
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:03,329
it we've been really trying to find what

773
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,279
works on our farm so we've done quite a

774
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:07,139
few more strains than we normally would

775
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,019
but we're doing white Tahoe cookies

776
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,910
which we've really it loves loves where

777
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:14,819
we're at and then we also did some

778
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:16,290
forbidden fruit we've done golden lemons

779
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:19,679
and we're doing some more blueberry

780
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:22,700
cookies and it's gonna be paired with

781
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,900
with three different courses and

782
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,390
ultimately it just gives people the

783
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,269
chance to kind of delve into the terpene

784
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:32,400
side of cannabis because amazingly they

785
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:34,589
paired Jamie paired arose a with our

786
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,470
blueberry cookies and you know you do

787
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:41,009
the side by side you know comparison and

788
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:43,920
the bouquet the scent was so similar it

789
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:45,660
was really interesting I was actually

790
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,060
quite surprised that it was really some

791
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:50,040
it was really similar so that is really

792
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,909
fun and you know we're working with the

793
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,529
Humboldt seed company and

794
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:56,500
we're also working with Hendrix farms

795
00:33:53,529 --> 00:34:00,279
we're developing some we're Fino hunting

796
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:02,259
this strain called the liliquoi so we'll

797
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:04,480
be doing more of that and we also are

798
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:06,369
doing the vanilla frosting that was with

799
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,190
happy dreams farms and humboldt seed

800
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:13,960
company and yeah we've got a lot of

801
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:22,559
exciting strains oh yeah definitely we

802
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:30,190
we collaborate all the time yeah so yes

803
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:32,409
so for the live live resin yeah so the

804
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,690
humboldt herb council a really good

805
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:37,659
friend Rob Gale of mine we're doing a

806
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,519
collaboration with him this fall and he

807
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,648
hasn't chosen what strain he wants to do

808
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,210
yet but I'm really excited to work with

809
00:34:41,648 --> 00:34:44,980
him and and like I said we've been

810
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:46,720
working with peak for a long time and

811
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,340
they do an Amber it's a full spectrum an

812
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,378
amber oil so it's a little different

813
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:53,169
what did you want to get out of just the

814
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:56,289
back it's a great event for new

815
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:56,858
beginnings you know great great place to

816
00:34:56,289 --> 00:35:03,820
meet people

817
00:34:56,858 --> 00:35:08,108
mm-hmm so excuse the voice first

818
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:09,910
question was what are we excited and

819
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:15,150
then what you want to get out

820
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:18,489
yeah honestly expansion and innovation

821
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:20,650
we're in like all aspects of that so

822
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:23,199
when it comes to obviously we

823
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,690
manufacture distribute portfolio brands

824
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,879

853
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,690
of a moment to step away and have a lot

854

like gratitude for like what we get to

855

be a part of

856
00:36:49,998 --> 00:36:55,759
number of retailers here that you were

857
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:57,469
expecting like the retailer presence I'm

858
00:36:55,759 --> 00:36:59,119
so much like Oh business-wise yes

859
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:02,659
hopefully we connect with lots of

860
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,519
retailers call me um um yeah there's a

861
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:05,689
good I'm out I mean it's really big like

862
00:37:04,518 --> 00:37:07,248
the first one where you guys are the

863
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:08,598
first one like so much smaller

864
00:37:07,248 --> 00:37:10,338
it's beautiful event they did a great

865
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:11,838
job but it's a lot bigger right so they

866
00:37:10,338 --> 00:37:14,808
have a lot more rooms to get around to

867
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:17,538
um but yeah there was a ton of retailers

868
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:18,859
come through and coming through and it's

869
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:20,119
really nice to see them and then to meet

870
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:22,068
people that haven't met before as well

871
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:28,278
because it really brings both norcal

872
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:29,748
socal together yeah so first question

873
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:31,278
was what are we up to in the next year

874
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,778
well I think we're all living in dog

875
00:37:31,278 --> 00:37:35,028
years so the next year is actually like

876
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:38,378
seven years every of weed business time

877
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:42,199
so I'll give you like the next 90 days

878
00:37:38,378 --> 00:37:45,438
yeah we just added 4,800 square feet to

879
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:47,148
our distribution and post-processing

880
00:37:45,438 --> 00:37:48,528
manufacturing space and we're building

881
00:37:47,148 --> 00:37:50,358

882
00:37:48,528 --> 00:37:52,969
department to fulfill cartridges for

883
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:54,768
these guys a personal life goal of mine

884
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:56,889
is being fulfilled on Friday when I'm

885
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:59,688

cannabis Terp distillate for the Marlene

887
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:04,368
Naturals brand I spent three years of my

888
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:06,289
life with the Bob Marley legend albums

889
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:10,039
stalking my CD player so there's like a

890
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:11,239
big deal for me we're actually doing

891
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,709
we're doing manufacturing and

892
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:14,719
formulation but they're actually doing

893
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:16,338
the manufacturing and packaging and

894
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,378
compliance testing so we produce the

895
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:19,878
formulated oil and they produce a

896
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:21,228
finished good from that and then sent up

897
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:23,598
for compliance testing and distribute to

898
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:24,978
retail so me and all my guys up in

899

will be contributing the THD intervenes

901
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:30,169
needed for the Marley language which is

902
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:40,789
kind of a dream come true like I can't

903
00:38:30,168 --> 00:38:42,318

911
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:59,028
it's very exciting it is dog ears and

912
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,588
it's really exciting to see see that

913
00:38:59,028 --> 00:39:01,849
come online

914
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:03,170
awesome and what were you doing at the

915
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:04,970
show

916
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:07,548
really these are these are unbelievable

917
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:08,538
hunting opportunities the especially one

918
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:10,009
of the things the show does its

919
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:11,839
controversial but it's really worth it

920
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:13,880
from my perspective is limiting it to

921
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:15,380
only licensed industry professionals of

922
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,910
certain license types in the beginning

923
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,250
they had one day where was licensed only

924
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:21,528
and today is you know everybody

925
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:22,699
yesterday it was easy to move around and

926
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:24,048
what I would say is I've been to a lot

927
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:25,578
of conferences right to shake 10 to 20

928
00:39:24,048 --> 00:39:27,199
hands to find someone who is the type a

929
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:29,450
type of person I'm looking for of any

930
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,669
type here it was really running 50 to

931
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:32,989
100% you know we move bulk flour bulk

932
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,099
distillate cartridges and we're about to

933
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:35,750
start working on pre rolls

934
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:37,278
chances are if you work in the cannabis

935
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,018
industry I can interact with you in some

936
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:40,969
way you either have flour knead this

937
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:42,229
tool it need cards or need one of those

938
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:44,629
things where you retail some of those

939
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,980
things so the number of connections that

940
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,450
can be made per hour in here is really

941
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,469
high and I would say one of the

942
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:49,578
important things for me is I just have

943
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,048
to remember to keep moving there's so

944
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:52,490
many interesting people just like this

945
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:53,900
like we've been hanging out for 30

946
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:55,338
minutes and I haven't talked to an extra

947
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,528
nine people because of that and who

948
00:39:55,338 --> 00:40:05,960
knows it sounds like the show is doing a

949
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:07,759
better job of filtering out you could

950
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,420
say they're extracting the best out of

951
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:13,099
the industry and it was a really great

952
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,630
event it was really well produced it was

953
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:16,400
mellow the food was good

954
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,599
the spacing was fine the size of the

955
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,460
venue the number of people here was

956
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,750
really good and really just a quality

957
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,980
and caliber of people wandering around

958
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:26,960
you can absolutely have a 21 year old

959
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,028
gal smoking a joint sitting on a seat

960
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,220
next to the CEO men men I just saw that

961
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:33,108
like just a moment ago and just casually

962
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:34,669
having conversations so like the most

963
00:40:33,108 --> 00:40:37,808
extremes of everything or baeble here on

964
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,809
the professional side it's been huge

965
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:41,659
thanks for having us
