2
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:14,968
so you want to talk about brands in

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:16,618
cannabis in 2019 I feel that for not

4
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,879
coming from Koreatown collective which

5
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:23,129
is a recreational adult use cannabis

6
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:25,169
collective the brands are really out

7
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:28,410
there way too soon ahead of the curve

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,630
way spending way too much money you can

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,969
take a canned essent that has a

10
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,859
multitude of billboards now that's

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,350
competing for billboard time with Mad

12
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,960
Men and how they've tried to brand

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,230
themselves they're basically Outsiders

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,929
coming into a cannabis world the brand

15
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:48,238
itself I think will be and people will

16
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:50,969
understand the brand when we actually

17
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,500
have delivery services working and when

18
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,329
people call in telephone and want

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,090
something they want a consistency if you

20
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,489
want Heinz 57 ketchup you want Heinz 57

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,870
ketchup if you want a coke you certainly

22
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:03,058
don't want a Pepsi to show up at your

23
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:05,099
door and that was kind of where the

24
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:08,099
brand's can really get their foothold in

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,640
the taxi world start really is turning

26
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,739
into CVS you like I stock the store and

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,030
I look at price points I mean I got to

28
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,158
have something for every single person

29
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,200
because we're on Melrose the tour buses

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,180
stop right in front of our store people

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,890
get on and off the buses all day long

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,439
besides selling apparel and things like

33
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,180
that for people to go home with they

34
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,399
want a pre-roll they want to edible they

35
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,920
want different types of things back in

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,469
the day people wanted their flower and

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,368
your flower business was probably 60 to

38
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:40,260
70 percent of your business now now it's

39
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:41,879
vapes and edibles

40
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,160
and people are going crazy with it

41
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,739
you've taken away the stigmatism of

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,019
having to like smoke a joint or a blunt

43
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,890
when people can smell that odor and if

44
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:52,229
you babe

45
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,150
that odors knows to stinks you're not

46
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,070
going to get into your car and smell a

47
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,590
vape pen like you're gonna smell like I

48
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,669
was smoking to join him on a car so it's

49
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,460
a totally different thing you've taken

50
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,439
away that stigmatism the CBD source like

51
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,169
took away the hurdle of you don't have

52
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,359
to show your ID to come in and you get

53
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,740
to ask a lot of questions and then after

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,110
you're prepared you can leave the CBD

55
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,430
store and then go to the THC store and

56
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,590
get whatever medicines you want to go

57
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,409
and not feel intimidated because you

58
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,599
don't know anything can you give me some

59
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:23,430
nuanced differences like the

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,710
interactions with brands and

61
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,370
distributors representing brands today

62
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:32,010
versus a year ago or two years ago I

63
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:37,920
have to tell you this brand these brand

64
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:40,709
these brand owners distributors they're

65
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,629
horse I mean they really are they are so

66
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,270
busy trying to do anything they can to

67
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:48,180
get into koreatown collective they're

68
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,159
desperate to get there because you're

69
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,439
not a brand if you don't have any retail

70
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,900
place to deliver your brand especially

71
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,699
in cannabis space you can spend all the

72
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,500
money you want and put all the orange

73
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,109
billboards or red billboards you want

74
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,030
around town and unless you get someone

75
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,709
to come in a retail store and buy your

76
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:10,439
product it's just a money pit so it

77
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,810
seems like what I'm hearing is everybody

78
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,949
is going for market share and they will

79
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:19,319
do anything to show sales and market

80
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:20,849
share I would say that's a very good

81
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,939
point that you've just said there

82
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,469
because you take someone like you're

83
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,750
spending a lot of money you take a brand

84
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:28,409
like select they did exactly what you

85
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,360
just said

86
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,669
they put were able to put a lot of sales

87
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,160
on their books whether they're

88
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:37,139
creditable sells or not we're not to

89
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,909
judge but they were able to turn around

90
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,458
and sell themselves for nine hundred

91
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,930
million dollars last week he did a great

92
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,129
job I mean he did what he was supposed

93
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,550
to do

94
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:50,549
so kudos to Canton for that but that's

95
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:54,480
really what it is but until these brands

96
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:56,910
realized the stores are their flagship

97
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,679
places to do business they're going to

98
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:01,020
spend a lot of wills and they can spend

99
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,409
a lot of time getting people to come in

100
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:06,240
and brand ambassadors and some are cute

101
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:07,710
some are have a sense of personality

102
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,570
someone can really sell product

103
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,219
somewhere educated and unless you can

104
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:14,159
get someone to come in there and support

105
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,689
your product I can tell you I don't have

106
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,579
the time to make you a brand anymore

107
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,560
it's not like it was back in the day I

108
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,629
can remember when Kiba first walked in

109
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,269
my store and we did all our own edibles

110
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:26,279
and things like that and the Kiva girl

111
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:28,199
was just awesome and we took keep it was

112
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,949
one of our first brands that we actually

113
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,259
brought into her store that was like

114
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:36,300
2015 sort of like four years ago and

115
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,610
they're still there but they support

116
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,000
their brand and that would be the best

117
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:46,050
advice I could give a brand to do is

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,480
support your brand coming to your store

119
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,300
support it and educate the patient I

120
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,430
can't educate everyone by by myself and

121
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,389
it's going to be knowledge that's going

122
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,389
to give everyone power

123
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,749
[Music]

124
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:10,098
there are some small brands that are

125
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:13,038
doing better jobs than the bigger brands

126
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:16,728
I will tell you because we're a very big

127
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:19,938
partner of packs so in the packs fillers

128
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:22,218
have really become there like a lot of

129
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:25,729
small boutique oil companies and we've

130
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:27,738
become very close with them and as the

131
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:29,899
everything is evolved the past year

132
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:32,748
those little vapor companies have paired

133
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:35,478
with farms or whatever and I spend more

134
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:37,129
time working with the smaller farms and

135
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,188
those site business is bringing for each

136
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:42,408
other than I do like the big like brands

137
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:45,739
such as condesa and things like that the

138
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:49,639
flour is just not there some as far as

139
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:51,618
like Kaneko or who makes edibles Dixie

140
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,848
makes a great gummy I mean some of these

141
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:54,829
companies are really having to step up

142
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:57,050
their game and they're probably hiring

143
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:59,329
like real chefs to come into their

144
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,259
kitchens and cook and then you have to

145
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:04,098
just know how to work with the

146
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:05,598
distillates to make it taste right but

147
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:09,378
you know those type of brands will

148
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:11,959
really will do okay what kind of give me

149
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:14,389
the percentage of people walking in the

150
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:17,629
door who are looking for specific brands

151
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,218
versus people just saying I want all can

152
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:22,218
you recommend what you like

153
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:23,718
that's what correct on Melrose with all

154
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:25,759
the tourists and the recreational people

155
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:27,709
people walk in and like whatever we

156
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,778
recommend most people coming say they

157
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:31,399
want an edible and most of the edibles

158
00:06:29,778 --> 00:06:35,868
we have are brand names whether it's

159
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:38,028
Kaneko it's Kiva big Pete's pussy punch

160
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:40,459
so we have those name brands you see the

161
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:42,618
billboards they known the names so a lot

162
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:44,778
of times that's very very easy to do

163
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:46,369
it's the same thing with the vape but

164
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:48,918
the vape companies they had such a

165
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:50,599
problem because when 2018 came around

166
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:52,128
and all these they probably didn't know

167
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:55,188
it through the party so much of their

168
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,749
product got into the black market and it

169
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:59,028
was counterfeit and whatever so some of

170
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:01,009
those brands you now know that do the

171
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:02,778
oil companies you're not going to pick

172
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:04,459
because you don't know if it's real or

173
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:06,618
not I can tell you that if I have a

174
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:08,929
product to my store it came directly

175
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:10,969
from the manufacturer so I know it's

176
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,828
quality but there are some really great

177
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:15,610
brands that came out like ocean which is

178
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:17,379
live resin parts

179
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,569
everyone's come and stepped up their

180
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,040
game in the oil game and now if people

181
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,170
just like I almost like price wars

182
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,870
because there's such a glut of it on the

183
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,819
market are you gonna put it into part or

184
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,350
you can put it into an edible and then

185
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,659
you have your flower that took so long

186
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,310
to go through the whole chain by the

187
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,020
time it gets into a jar and into

188
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,110
patients hand it's probably was

189
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:42,159
harvested six months ago which it's not

190
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:46,569
fair so now that THC medicines now may

191
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,800
be CBN because it's degraded so how I

192
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,009
don't know how they're gonna fix all

193
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,410
those things what's on the one hand you

194
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:54,610
mentioned you know brands spending a ton

195
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,560
of money that you think they're

196
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,199
overspending but then you also said that

197
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,209
the the tourists coming and recognize

198
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,579
the brands from the works just really

199
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:04,750
from the food not these flower shops

200
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:07,029
they're not seeing that they're not

201
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,759
understanding the branding that's going

202
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:11,769
on in front on these billboards they're

203
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,810
so busy trying to make a lifestyle pose

204
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:17,049
or a picture or whatever they're not

205
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:19,269
doing anything to educate the consumer

206
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,280
and sometimes the consumer needs a

207
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:22,930
little bit of Education because nobody

208
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,909
wants to walk into a store and be so

209
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,400
intimidated you can't ask that first

210
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:29,439
question I mean I know in our store

211
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:31,989
where I'll say if I'm the one waiting on

212
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,480
the client you know what brought you

213
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,070
here what are you looking for how can I

214
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,050
help you please that everyone has a

215
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,390
story everyone has an ailment everyone

216
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:43,089
has something or they have a friend that

217
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:46,569
has a problem so and that's the whole

218
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,830
thing so for me I don't need a brand I

219
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,960
don't need a brand could come tell me

220
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,629
that and then make up some cockamamie

221
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,129
name you know but I can tell you that

222
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:56,679
the market shifted when you're asking

223
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:58,990
about that where eighty percent of the

224
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:01,959
people were connoisseurs in cannabis now

225
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,549
eighty percent of adult use users twenty

226
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,160
percent of us are out there they're

227
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:07,959
still no we want a specific thing to

228
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,689
smoke we want a certain terpene taste

229
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,610
we're in a certain profile that we're

230
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,040
looking for I don't know how we're ever

231
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,750
gonna get over that hump I don't know do

232
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,199
I go out and create a brand that caters

233
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,730
to that twenty percent I'll let it take

234
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,220
off because I know that if people know

235
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,200
that Janice put her name on it that it

236
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,850
can go in a box and we can sell it and

237
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,800
it'll be what you want because I

238
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,720
wouldn't have done it

239
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,849
do it right sorry just to clarify the

240
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,100
20% we're talking about the highly

241
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:38,040
educated people it's now 20 percent of

242
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,600
highly educated and 80% have they don't

243
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,419
know and you know the whole markets

244
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,899
change where was an 80% was a medical

245
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:47,399
user 20% was a recreational user you

246
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,759
know now the whole market is like

247
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,948
flip-flopped so now I cater to the adult

248
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,139
your shoes are we sell tons of pre-rolls

249
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:58,289
people come in you know whether it's an

250
00:09:55,139 --> 00:10:01,339
ocean pre-roll or Coast pre-roll or kid

251
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:03,808
that's apparel no one cares you know and

252
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:06,720
knowing how people what they're using to

253
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:08,909
do their pre-rolls not realizing that

254
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,399
that's a great place for them to make

255
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:13,618
money that I would put my best foot in

256
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,850
my pre-roll some of these other people

257
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:16,949
that are new into the business they

258
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,298
don't they put their trim and their

259
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:20,758
trash into their pre-rolls

260
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:22,619
and that's the easiest way to get

261
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:27,058
someone to your brand it's through a

262
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:30,149
pre-roll so in any kind of retail market

263
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:33,899
I think of like beverages and coca-cola

264
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:34,740
and Pepsi kind of controlling they're

265
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,289
very powerful

266
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,259
so as companies become more powerful

267
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:43,649
they throw their weight around in not

268
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:45,449
the nicest of ways so my assumption is

269
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:47,639
this industry is going to go to a point

270
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:50,099
where you're going to have these the

271
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,298
chains of you know one it's gonna be a

272
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,769
jury I think you're trying to get to

273
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:55,499
where are they going to start paying for

274
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:58,678
shelf space in places to be in stores

275
00:10:55,499 --> 00:11:00,449
and or own their own stores and yes the

276
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:02,909
reason we have not done that yet is

277
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:05,490
because I'm more concerned about how the

278
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:07,350
IRS is going to treat that income coming

279
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,448
in because when everything going into a

280
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,119
cannabis store gets taxed differently

281
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:14,219
for the 280a than anything else and

282
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:17,220
until they can discern whether someone's

283
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,459
gonna pay me shelf spaces that rent so

284
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,649
it comes off my rent is that consulting

285
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:25,588
money to me because I have 12 years

286
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,839
experience in your doing that or it's a

287
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:30,029
discount off a product and now I don't

288
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,350
have to pay as much taxes there that's

289
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:33,149
what one another one of those things

290
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,470
that the legislators and things like

291
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,269
that they need to get strength this

292
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,350
whole tax situation because they're

293
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,289
burying us alive

294
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,180
I'm not Al Capone I'm not that's what

295
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:44,338
the 280 II was started from the night

296
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:47,759
ladies were the cocaine dealers I'm not

297
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:51,960
that why am I being treated like I'm a

298
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,819
criminal was alright so yeah I was

299
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,070
basically there are two groups that

300
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,690
could become powerful and throw their

301
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,820
weight around one is a retailer that

302
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,430
becomes the CVS or the Starbucks of

303
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,709
cannabis another one is a brand that

304
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:08,969
becomes a big dominant brand which maybe

305
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:12,419
wants to they want to extend payments

306
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,820
like that brand can change try to do

307
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:17,069
whatever let's do the brand has no legs

308
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,278
unless they have a relationship to

309
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,330
retail and they can get over it you can

310
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:23,250
tell me how they're going to get over

311
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:29,940
that hump when they figure it out please

312
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:33,539
make sure that I know to be successful

313
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,730
yes they need me I do not need them and

314
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:37,379
they really have to and I don't hate

315
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,830
being like that because I really like to

316
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:43,200
be the humble person but they those

317
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,089
brands need the retailers and by the

318
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,770
state not issuing the licenses going

319
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:48,570
back full circle all the way and by the

320
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,850
states on issuing those licenses and

321
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,528
keeping the pre icos and the regular

322
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,560
stores and even municipalities that

323
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:58,429
voted to have licensed dispensaries and

324
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,809
now they're not only 80% of the city's

325
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:02,939
only 20% of the city's the state of

326
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:05,669
California are actually licensed to have

327
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:09,480
legal cannabis they're just shutting it

328
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:11,329
off so there's there's a lot more brands

329
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:18,289
than there are retail spaces right now

330
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:22,840
so you had mentioned shelf space between

331
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:26,849
our brands currently

332
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:30,399
is there a trend of brands now pain yes

333
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,110
where do you see that going I say going

334
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,149
in to be a big mess everything

335
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,850
California when it comes to politics and

336
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:38,829
Wilson Texas is going to be a mess yes I

337
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,170
could see a huge trend for it it's a

338
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,790
question of how someone operates a

339
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:45,879
business as to how they're going to

340
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:47,829
incorporate that into the business some

341
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,769
companies such as a kaliba wants to give

342
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:53,980
retailer support whether it's software

343
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:56,139
support consumer support put in their

344
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,870
umbrella ambassadors to run that I mean

345
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:01,299
there's other ways to do it now how that

346
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,339
it's gonna go full circle back in a

347
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,439
brand can get over it if they just own

348
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:08,529
the retail space like incandescent why

349
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,570
don't they just buy a retail store then

350
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:13,088
you have your hub and you can go out

351
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,080
from wherever else you want to go but at

352
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:19,270
least you have your orange flag

353
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:23,620
somewhere is med men a nice player in

354
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:26,289
the space does amendment doesn't bother

355
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,850
me in this space do I like their

356
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:30,579
business model and do I like the way

357
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,990
they handle things no not particularly

358
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,910
like have they sent the street teams

359
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,730
outside your shop so you try to poach

360
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:38,860
customers I don't have that but I've

361
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,360
seen them on the streets doing that and

362
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,820
I don't know that I've seen their street

363
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,589
teams out on the streets as much as you

364
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,370
know they were I think they have their

365
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:49,420
own internal problems to deal with

366
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,100
they've gotten themselves into a

367
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:53,259
quandary because you know they spent a

368
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,879
lot of money advertising whatever and

369
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,370
they took away the money probably from

370
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,649
their operating costs you know and doing

371
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:03,490
their day-to-day stuff but I think that

372
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:05,319
they've bitten off quite a bit and they

373
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,899
have a lot of shareholders to answer to

374
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,940
but like Mad Men is gonna have to answer

375
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,069
tell our shareholders so are some other

376
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,500
companies that are busy running to the

377
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:19,150
north to get this money and you know

378
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:21,850
they're investing a lot of quoting

379
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:24,009
renderings renderings of business plans

380
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,019
or renderings of structures and things

381
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:28,389
of that sort so I hope it doesn't put a

382
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:30,909
black eye on the people that have been

383
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:34,299
here for a long time but I guess we're

384
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:35,860
used to fixing whatever you know happens

385
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:38,049
and occurs

386
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,899
that's why they called us though the

387
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:43,179
pioneers right so you have all these

388
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,990
companies that are raising tons of money

389
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:48,639
to basically play a long game have you I

390
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,089
don't know if it's necessarily to play

391
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,769
the long game I think from in their mind

392
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:56,649
they're playing the long game we're

393
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:58,539
gonna build market share maybe lose this

394
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:00,578
in the world this is in the world of

395
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:01,319
social media where the long time is a

396
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:04,328
minute

397
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,910
it's all relative I guess right but you

398
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:08,528
seem more slow in study

399
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:12,610
it's just how I was brought up I mean

400
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:14,110
it's like using Canadian yeah I still

401
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:18,909
own a hundred percent of Koreatown

402
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:20,889
collective we own the CBD store we'll

403
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:22,870
franchise out some of those the others

404
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:27,399
CBD stores are coming into other cities

405
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:31,089
right now as we speak but no so in

406
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,610
addition to your own house brand because

407
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:35,800
I think a lot of the talk in the CVD

408
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,480
world is it's so crowded with all these

409
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,028
brands and I don't know which ones are

410
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,278
good which ones aren't so give me some

411
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:45,129
brands that stand out for quality in

412
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:48,100
your quality beside to elevate CBD

413
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:50,049
skincare I would say the PABA in

414
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,560
Berkeley they brought their stuff into

415
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:56,139
CBD world bloom farms made an excellent

416
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,759
tincture the antidote itself we're

417
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,559
coming with our own brands because of

418
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,169
the manufacturing being able to have

419
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,519
beauty manufacturers behind us we're

420
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:07,328
able to bring all these different things

421
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:10,150
it's the question of looking for how to

422
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:12,068
use CBD best like if you're gonna do it

423
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,169
a topically you want to make sure you're

424
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:16,928
using in a topically place where your

425
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:20,020
ports can absorb in the CBD and it's

426
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:22,959
useful to you as far as tinctures you

427
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:25,959
want to find a company that came into

428
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,449
CBD world for a reason iris are one that

429
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,700
comes up to me because it's a botanical

430
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:33,730
line of teachers that they make it was a

431
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,130
very natural move for them to come into

432
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,700
CBD world because now they're pairing

433
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,840
CBD with their natural and central oils

434
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,630
when you're dealing with your team

435
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:45,490
internally what's what's your head of

436
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,800
compliance trying to

437
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:51,019
hammer and drill and everybody's had for

438
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,740
us our biggest compliance issues are

439
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:55,759
getting our products in the door

440
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,120
everything you have to have a manifest

441
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:01,519
and invoice a tracking number and it's

442
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,369
educating our distributors to bring and

443
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,259
have properly documented products that

444
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:07,849
are coming to the stores where it's my

445
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,349
employees my employees don't have the

446
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:11,089
problem because everything's given to

447
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:12,799
them we're ready to go on the shelves

448
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:14,449
it's like going to CVS when was last

449
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,629
time you went to CVS and you were

450
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,769
standing by the aspirin section and you

451
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,920
didn't know the difference between a

452
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:23,329
leave Tylenol motrin or whatever but yet

453
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,850
you went in a cannabis store and you've

454
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:27,500
got four different edibles once two and

455
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:29,539
a half milligrams one's five milligrams

456
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,549
once in milligrams but yet the cannabis

457
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:33,740
story you have someone telling you which

458
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:35,569
one you should take and how you should

459
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,309
take it and how she should use it but

460
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:40,039
CVS did you have that same thing at the

461
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:41,690
Tonto section who's going to have a

462
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:47,389
greater success rate of getting their

463
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:55,160
client over the headache CVS or me know

464
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:56,690
me because I educated all right but all

465
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,509
right so from a compliance perspective

466
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,170
it's not really your internal team it's

467
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:04,970
more the company it's where I literally

468
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,890
it's like running a relay and you're

469
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,350
handing the baton so the baton has to go

470
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:13,040
from the person that was in the nursery

471
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:15,519
to the cultivator to the manufacturer to

472
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,519
the retailer

473
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,319
so all that had to match up my in-house

474
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:24,259
staff once they put their they have

475
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:25,509
their IDs on they scan their you know

476
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:27,529
their barcode to come in and out

477
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:29,750
everything is set up for them oh it's

478
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:31,819
just like regularly going to CVS and

479
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,440
them explaining products and you

480
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:35,149
selecting the products you want there's

481
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,250
not a compliance problem on their side

482
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:42,050
okay unless I'm missing the question

483
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:44,210
what yeah so it seems like all the

484
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:48,589
companies that come in to deliver

485
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:50,539
products some of them are totally on top

486
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:52,369
they have all their rights and some of

487
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:54,589
them had they have to go back it's just

488
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:56,569
rejected I don't teach anymore

489
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:58,939
I reject what percentage of people

490
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:03,349
coming to the door to drop product off

491
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:05,779
our get an a-plus on compliance people

492
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:09,109
now coming to me if you had asked me six

493
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:12,529
months ago I would take 10% we're

494
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:14,779
complying now everything coming to me I

495
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:16,759
bet you we've got to like 75% are

496
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:18,230
compliant now I have a lot of people

497
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,759
still new people trying to drop me

498
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,099
products or samples and things like that

499
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,750
and most of them don't even get a

500
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:26,149
conversation because it's not compliant

501
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,799
product I don't know how that's in the

502
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,350
future it's gonna end up in the track

503
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:37,460
and trade system that's not my job

504
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:41,179
thank God and what I like the top they

505
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,730
cannot match they try to do a mass batch

506
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,750
and then they break it into flavors or

507
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,240
whatever and they don't realize that

508
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:50,359
each flavor it's a distinct unit product

509
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,190
SKU so each one had to be tested to

510
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,019
comments that product SKU it's not just

511
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,570
indica sativa hybrid is the main branch

512
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,430
and they can all have the same SKU now

513
00:20:56,569 --> 00:21:00,950
if you make one flavor one grape one

514
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:03,019
green cracked one blue drink each one of

515
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,420
those subsets needs to also have asked

516
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:09,200
you are you going to be doing delivery

517
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:11,029
yes we are we're setting it up we're

518
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,710
first launching our delivery we're going

519
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:14,809
to partner with someone and it'll be

520
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,180
like top tier stuff so they can get a

521
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:18,619
lot larger amounts and then we'll roll

522
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,480
out right behind that world roll that

523
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:23,269
where you can get deliveries from k-town

524
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,309
direct and that's where your brand's

525
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:27,109
that's where your loyalty that's where

526
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:29,480
all 12 years of everything I've done in

527
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:31,250
my community will make me different than

528
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,819
everyone else because people will trust

529
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:37,099
what I put in the back also on site

530
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:39,259
consumption when they finally approve it

531
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:41,419
for us we would go next door we're next

532
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:44,329
door to hookah bar so we've already

533
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:47,029
spoken to because you know it's like

534
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:49,189
five places on one lot so we've already

535
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:52,519
spoken and because I ended up being the

536
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:54,710
mayor of my community block I just like

537
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,269
said you have this in that you know they

538
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,610
don't run the hookah lounge really in

539
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:01,129
the daytime I said you got this part I

540
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,869
got my part and shook hands and just

541
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:05,510
wait for the licenses to come out for

542
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:09,459
the city of Los Angeles which I don't

543
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:12,970
think will be anytime soon

544
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,970
20:20 know

545
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:22,718
Gregg is great and Gregg and I have a

546
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:24,819
lot of the same ideas

547
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:26,769
we both had each other's backs when the

548
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:30,278
people just kind of push those aside we

549
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:32,519
say to our own stuff he's awesome hits

550
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:35,858
awesome what he's done for the refinery

551
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,269
the micro license he really helped so

552
00:22:35,858 --> 00:22:39,428
many brands at the beginning especially

553
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:41,558
in 2018 when they needed to get brands

554
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:44,169
and they needed a place to be format for

555
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:47,378
a distribution and he took to that and

556
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:49,239
it's like right now all of us were doing

557
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:51,488
certain things that made us unique and

558
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:53,348
pioneers for all those years but every

559
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:56,499
one every one of us kind of recreating

560
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:58,450
ourselves and break down his niche I'm

561
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:59,950
sorry to say my niche went over to CBD

562
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,869
and making other things because I could

563
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,328
operate and think in that space because

564
00:23:01,868 --> 00:23:06,819
that's who I am

565
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:09,878
so we created I found a I found a void

566
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:12,788
and I I just drove a truck through there

567
00:23:09,878 --> 00:23:15,098
there's something to the idea that for

568
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:18,819
that last mile distributor really

569
00:23:15,098 --> 00:23:24,878
knowing that market really well is an

570
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:27,069
advantage I think that Gregg is really

571
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:29,348
good at what he does and he's gonna know

572
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:31,749
his products of what it is and I do

573
00:23:29,348 --> 00:23:35,319
think it makes a difference that last

574
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:37,419
mile but I think the brands have to

575
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,999
remember they're using Gregg for that

576
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:41,259
last mile distribution they still don't

577
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:43,028
kind of come back in there and support

578
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:46,509
Gregg Gregg doesn't have the time to go

579
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:47,798
make their brand in other spaces you

580
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,389
know I'm saying yes he can to get the

581
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:51,548
product there and get it there because

582
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:56,288
he has to travel with it they need to

583
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:58,628
support Gregg you know and if that Gregg

584
00:23:56,288 --> 00:24:01,269
can be more successful Gregg can be it's

585
00:23:58,628 --> 00:24:03,158
gonna make them even exponentially much

586
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:04,929
more successful so are you seeing this

587
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,519
as an overall issue which is kind of

588
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:09,459
what I'm hearing lack of support from

589
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:11,169
the distributor is why disturbia I only

590
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:13,269
take Brandt's out into my store if

591
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:15,549
they're coming in to help support but I

592
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:18,159
can't do it anymore they have me with so

593
00:24:15,548 --> 00:24:20,078
many jobs and so many hats it's just

594
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,519
hard it's hard to keep up with emails

595
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:23,648
it's hard to keep up with everything

596
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,048
I mean they've made a miserable space

597
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:28,658
they took something that I really used

598
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:29,529
to like have fun doing and I would go

599
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:31,750
through and I get

600
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:33,759
products and create it I would create

601
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,900
products I would have edibles right so

602
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,720
we were always making the chicken and

603
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,430
waffles and sauces and we are going into

604
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,620
contest we didn't even ask we were

605
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:44,529
winning just because it's what it was

606
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:47,619
and our concentrates and they've taken

607
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:50,819
that away they've cut our arms off the

608
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:53,829
politicians the government legislators

609
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:56,799
law enforcement although I have to say

610
00:24:53,829 --> 00:25:00,189
my law enforcement for me they've so

611
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,169
supportive of us we had a robbery and

612
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,390
they were like the detectives kind of

613
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:06,550
like looked left in the lead detectives

614
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,440
said no she's our girl she's our

615
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:10,480
legitimate shop and we're going and it

616
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,980
was and they were there and they checked

617
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,980
up on me every single part
