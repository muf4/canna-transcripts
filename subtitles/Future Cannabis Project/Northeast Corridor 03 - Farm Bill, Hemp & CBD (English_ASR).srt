2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:19,109
let's though let's jump into CVD because

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,250
we've really mostly talked about you

4
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:26,720
know THC version cannabis CBD obviously

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,028
is the the you know breakout star of

6
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:33,659
2018 I expect it's going to be even more

7
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:35,820
so in 2019 I'm sure everyone in this

8
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,640
room has their own CBD product that

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,679
they're selling right now and infusing

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,929
in their kitchen with a Alexa Alexa

11
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:50,009
machine what's that lent levo levo Alexa

12
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:54,179
get me a CBD product Green Wave advisors

13
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:56,009
CBD product and you know what's I'm well

14
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,320
I'm a little torn on this because of the

15
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,210
one hand I think there are some amazing

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,969
CBD products out there but on the other

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,280
hand I think that the FDA is maybe not

18
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,560
such a bad idea to have some oversight

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,710
in this because we saw that with

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,060
vitamins that we were taking vitamins so

21
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,368
we had no idea what was in these

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,100
vitamins and they stepped in and went

23
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:18,840
that's gonna stop and we're gonna make

24
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:22,559
sure that if you get a vitamin C it's a

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,079
vitamin C and they did that test in 2017

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,240
over a bunch of CBD products and half of

27
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,670
them half of them a third of them didn't

28
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,669
even have CBD in them several of them

29
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,070
had less CBD than they claim to have and

30
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,750
then you even had companies like

31
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:39,239
Charlotte's Web the Stanley Brothers at

32
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,650
that time claiming that their CV he was

33
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,719
gonna cure cancer and everything under

34
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,040
the Sun and they got in trouble for that

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,368
and they had to take all that language

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,090
down where do you guys see CBD going at

37
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:50,700
this point

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,390
well it's huge the markets huge receive

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,909
it's growing big big but well with a

40
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,090
hemp farm bill passing yeah for sure

41
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,920
but I think there's a lot of

42
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,049
misperception out there in terms of

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,060
really what this all means because at

44
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,719
the end of the day the FDA has to

45
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,030
approve these products and they have to

46
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,479
attest to you know the labeling in the

47
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,239
package

48
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,829
and all that so I don't know it's still

49
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,878
a lot of unknowns yet how this is all

50
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,530
gonna play out where we see it is really

51
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,419
on the hem side so we've been tracking

52
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,669
hemp licenses and trying to get our arms

53
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,439
around that market and it's been it's

54
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:30,929
been challenging what we've learned is

55
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,848
that the way a lot of these industrial

56
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,849
programs have come about is it's really

57
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:37,798
about farming and as we've reached out

58
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:40,259
to a lot of these people it's so and

59
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:42,090
so's farm in you know upstate New York

60
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,068
and it's very much

61
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,500
agricultural so there's less information

62
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:48,268
about them but you know different states

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,259
regularly differently like Colorado and

64
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:54,030
Oregon have many many licenses and and

65
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:55,709
their test programs are really fully

66
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,609
commercial now we're people who do all

67
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,590
sorts of stuff with the the hemp

68
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:04,950
including making CBD products in other

69
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,959
places it's much more agricultural

70
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,149
commodity pricing we've got seeds we're

71
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,009
gonna dÃ©cor decayed stocks a word that I

72
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,060
never knew until last year where you

73
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:14,548
sort of ripped them apart and make

74
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,239
things with them so so we see it more

75
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:19,919
with as an industrial agricultural

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,549
product and we're curious to see what

77
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:26,130
the regulations are in terms of

78
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:28,680
Licensing for retail if it ever comes to

79
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,180
that so I had heard that what the

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,650
government shut down that was a big

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,719
issue for the hemp farmers because

82
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,340
apparently if you apply for a license

83
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,799
you have to have an FBI background check

84
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,450
or something of that sort yet have some

85
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,400
kind of background check that right now

86
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:42,899
because the government shut down they

87
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,719
can't get those background checks so

88
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,879
they can't get their approval to start

89
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,400
their farms interestingly Kentucky has

90
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:54,359
quite a robust hemp program so I wonder

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,980
if that'll push I mean obviously Mitch

92
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,569
McConnell supported the farm bill and

93
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,429
pushed it through because the Kentucky

94
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,858
farmers they were losing their tobacco

95
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,989
fields because people weren't smoking as

96
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:06,329
many cigarettes and that was going to be

97
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,030
their saving grace was to switch over to

98
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:12,449
hemp which actually was their original

99
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,699
crop before tobacco so I think the other

100
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:18,840
thing we may start to see in the coming

101
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:20,819
years is is FDA enforcement against like

102
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,069
the bad actors of CBD because

103
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:26,110
technically the FDA has regulatory

104
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:28,538
approval over CBD now and so the

105
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,360
you know folks online who are selling

106
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:33,848
CBD products I'm especially you know

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,530
tainted CBD products products making

108
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:38,259
false claims about health benefits

109
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:41,019
that's that's low-hanging fruit for the

110
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:43,419
FDA to go after them as an enforcement

111
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:45,639
mechanism for making those false health

112
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:47,529
claims for selling products that haven't

113
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,449
been approved by the seat by the FDA

114
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:52,779
going through the clinical trials

115
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:55,860
process so a you know CBD is it's huge

116
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:58,929
like like the the CBD market seems to be

117
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:02,919
outpacing cannabis tremendously but

118
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:05,288
because the FDA has approved CBD as a

119
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,908
regulated product I would expect to see

120
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:10,538
enforcement from them against some of

121
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:13,329
these online actors if they were getting

122
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:16,509
paid if they were getting paid and open

123
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:18,788
for business because I think that it's

124
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:21,310
gonna it's there's there's already so

125
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:26,800
many CBD products it's gonna be really

126
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:28,300
difficult for the FDA to get their arms

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,978
around this I mean sure they can go

128
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,348
after the big players though like you

129
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:37,508
said like the people that are online

130
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:40,689
that are you know established most yeah

131
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:43,150
but you know even here in the New York

132
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:45,550
area there are numerous CBD companies

133
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:47,799
that like I said the people just you

134
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,528
know cooking up some lotion in their

135
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,199
kitchen and now it's the CBD well but

136
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:56,468
you can do that it's literally all you

137
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,389
have to do is go not oil some CBD do it

138
00:05:56,468 --> 00:06:00,158
an infuser get a nice package put a

139
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:02,800
label on it and you're in business but

140
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:05,168
that's what happened in California you

141
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,598
know CBD products were in whole food CBD

142
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:10,000
products were in like the grocery store

143
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,860
and then public and everyone was just

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,079
like oh this is legal because everyone

145
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,389
is doing it but then Public Health came

146
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,189
out and said none of y'all are illegal

147
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:19,658
and we're gonna start enforcing against

148
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:22,120
you we're gonna do an education campaign

149
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:25,300
first but if you don't get in line with

150
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,620
it you know we're going to enforce it's

151
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
one of those things that you know just

152
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,978
because everybody's doing it does it

153
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,990
doesn't mean it's it's legal and the

154
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:34,838
government doesn't have teeth to go

155
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,418
after the FDA has regulatory authority

156
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:38,829
to go after CBD and most states have

157
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:41,259
regulatory authority

158
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:42,550
as well do you guys think that the hemp

159
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:47,110
markets gonna be bigger than the

160
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:51,639
cannabis THC market yes absolutely

161
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:53,590
and and why and and how how so well if

162
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,490
you think about hemp right so hemp in

163
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:57,159
and of itself

164
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:02,040
there's industrial hemp so soap rope

165
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:06,730
whatever you derive from that concrete

166
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:08,740
everything's him so it with with the

167
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,950
farm bill there there's the pathway for

168
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,620
you know big health and wellness

169
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:17,050
products the supplement industry to get

170
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,079
into the hemp market there's no federal

171
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,850
prohibition that's keeping the rest of

172
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,269
the bigs away like there are in cannabis

173
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,890
and and you know hemp being sold at CBD

174
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:30,639
products being sold at the grocery store

175
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:32,439
it's much more approachable for regular

176
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,750
folks who have never touched a cannabis

177
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,879
product before it's the these hemp

178
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:40,089
products don't have the same stigma as

179
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,699
cannabis and they're they're just going

180
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:44,799
to outpace it just by availability

181
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,329
number of outlets where you can purchase

182
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,329
it and you don't have these crazy

183
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:52,149
cannabis taxes attached to it and hemp

184
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:55,180
oil is very high in protein so if you're

185
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:58,539
vegan or vegetarian and you need high

186
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,879
protein in your diet a lot of people are

187
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,689
now turning to hemp oil in their cooking

188
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,939
or hemp oil that they're adding to their

189
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:08,410
meals to get the protein that they need

190
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:10,420
that normally they would have gotten

191
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,939
maybe from you know beans or something

192
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:16,300
like that so it's definitely become very

193
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:18,339
popular as a very very high protein type

194
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,670
of product well one other thing too is

195
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:25,029
like how do you define the CBD market so

196
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:27,670
if you put CBD in coca-cola is all

197
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:29,979
coca-cola products now consider the CBD

198
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,300
product are you double counting so I

199
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,009
think you know there's a lot of

200
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,629
uncertainty really have this it's funny

201
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:38,409
you bring up coca-cola because someone

202
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:41,500
had told me that coca-cola had that's

203
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:43,209
been why document all the CBD now South

204
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,240
America and they were like but you'll

205
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,790
never get anyone

206
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,889
firm the story and I thought it was an

207
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:50,629
amazing I I think that's been yeah

208
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:52,970
widely speculated that they were going

209
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:54,950
to enter and and all the soft drink

210
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,769
companies Gator everybody's gonna and

211
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,140
big makeup companies to here are doing

212
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:03,949
the same thing a lot of folks seem to be

213
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:08,460
stockpiling CBD or letter four-legged

214
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:17,399
friends to pet pet products

215
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:17,399
