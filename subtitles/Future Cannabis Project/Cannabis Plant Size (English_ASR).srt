2
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,829
so you so big isn't always better

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,839
I mean you've grown hella leaf your own

4
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,268
house talk your own how you know like

5
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,730
these large clothes like indoor cannabis

6
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:28,829
it's really a no and I don't bring this

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,309
up very often but when I do I'm really

8
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:34,349
I'm serious about this you know smaller

9
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:36,239
plants produce a higher quality can it

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,609
moves up and it's like because you're

11
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,738
not spending all that time growing all

12
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,960
that biomass like so when people think

13
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:45,030
endure of coffee right

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,939
most indoors grown smaller polymers

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,969
right smaller plants so you so most of

16
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:53,729
that intensity is happening you know

17
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:59,308
it's bypassing these dry it leaves and

18
00:00:53,729 --> 00:01:05,039
this huge stock like it's all like super

19
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:07,709
premium like yep different approaches

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,780
but but but so so it's you know plant

21
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,728
later you know playing a little bit

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,280
later you know it's like the you know

23
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:17,188
even more of them buy it later it's it's

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,420
a it's a responsible agriculture so I

25
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:20,399
mean it's like there are different

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,868
methods right now that we're not now

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,670
that we're not chained apply it count

28
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:28,290
you know we have a whole new world and

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,840
that's the thing too it's a commercial

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,090
weed will be a thing you know they're

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,070
there is gonna be a market for you know

32
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,630
bubblegum like artificial like

33
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,158
strawberry shortcake flavoured

34
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:42,298
distillate people are gonna get through

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,729
yeah the behringer bikes in of and I

36
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,560
mean you know until I'm the shrinks you

37
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,450
know the Mad Dog 2020 yeah I mean that's

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,969
gonna happen it's gonna be there but the

39
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,100
thing is I think yeah I get excite

40
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:53,478
people

41
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:55,368
doing this all their life it's like you

42
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,500
were already have been operating at the

43
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:58,728
top 5% of herb in the nation yeah you

44
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,739
know if you figured this out I'm gonna

45
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:02,810
take pride in it it's like yeah as long

46
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:04,879
as you just don't like compromise your

47
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,439
integrity in your morals and in and you

48
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,060
represent the plan to the highest still

49
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,068
its purpose and integrity it's gonna

50
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,170
come over back on you like tenfold and

51
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:14,629
success you know wallet so many people

52
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:16,000
in this like race to the gold rush you

53
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,169
know are gonna be just like race

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,909
imploding the people are just gonna be

55
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:21,229
like land mining themselves because they

56
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,818
you know they don't know how to take

57
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:24,709
care of this plan all the intricacies of

58
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:26,089
the supply chain management stuff of

59
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,620
that are gonna get you in trouble with

60
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,780
like things like pesticides or things

61
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:34,640
like you know and so so yeah I think

62
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:37,489
things like lying lying isn't good for

63
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,649
growing yeah it's a like don't don't lie

64
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:42,259
to me man tell me the truth like you've

65
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:46,760
never done this before yeah you're lying

66
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:48,679
- you're lying to your people your lie

67
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:51,079
to anybody I think it's not gonna work

68
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,629
out it just doesn't work out like tell

69
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,680
me you can't do it don't tell me you can

70
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:59,389
and then don't that's that's the other

71
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,069
big thing you know it's like because a

72
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:02,599
lot of these guys are telling these

73
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:05,180
other guys that they can do shit that

74
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,939
they can you know like oh yeah I can run

75
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,060
a 10,000 square foot greenhouse we go

76
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:13,099
bro and that's yeah you back you and you

77
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,569
and you and that's going on ten hundred

78
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,949
times bigger than you ever grown he's

79
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,479
like do you know how to do that without

80
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:19,129
using pesticides we're gonna take every

81
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,629
clone and methodically and preventively

82
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:22,159
treat it with organic things from the

83
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:23,780
time it's like or are you gonna get some

84
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,590
fucking infestation that's gonna wipe

85
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,239
you should oh yeah so last question so

86
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,310
when do you actually plant like when

87
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,049
because like are your plants kind of

88
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,620
that size or this size are somewhere in

89
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:37,569
between the zoo

90
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,680
like when you're working when I'm

91
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:39,759
harvesting probably somewhere around

92
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,329
that size okay

93
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,468
- the pot you know maybe you know maybe

94
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:46,510
a little bit smaller

95
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:48,400
I liked my stuff be around head height

96
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:50,199
you know about head high

97
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,489
I mean last year it got a little big I

98
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,469
had stuff that was like around 12 feet

99
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:55,539
and I just was that because you planted

100
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:59,169
it earlier no it's just because my soil

101
00:03:55,539 --> 00:04:02,469
just so good just just dominating it's

102
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:04,539
just charged is like okay so but when do

103
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:08,378
you plan how doors um you know I usually

104
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:13,000
plant you know my seeds like May 15th in

105
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:14,590
my clones June 15 so and when do you see

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,199
other people like what's the typical

107
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,970
outdoor person up north doing I mean you

108
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,519
know you have you have some people that

109
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,650
wrap their tomato cages and Christmas

110
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,930
lights and plant March yeah you know

111
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:27,758
heavily mulch and plant in March and

112
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,949
just like Christmas light them all or

113
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,400
and still dome greenhouse them with a

114
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,090
little you know utility light in there

115
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,149
you know in March

116
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:38,469
I'd say May for seed June for clone is

117
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:40,810
about average because it goes to the

118
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,750
photo circle you don't want to tweak

119
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,478
those clones out seeds don't usually pop

120
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,550
into flower as easy as clones to put a

121
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,469
clone out June first you know you know

122
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,598
and it's a it's an indica variety or you

123
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,050
stand a chance of throwing it into

124
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:55,810
flower

125
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,460
sativas less often because though they

126
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,709
go a lot longer than the season able to

127
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:02,049
much longer bench time but you know so

128
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:05,859
it really depends on the strain and what

129
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,478
farm you know but those are too good but

130
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:12,288
it's interest one of the things from you

131
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:16,500
is you're a person I don't go

132
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:18,509
200 plant pound plants I you're almost

133
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,259
doing like something that you've seen

134
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:24,930
indoors showing success in but doing it

135
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,280
possibly even better outdoors which gets

136
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,769
to sort of market perception of Oh

137
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,019
indoors there well maybe outdoor done

138
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:34,198
this way oh man we're gonna see herb

139
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:36,448
grown like green house like you know

140
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,240
that some of the dev green house you see

141
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:41,370
these days is like it's markedly higher

142
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,509
quality than indoor click and it's

143
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,259
amazing because it's like most people

144
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:48,270
have never seen that quality of you know

145
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:49,848
that's why sure the full terms I'm doing

146
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:52,079
like my full term they do really small

147
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:55,589
doing I'm sure that make something good

148
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,728
yeah yeah it does it's like oh I guess

149
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,138
ed my wife thinks I'm stupid because

150
00:05:56,728 --> 00:06:00,508
she's like she's always had like these

151
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,300
huge monsters but I'd like to keep them

152
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:05,520
small it just it just it's they're more

153
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,879
manageable but less susceptible to all

154
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,189
those weird diseases you know and from

155
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,370
what the public values which is pretty

156
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:16,019
looking flower yeah right gorgeous I

157
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,840
mean that's one obtain the development

158
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,668
on

159
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:21,189
you know you know Kaling's azure

160
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:29,799
trichomes like they're just hand over

161
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:41,259
hand over fist and you know leaps and

162
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:42,910
bounds yeah yeah I'm happy I'm happy

163
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:59,978
don't get the weight that everyone else

164
00:06:42,910 --> 00:07:02,889
does whatever expression the way he's

165
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:04,569
doing that versus the giant oh yeah well

166
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,579
no I mean I mean as far as like also you

167
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:08,019
know that what you're doing in just in

168
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:10,930
general from testing sound but it helps

169
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:12,759
a lot more with you know consistency

170
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,620
from like you're like you're like

171
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,209
standardization you know cuz it's like

172
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,668
if you have a huge plant that's never

173
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:20,560
pruned you know you you know and you

174
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:22,389
test test a bud that's in the lower

175
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,610
middle whatever and then a certain bud

176
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,829
that's up top with tons of light you

177
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,840
know you can see a massive fluctuation

178
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:30,759
you know maybe five seven percent

179
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,069
cannabinoids what have you it isn't that

180
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,288
and so you know but when you see plants

181
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,959
are you know that are pruned better and

182
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:40,389
kind of you know like you know sun

183
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:42,159
exposure is distributed a lot more

184
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,288
evenly throughout the plant you know

185
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,750
they're grown you know in smaller ways

186
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:49,569
and prune more properly yeah you see

187
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,430
like you see the the fluctuation all of

188
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,019
a sudden kind of really narrow it right

189
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,240
so the standard deviation of one bud to

190
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:57,069
the next Ike might only very like you

191
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,228
know within like you know five ten

192
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:00,459
percent of its out forever side so so

193
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,338
it's like if it was like eighteen

194
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:05,918
percent in my test you know

195
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:08,009
sixteen or or like 17 or 19 you know but

196
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,508
like you see a lot more homogeneity

197
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:13,919
created from you know consistency or

198
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,919
standardization I guess from buddy bud

199
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:30,688
