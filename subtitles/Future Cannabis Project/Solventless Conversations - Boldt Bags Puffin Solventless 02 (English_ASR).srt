[Music]

2
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:13,019
let's start with you as a hash maker so

3
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:15,298
how long have you been because you made

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,550
were you making hash first and then you

5
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:22,170
started the company yeah it started by

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:25,469
making hash necessity and where were you

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:29,460
living I was up north and my mom had

8
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:31,739
cancer and I had five sisters who

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,600
happened to know how to sew and they

10
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,429
help me sew a bag together because my

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,219
other bags were either they would get

12
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:42,269
confiscated coming from Canada happens

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,129
several times yeah it was a fun bill do

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,480
they even know that loss is a felony

15
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:52,079
back shit making hash was a bad thing

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,390
like five 10 second and I sort of can't

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,219
get over how it's come around full scale

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:02,120
now you know there's big factories

19
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:05,930
making hash with tables of people all

20
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:10,798
pushing that butter and massive scale

21
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:12,450
yes holy cow for these new states that

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,159
are getting legal we're getting calls

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,109
from Oklahoma now and they've got these

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,359
Oklahoma's blowing cash factories

25
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:22,579
they're Boston Chicago is going off the

26
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,170
hook right now

27
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:27,959
well Oklahoma is amazing because they're

28
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,310
like anybody that wants the cannabis

29
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,500
game go for it

30
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,780
no they straight said it was $2,500 for

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,219
a license and then after the first year

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,680
if you don't live here you can't get one

33
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,328
so you have to have residency so they

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,939
like they let basically you know free

35
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,319
for all for everybody and then after

36
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:48,029
that then it was like nope only if you

37
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:49,978
live here so my house or no yeah we're

38
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,118
setting up labs they're helping people

39
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:56,299
set labs up they're like every week we

40
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,040
get a new call from from a new company

41
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:01,560
and now it's big it's big management

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,700
companies that are involved it's a

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,200
different market salt corporate now

44
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,699
that's what I don't like it's like

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,920
corporation shouldn't be doing this and

46
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,329
if they are they should have people that

47
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,219
have been doing this for a long time at

48
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,680
least as some sort of consulting

49
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,539
or allowing us to like join that

50
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,980
workforce allowing us to pay our taxes

51
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,509
allowing us to have a real legitimate

52
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:23,489
job we're working our asses off like

53
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:26,370
we're not sitting around like we're not

54
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,110
like we dealers selling 20 bucks like

55
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,050
we're not that we want to we want to

56
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,040
help people provide a service like

57
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,840

58
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,870
some guy that makes really good beer in

59

63

85
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,280
them make the best hash what and what

86
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,609
was the market very late like 20 years

87
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,000
ago

88
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:48,060
it was always explosive hash has made a

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,169
couple ups and downs and it's honest

90
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,090
peak again right now but every like

91
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:57,509
eight years it goes up and down and

92
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,799
popularity and different kinds yeah in

93
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:01,079
different kinds the shatter was

94
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,420
explosive for five minutes and then it

95
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,310
like dwindled out and now it's like more

96
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,159
of a back east thing you see a lot of

97
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,870
the shatter still available out there

98
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,509
and then now everybody's turning it to

99
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,670
butter and it's like wait when I used to

100
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:16,589
make hash if your hashed if you if your

101
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:17,009
BHO turn to butter it wasn't worth

102
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,108
anything

103
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:20,699

106
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,779
vaporizer thing just smoked hash it's

107
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,719
pure

108
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:33,639

114
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,870
I mean ingesting marijuana is very

115
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,000
different than smoking marijuana if done

116
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:58,540
right with proper legend and proper

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:01,209
mixing medicine the most important thing

118
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,060
is is I have friends that need this

119
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:05,529
medicine correct and they rely on it

120
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,589
they're there they're in chemotherapy

121
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:11,500
right now and without these things their

122
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:15,219
life is miserable miserable they're

123
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:19,000
spinning out of control on chemo madness

124
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:21,669
rollercoaster throwing up and I'm so I

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,589
feel so bad for my friends but they they

126
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:26,079
need this product and it's really um

127
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:29,289
it's a good thing that we can help

128
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:32,800
people make this product with our bags

129
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:36,490
and help people we help people we teach

130
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,259
them how to make it and we're always

131
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:42,780
trying to develop the best product

132
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,779
possible and I love where it's going I

133
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:50,139
really like to the more people having

134
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,770
backyard groves doing little washes

135
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:57,759
making their own dot that's the way it

136
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:59,500
should be just like people should be

137
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,019
growing a little bit of vegetables in

138
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,990
their backyard they should be having

139
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:07,089
some tomatoes and maybe a chicken coop

140
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,350
and if you don't have the room for all

141
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:09,639
of them you and your neighbor trade off

142
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,260
and you know what I mean like those

143
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,209
little sustainable things would go a

144
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:14,829
long way with the environment and it

145
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:18,279
seems like everything wants to go big

146
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:19,839
corporate big money big lot like

147
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,299
overboard it's like it doesn't need to

148
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,239
be that way especially with cannabis it

149
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,930
doesn't need to turn into a corporate

150
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,000
mongering and in a cash grab and a well

151
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,829
Walgreens started out with cannabis and

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,449
they're finally coming back to it which

153
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:39,339

154
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:43,000

a company called smart B they make that

167
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,470
yeah the controllers yeah the indoor

168
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,670
controllers they just went to Israel and

169
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,900
did a whole bunch of stuff they were

170
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,189
there for like two weeks and some of the

171
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,379
videos that they were sending me I was

172
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:31,449
like that's an Israel like that's crazy

173
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,040
that's it looks more sophisticated than

174
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,469
what's going on here and I was just

175
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,350
blown away that they even had any type

176
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,240
of weed market let alone these insane

177
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,100
industrial labs going on like there was

178
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,900
literally like a girl in a lab coat I'm

179
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,820
like what the hell are you guys doing

180
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:47,859
out there so it was really cool to see

181
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,969
that I'm glad it's expanding it should

182
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,910
expand throughout the world there

183
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,650
shouldn't be people persecuted for this

184
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,439
plant it's ridiculous it's absolutely

185
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:59,199
ridiculous it helps so many more people

186
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,120
than it hurts there's no question

187
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,680
there's agreement all around on that top

188
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,139
you should have a toast you guys let's

189
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,410
have a toast you know cheers man here's

190
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:12,610
to the future - bring it around bring it

191
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,810
around you gotta try this the Mac one

192
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,120
though I'm telling you it's just it's

193
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:19,720
utter gasoline

194
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:24,759
alright so staying on focused top they

195
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:27,280
on focus went so you you so you're up

196
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,810
and humbled making hash and you decided

197
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,479
you wanted to make your own bags and you

198
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,429
had sisters who yeah we had another with

199
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,920
another brand called trash bags on the

200
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,779
very beat this is back in the 90s they

201
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,789
were called trash bags and you turn your

202
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,039
trash to cash and those were

203
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,929
industrial-strength bags those are a

204
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,539
really strong heavy-duty

205
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:50,309
big huge 32 gallons you'd be pulling a

206
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:53,519
big grapefruit sized softball size

207
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:56,879
beautiful chunks out of their big oil

208
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,009
balls at the ends of the bottom and they

209
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,740
were just amazing and everyone loved the

210
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:03,450
bags and they just were you guys drying

211
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,850
it that long ago what was your technique

212
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,200
we would make patties we make these cow

213
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:16,320
patties and we just put them out in the

214
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:18,030
Sun and we just now freeze dryers are

215
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,100
the way to roll of course I mean the

216
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,529
four freeze dryers I was washing I had

217
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,899
my washing machine you know and my

218
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:27,269
technique was you know the pizza box

219
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,649
technique but I had a friend that was

220
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:30,269
like dude try printer paper and I'm like

221
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:32,069
what do you talk me is like just layout

222
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,079
printer paper and put the hash on the

223
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,129
printer paper and I'm like okay you come

224
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,530
back the next day and the printer paper

225
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:40,139
is soaked all the water out of the hash

226
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:42,089
and it's all like warbly and like well

227
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:45,000
and the and the hash is like dry and I

228
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,680
wanna try those see I feel like you the

229
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,350
faster you're drying your hash the less

230
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,149
time you have for oxidization so and

231
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,040
always keep it in the dark and it was

232
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:54,480
coming out bomb back then I mean we

233
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,789
could pack it down you know roll it like

234
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,230
weed all the French guys and you're up

235
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:00,029
you know rolling it with the cellophane

236
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,259
with a hot water bottle and shit and I

237
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:03,689
was like man this is crazy

238
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:06,299
we have a tray liner we make now I know

239
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,680
I said you just come out with yeah if

240
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:11,250
you go on our website you can see them

241
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,629
and they fit in the freeze dryers but

242
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,210
it's a really good just stop up the

243
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:17,309
water and it saves time also that's

244
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,139
another development and I heard even

245
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:20,909
just freezing it and then micro planing

246
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,649
it and that's something I didn't know

247
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:25,889
about until recent getting into this

248
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:27,899
after I don't even sorry man I'm like

249
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:30,750
just as I get you focus and you start

250
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,269
talking after after a you to a tripod

251
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,909
proper tripod one day it seems like as

252
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:38,399
I've gotten into this I go way overboard

253
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:40,529
with my research and looking up stupid

254
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,139
stuff and trolling people and not

255
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:45,329
patrolling people like just I guess just

256
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:48,960
following sake stalking people you know

257
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,490
they mean and yeah I'm not talking shit

258
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,720
but I'm I'm just following any

259
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,120
information that I can find it's just

260
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,009
like the the amount of techniques that

261
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,110
are out there I just I didn't know and

262
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:59,429
and I thought I knew it all you know

263
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,169
what I mean and it seems like people are

264
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:03,208
doing so many different things and it's

265
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:03,698
so cool that we have the internet we

266
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,938
have in

267
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:09,698
we have the kind of social acceptance

268
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:11,139
that's slowly seeping out and you know

269
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:12,639
more and more people are doing this so

270
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:13,899
people are just like just let them do

271
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,259
their thing and leave them alone they're

272
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:18,428
not hurting nobody you know kind of and

273
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,678
the techniques like I said the micro

274
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,909
point in the freezing it you just tell

275
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:23,198
them you set it out in the Sun I'm like

276
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:25,558
that's the coolest we used to give

277
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:28,599
directions in the very very beginning

278
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:30,938
and we put instructions in the bags and

279
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,869
it would say lavender making so we'd say

280
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:37,988
how to make lavender and extractions and

281
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:40,059
we just do you know explain how to do it

282
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,980
or we'd say exactly what not to do do

283
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:44,318
not do this do not do that do not do it

284
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:50,259
or the lavender essence making the fans

285
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:52,838
out is for you dedicating about lavender

286
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:55,298
essence making we might switch it up to

287
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,449
eucalyptus next week but I love how I

288
00:11:55,298 --> 00:12:01,208
love how legalization has helped us

289
00:11:57,448 --> 00:12:03,578
expand and really develop new technology

290
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:06,159
it's helped us take things forward to

291
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:08,528
maximum level I mean we're like up here

292
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,058
now we're like miles ahead yeah when I

293
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:12,458
just turned like Oh hair straighteners

294
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:14,198
squishing stuff oh that's crazy that's

295
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:16,719
crazy that's not gonna happen you can't

296
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:17,889
just squeeze oil out and clean like

297
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,369
that's the craziest thing I've ever

298
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:20,288
heard

299
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:24,278
and then I'm like oh now I'm squeezing

300
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:25,808
really expensive bubble hash and it's

301
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,889
it's did the first time you're doing it

302
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:28,058
it's nerve-wracking you don't know if

303
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,829
you're gonna lose money if you're gonna

304
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:32,288
you know like you're gonna ruin

305
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:33,909
somebody's crop you're gonna you know

306
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:37,448
it's like so nerve-wracking you're like

307
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:40,808
oh my god like this is there's a lot of

308
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:42,729
emotion yeah oh man there's and there's

309
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:44,499
everybody just told me just get your

310
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,028
hands dirty get out there and figure it

311
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:48,069
out you just know I can tell you a

312
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:49,600
million things I can tell you well isn't

313
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:51,698
that like when people first started

314
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:58,899
dropping this in the water other people

315
00:12:51,698 --> 00:13:00,849
were like I went in 2004 and he dumped

316
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:02,859
it in the bucket and everybody lost

317
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,589
their mind and it was anyway two of us

318
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:07,899
the bubble man actual bubble bags that

319
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:09,669
you know he's like a goofy look from I

320
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:11,558
think he's from huzi from Humboldt or

321
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:13,239
something nice Canadian is he Canadian

322
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:14,588
are you serious oh well I didn't even

323
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:17,410
know but you know that they're really

324
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:18,879
nice the the velvet yellow bag with

325
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:21,189
a little shoulder strap he walked in

326
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,139
with that and nobody had seen it yet and

327
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,899
he did it right there in the warehouse

328
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:28,149
right at the like right across the

329
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:30,100
street from the milk leg and this is

330
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:32,169
like in 2004 and I'm like there's no way

331
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,839
that I was gonna make DNA was there for

332
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:36,519
the first year they were kids man I was

333
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,029
a kid I was like 21

334
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:42,698
well Mila just told me that when she was

335
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:44,559
first selling her bags like they were

336
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,599
you know she had a booth at some event

337
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,789
and they were all hanging like with you

338
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,009
know clothesline clips and people would

339
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:54,129
just kind of walk by and be like okay

340
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:58,329
like what the hell selling ice bags and

341
00:13:54,129 --> 00:14:01,870
then I think what was it soma soma seed

342
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:03,758
stole man I started giving him some love

343
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,350
and people were like what what do they

344
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,480
do and he's like this is what you do

345
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:11,259
with them and they were like but it's

346
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,778
been for 2,000 years in China I mean if

347
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:19,149
you do the research it's been around

348
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:21,159
1,000 days they have these times they're

349
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,809
saying like make yourself a genius they

350
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:25,958
used to eat it they would say have

351
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:27,399
genius days indeed hashish and they used

352
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:29,948
to have hash pills that they would take

353
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:38,350
back in the Egyptian times the Pharaohs

354
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:40,508
loved hash so it's but wait but but I've

355
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:44,230
always heard that like nobody thought of

356
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:45,879
adding water until like 20-30 years ago

357
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,120
it's been they've been doing it you know

358
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:52,120
there's definitely been and and when I

359
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,970
found out like BHO was made like 50

360
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,480
years ago like some of the first BHO was

361
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,560
early 70s I'm like what like why didn't

362
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,839
we know about it I remember growing up

363
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,828
and eat her like honey oil or something

364
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,630
and it kind of smelled like patchouli

365
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:06,429
oil or something you were smoking it

366
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,929
wasn't it was even good like maple syrup

367
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:10,028
or something you were smoking I didn't

368
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:13,269
know what the hell is smoking in this 18

369
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:15,220
but I just I'm just so glad it's it's

370
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,539
progressed so far to this and obviously

371
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,540
it's healthier there's no there's no

372
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:21,039
question so what are some of the like

373
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:24,188
innovations that you're both seeing now

374
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:26,649
like over the past year or two or the

375
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:28,539
majors like does anyone post yourself on

376
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:30,578
instagram whether it's a consistency or

377
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:31,088
device or a product that helps make it

378
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:33,248
that

379
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:34,809
like oh fuck yeah the only thing that

380
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:37,659
really changed the game over recent is

381
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:40,120
the free Shire I mean I I mean the bags

382
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:47,169
are always fairly similar some people do

383
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:49,028
different sizes no offence separation

384
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:50,349
you get what you pay for you're not if

385
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:53,379
you don't pay good money you're gonna

386
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,300
get a crappy so job it's gonna come

387
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:57,159
apart it's I've seen these things did

388
00:15:55,299 --> 00:16:00,188
you're right fine you gotta have the

389
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:02,469
right strain preferably a nice full term

390
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:04,568
strain yep and then you got to have the

391
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,089
right process and you have those

392
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:08,620
together and the right cure people don't

393
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:10,269
even get the mix of the of the water and

394
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,328
ice right you can have a winner

395
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:16,600
so and winner that's it well so what is

396
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:18,669
your is your mix of there is no there is

397
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,159
no like that you will never know like oh

398
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:22,659
I want four gallons of water for 10

399
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:24,909
pounds of ice or sometimes there's no

400
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:26,110
mix like that you feel it when you're

401
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:27,610
doing this and you've done this for a

402
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,558
long time and you're mixing it by hand

403
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,649
you know that feel there's a sound

404
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:34,688
there's a sound you know when it's those

405
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:36,789
those ice cubes are breaking the heads

406
00:16:34,688 --> 00:16:39,068
off and it's and it's crushing through

407
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:40,688
that weed properly without releasing a

408
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:41,979
massive amount of chlorophyll so you

409
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:43,568
don't have green hash it sound like

410
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:50,188
lawnmower it doesn't sound like one

411
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:50,188
sorry about the lawnmower it's all wrong

412
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:58,240
but you know yeah totally you mean like

413
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:01,568
all around like when we first started

414
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,558
we'd be using buckets and and paddles

415
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:08,048
like little canoe paddles and you just

416
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:11,589
want to just agitate ever so slightly

417
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:15,220
mm-hmm ever so slightly just

418
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:17,500
I I have a very the guy who helps me

419

420
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,519

421
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,400
cannabis Cameron that kid does

422
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,500
everything by himself he will not let

423

anybody in his room he will not let

424
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,720

Rain Man he's like not only am i amazing

427

428
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:42,670
living soil weed so I cultivate and I'm

429

432
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:52,599
little bit just being like you're like

433
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:55,619
and and he's super like quiet and humble

434
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:59,619
and it's weird I met him skimboarding so

435
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:01,209
yeah you're like hey fellows skin border

436
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:02,979

437
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,390
nails game board ends yeah like well I

438
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,860
go skimboarding I'm gonna smoke a bowl

439
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,600
on the beach you know or whatever and

440
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:09,490
he's like no man what's up I got my peak

441
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:12,129
listen you know and then was this over

442
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:14,620
Instagram no like if you skim board it's

443
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,690
a very small there's probably like 20 of

444
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:18,279
us you know what I mean and there's not

445
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,750
very many places you can actually skim

446
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:21,940
board so where do you like to do it

447
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,490
skimboarding here is done mostly in

448
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,769
Malibu and north like as soon as you get

449
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,960
north of county line and is that because

450
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:30,970
you have like one like high tide to look

451
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,059
okay yeah the APUs Beach and you always

452
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,589
go like about an hour before high tide

453
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:37,629
it's clutch but the skimboard mecca of

454
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:38,709
the world is Laguna Beach and don't know

455
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,970
yeah sure

456
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:44,769
never ever change listen we're not in

457
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,440
this skimboarding it's a way the beaches

458
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:49,930
are set up every Beach around their

459
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,029
breaks perfect the only one that like is

460
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,039
out of Laguna Beach that's that's

461
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:57,190
awesome is the wedge and that's very

462
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:59,319
finicky so but it here is the

463
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:02,740
skimboarding mecca just like here's the

464
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,779
mecca of boutique weed and they're the

465
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,940
stuff that you well just don't go for a

466
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:09,109
lot of things I went to Amsterdam so

467
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,170
many times you can't find we'd like

468
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:13,909
here it doesn't exist it you go to go to

469
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,590
Colorado I don't care

470
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,360
they all got it legal you can't grow a

471
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:19,069
wheel I can grow wheat here specifically

472
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,439
because the elevation can't grow

473
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:23,419
bomb-ass you think about 5,000 feet up

474
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,789
almost got the same exact kind of

475
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,220
exactly climate like they have examples

476
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:30,769
of Istanbul and up in the hills of

477
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:33,410

despised you can't dispute that sir I

487
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,870
wish I could find better

488
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:58,940
well bodies we got some good weed down

489
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:02,089
here well how about this of the indoor

490
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:09,890
you like like is it grown and soil is it

491
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:12,529
grown hydro is a it in all reality I've

492
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:15,140
had every single way grown and enjoy all

493
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:20,029
those and have every single wade you

494
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:21,679
know cocoa soil hydro if it's indoor and

495
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:23,210
it's grown in Southern California it's

496
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,309
gonna be better than anywhere else I

497
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,079
don't care what anybody said this if you

498
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,579
do it the same way it there's no

499
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:32,210
possible way I could come out better

500
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:34,250
just geographical it's like geography

501
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,900
matters with indoor oh yeah absolutely

502
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,019
wonder percent anybody who says that

503
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,030
that your indoor is not determined by

504
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:43,700
your outside factors is wrong your

505
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:45,529
indoor no matter how sealed your room is

506
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,750
you can't seal prep you can't make

507
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:50,808
pressure you can't make atmospheric

508
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,058
pressure you can't if it's if if the

509
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:54,918
Santa Anas are out in the valley your

510
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:56,720
weed will drop the driveway slower than

511
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,820
it would if it was raining outside I

512
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,808
don't care if it's indoor it changes

513
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:04,490
there is a difference from growing it

514
00:21:01,808 --> 00:21:06,769
anywhere in the world then grow in here

515
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,589
I don't know if I totally you don't

516
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:10,308
believe in really slimy indoor here in

517
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:13,159
door there

518
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:15,889
it's I still do do you not agree with me

519
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,290
that outside factors will always they

520
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:21,830
will must still control it less less

521
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:22,879
right like like elevation barometric

522
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:26,269
pressure

523
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,280
like certain things will have a factor

524
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:30,139
but other things you can't say so you're

525
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:34,039
having fewer things that are out of or

526
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,570
that are microclimate dependent yeah and

527
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,759
what I'm telling you is the fact that

528
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:39,470
you don't have to actually put any

529
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:44,299
effort into having the perfect

530
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:51,620
parameters which is what is here through

531
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:53,329
a B hey smell the hash yes I mean

532
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:55,009
there's so many little details you can

533
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:58,029
dial in now and but that's what I'm

534
00:21:55,009 --> 00:22:02,329
saying is so something tied in perfectly

535
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:03,799
in another area you have to keep it so

536
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:05,419
dialed in here you don't have to do

537
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:07,750
anything that's why it always comes out

538
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,710
better is this is the optimum

539
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,569
everything's optimum here so you don't

540
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,400
have to have huge skill level and you'll

541
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:15,889
still do well you still need some sort

542
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,750
of yeah but it's like playing with an

543
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,070
oversized tennis racket or something

544
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,539
what I'm trying to explain to you need

545
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:22,399
spots much bigger let's just say you're

546
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:26,059
taking one factor of it just one factor

547
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,850
of it just humidity okay one factor of

548
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:31,339
humidity okay the humidity levels here

549
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:33,379
where we live growing indoor is way

550
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:35,569
easier to combat and to deal with with

551
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,950
one freaking dehumidifier then it would

552
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:39,529
be anywhere else in the country to grow

553
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,019
pot in Florida in the summer do

554
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:44,000
Minnesota okay anywhere you're gonna go

555
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:46,670
it's gonna be more humid you're gonna

556
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,309
have harder chance to do things you have

557
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:52,160
to humble very humid or even more dry

558
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:53,869
you can't go to bury the Bay Area's got

559
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,670
a great climate but Stella's you're

560
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:58,099
still saying California share you're

561
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,140
still saying how fortunately III will I

562
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:03,619
will agree with you go from roughly like

563
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,600
like our Qaeda to San Diego is the

564
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:07,759
greatest and you can't go very far

565
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,429
inland either the further you go inland

566
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,289
the least the worse the minute you go

567
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,779
kind of around that band globally and

568
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:17,839
find other spots that are kind of

569
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:19,730
similar like as they say exactly on the

570
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,250
other side of the the map is at the

571
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,860
Afghani mountains and and those rejects

572
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:27,230
so so that's why it does grow there also

573
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:30,379
but it's not the same topography its

574
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:33,890
topography ocean the way the the way the

575
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,200
freakin currents is all that BS yeah do

576
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,700
you think just the Oh

577
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,850
hemp that's planet they don't even water

578
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:44,169
it they don't water that in camarillo it

579
00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:51,148
grows like wild and it looks like crazy

580
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:51,149
you're like okay there's that's crazy

581
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,548
you're like and there's and there's weed

582
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:05,048
like all along the side of the road you

583
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:08,528
just walk up and grab the plant they

584
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:10,388
don't care that's crazy yeah it

585
00:24:08,528 --> 00:24:13,089
literally and they said they barely

586
00:24:10,388 --> 00:24:15,869
water it due to the geographical area

587
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:19,839
where it is and how much ocean you know

588
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:22,629
mist and all that overcast comes in they

589
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,980
barely water it and there and there's no

590
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,990
harvest and they're harvesting this

591
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,360
massive amount of hemp and getting a

592
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,620
huge amount of money for it and now they

593
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:31,869
don't have to water their crops like

594
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:34,119
they were watering you know the peppers

595
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:35,589
and the in the cabbage and whatever else

596
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,719
that they were growing they've just

597
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:41,439
legalized it up in Humboldt County too

598
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:45,509
and for him for him is that everyone

599
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,509
yeah farmers aren't too happy about it

600
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:54,370
and thank you what they're doing is just

601
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,289
by the way I did it like a two and a

602
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:59,859
half hour conversation with cam

603
00:24:56,288 --> 00:25:03,490
and him and Fred had like he's amazing

604
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:05,408
like thirst-quenching drinks and I

605
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,240
realized as we started to fill me that I

606
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:09,549
had no water or anything we got super

607
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:13,470
high so for two and a half hours I had

608
00:25:09,548 --> 00:25:18,970
nothing to drink while they're like so

609
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:20,409
thirst quenching the worst yeah so

610
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,720
they're growing hemp up in Humble now

611
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:25,120
finally it's been on a moratorium for a

612
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,679
long time they were not allowing it but

613
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,349
where they're doing it is in all the

614
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,070
farmland in the bottoms to grow they've

615
00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:36,609
got different hip zones well I saw

616
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:39,548
something recently posted like Humboldt

617
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:43,178
now is gonna have more cannabis licenses

618
00:25:39,548 --> 00:25:45,730
than Santa Barbara and more acreage of

619
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:47,169
cultivation and I was like say what yeah

620
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,980
because Santa Barbara is the biggest

621
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:50,950
right now

622
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,620
bye-bye-bye like multiples anything I

623
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:56,558
want to understand what that means like

624
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:59,619
did something just happen local

625
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,359
regulatory why's that changed or well

626
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:02,888
they have this moratorium thanks we're

627
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,199
happy this is going what's going on with

628
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:07,298
cultivation in humble give this like

629
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,710
tell us a sec you to say who it's hot

630
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:15,788
yeah I got you don't worry yeah they're

631
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:17,620
um I like the building opportunities the

632
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:18,669
sustainable building opportunities I

633
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:22,089
think you should build building

634
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:23,679
materials fuel out of him that's where I

635
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:27,269
think him should go so I'm really

636
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,679
excited about that yeah I think you know

637
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:31,298
the plastics and stuff that they build

638
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,590
with him but is is the way to go they're

639
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,339
building houses they're doing all sorts

640
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:37,480
of crazy things

641
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:39,970
yeah well the kind of the infrastructure

642
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,329
to get stuff from raw material you know

643
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:47,350
Robert like petroleum has how many years

644
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:50,019
of creating equipment and processes to

645
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:52,959
get to every form factor of biomaterial

646
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:55,269
it's ridiculous the amount of trash and

647
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,889
waste we have I can't even know some of

648
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:58,419
the like I'd love to start like I want
