1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:14,159
I forgot you had my full bio so it's

2
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:17,939
grimacing a little up here I gotta

3
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:19,410
shorten that thing great well so I'm

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,660
really excited to be here today

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,120
Oren get deep into some science I'll

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,649
leave a ton of time at the end for

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,850
question and answers I'm sure you guys

8
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:38,039
will have a lot so let's get started in

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:40,260
the game of cannabinoids great alright

10
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,839
so first brief Alan wouldn't be talking

11
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,979
about today so we'll compare how how do

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,050
we utilize the plant to produce

13
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,059
cannabinoids how can we utilize other

14
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,738
formats whether using chemical synthesis

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,109
and beakers or we kinetically

16
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,959
programming bacteria to produce

17
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:56,250
cannabinoids we'll talk a bit about the

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,530
cost because that's gonna be a huge

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,659
driver of who's gonna win this this game

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,700
of cannabinoids I will talk about some

21
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,170
of the potential effectiveness efficacy

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,400
effectiveness is it going to be the same

23
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,530
it's gonna be different depending on

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,030
where you source your cannabinoids from

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,769
and we'll talk about some of the the

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,870
regulatory landscape which is probably

27
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,478
the most complicated part of this that

28
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,060
we need to tease through so let's get

29
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,459
started I'll first just briefly overview

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,409
what how the plant produces cannabinoids

31
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,390
so here's what a plant does right so

32
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,810
it's taking carbon dioxide out of the

33
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,609
atmosphere and it's fixing that carbon

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,650
and building sugar is what it's doing

35
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,750
right and once it's built that sugar it

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,640
can then take that sugar and shrimp and

37
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,010
and transform it into a variety of other

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,629
compounds so what the cannabis plant

39
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,299
does is it takes carbon dioxide to form

40
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,039
sugar and so from sugar and through a

41
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,868
series of steps which I will just kind

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,790
of abbreviate it'll take that sugar

43
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:49,950
converted a compound a then convert a

44
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,450
compound C then D then e then F and then

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,579
eventually it's turned into a

46
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,530
cannabinoid dozens of steps later as

47
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,078
outlined in this diagram right here

48
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,820
don't worry about the details literally

49
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,529
don't there's so many enzymatic pathways

50
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,118
and intermediate compounds but just know

51
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,030
that eventually that sugar through a

52
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:09,868
series of steps eight abcdefg z is made

53
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,219
into CB g and CB g is the precursor to

54
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:12,780
many Kanab

55
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:14,330
the way you can remember that is the the

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,710
it's the og it's the original

57
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,800
cannabinoid that then is made into THC

58
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,210
CBD etc okay and the reason this becomes

59
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,960
important is when we start talking about

60
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,650
how you can make bacteria produce

61
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,230
cannabinoids you've got to figure out

62
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:32,189
where in this sequence of steps can I

63
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:34,859
utilize the bacteria to produce to do

64
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:37,859
those steps and also keep in mind that

65
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,410
this is not happening in a vacuum so the

66
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,170
cell in the plant or any cell for that

67
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:44,909
matter it's like a little city and parts

68
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:47,069
of that cell are dedicated to producing

69
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:48,810
energy so it's like look at the local

70
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,299
coal plant producing energy for the

71
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,370
entire cell other parts of the cell are

72
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,590
factories they're producing certain

73
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,509
things in the case of certain cannabis

74
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,789
cells they're producing cannabinoids

75
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:01,859
right but there's also parts of the city

76
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:04,310
that are use for defense or for all of

77
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,530
this stuff so it's a very complicated

78
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,000
landscape and so but what if there's a

79
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,250
way that we could just take the

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,990
factories making cannabinoids and take

81
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,080
advantage of that one piece in the cell

82
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,719
and I'll talk more about that down the

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,860
road the other thing about cannabinoid

84
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,300
production and the cannabis plant I'm

85
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,340
sure as you all realize is it is not

86
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,019
optimized throughout the entire growth

87
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,539
phase of the cannabis plant you really

88
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,340
only get robust cannabis production or

89
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:30,840
cannabinoid production in a very

90
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,189
specific part of the cannabis plant

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,159
right the the floral parts and only in

92
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:39,239
unfertilized female flower so it's not

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,239
optimal that means you're kind of

94
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,530
wasting all this time in the plant phase

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,719
where it's not producing the real

96
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,330
compound you're interested in so how do

97
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,669
we optimize that and furthermore it's

98
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,110
only stored in this one small part of

99
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:54,119
the plant and the trichrome that's not

100
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,769
stored throughout the plant so now not

101
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,569
only are you limited to this kind of

102
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,459
time cycle of the plant you're really

103
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,409
only limited to a certain portion of the

104
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,759
plant and the reason cannabinoids are

105
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,370
stored in Tri Chrome's is number one

106
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:08,689
they're fat soluble so that they can't

107
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,640
really exist in the aqueous Lea no leaf

108
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:13,530
parts of the cannabis plant and they're

109
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,819
actually toxic to the plant that's why

110
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,589
they're stored in these protective

111
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:20,759
little bulbous orbs okay all right this

112
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,619
will all become more important in a

113
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,269
second now when you try to do an

114
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,540
extraction from the cannabis plant you

115
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:28,259
have

116
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,450
to spend a lot of time and energy to get

117
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,490
rid of all the other unwanted compounds

118
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:34,139
so when you do an initial extraction of

119
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,400
the cannabis plant you're basically

120
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,669
pulling things based on their chemical

121
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:41,039
properties so yes you pull cannabinoids

122
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,689
but at the same time you're gonna pull a

123
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,700
bunch of other stuff from the plant

124
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:46,860
because that other stuff has similar

125
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,870
properties chemical properties to the

126
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,420
cannabinoids and so you're in a pole

127
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,620
chlorophyll are gonna pull plant lipids

128
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,640
and waxes you're gonna pull other

129
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,889
cannabinoids you're gonna pull

130
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,269
flavonoids and all this junk and then

131
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,750
you have to go through all of these

132
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:02,339
steps to get rid of all of that extra

133
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,129
junk and that's gonna create a lot of

134
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,599
cost so how efficient is it when we use

135
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:08,699
the plant and we're just interested in a

136
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,710
handful of compounds we just spend all

137
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,539
this time and energy getting rid of all

138
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:15,599
the other stuff that came along for the

139
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,960
ride in the initial extraction so how do

140
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,180
we optimize for that okay so that's

141
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,279
putting that aside for a second let's

142
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,860
talk about some of the chemical are the

143
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,149
synthetic processes the non cannabis

144
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,980
plant processes that you can make

145
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:30,389
cannabinoids so there's chemical

146
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,370
synthesis where you're building things

147
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,969
in beakers you're not using living

148
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,860
systems

149
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,360
then there's cellular biosynthesis where

150
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,980
you're genetically engineering cells to

151
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,629
produce cannabinoids then there's

152
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,830
cell-free biosynthesis where you don't

153
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:42,899
even need the cell you don't need the

154
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:45,120
whole city I just want the one factory

155
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,500
in that city that makes cannabinoids how

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,329
do i harness that and I'll walk you

157
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:54,209
through each one of these ok so chemical

158
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:55,620
synthesis you have you know beakers you

159
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:58,739
don't have any living organisms and

160
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,240
you're just basically building one

161
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,910
molecular building block at a time

162
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,199
you're rebuilding your cannabinoid but

163
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,939
cannabinoid is a pretty complicated

164
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,769
molecule and so for all intents and

165
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:09,540
purposes chemical synthesis might not be

166
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:11,310
the most cost efficient way to do this

167
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,590
also it's not the most sustainable

168
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,689
because all of the reagents you have to

169
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:16,859
use at each step of your chemical

170
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:19,969
synthesis these are things that you

171
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,930
can't dispose of very readily and

172
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,360
furthermore this can be very inefficient

173
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,280
so when you're trying to each step of

174
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,310
this process you end up actually

175
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,839
creating a lot of similar but non

176
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,129
identical compounds so then you still

177
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,709
have to go through filtration and

178
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:37,319
separation and all of this stuff

179
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:38,219
so for the rest of this talk I'm not

180
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,839
going to talk about this too much

181
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,760
because I don't think this is the future

182
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,109
of cannabinoid production from both a

183
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,839
cost standpoint a sustainability

184
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,629
standpoint what gets much more

185
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,459
interesting is biosynthesis so the same

186
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:52,500
way that the cannabis plant takes sugar

187
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:53,939
walks it through a series of steps to

188
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,680
produce a cannabinoid we could engineer

189
00:06:53,939 --> 00:07:01,410
a cell that exists in a bioreactor and

190
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,360
that cell can also take a sugar and walk

191
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,040
it through those same steps and output a

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,990
cannabinoid and then I don't have to

193
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,960
deal with growing this plant and all of

194
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,840
this stuff okay now before I talk more

195
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:27,029
about this let's talk about the history

196
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:32,279
of cellular biosynthesis there we go

197
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:34,589
so prior to the 1960s the way that we

198
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:38,399
treated diabetics was that we would take

199
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:41,909
animal pancreas mainly Pig pancreas we

200
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,979
grind it up and we'd extract the insulin

201
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,290
out of the pancreas and then we go

202
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,930
through a very complicated series of

203
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,100
steps of extraction and purification not

204
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,670
too different than what we do with

205
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:56,160
cannabis to produce roughly purified

206
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,660
insulin but it wasn't very pure it

207
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,340
wasn't very consistent you would give it

208
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,280
to patients and sometimes you would

209
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:04,229
create sometimes lethal reactions to it

210
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,599
because batch to batch it was different

211
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,189
the porcine pancreas is just like

212
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,930
cannabis plants are different batch to

213
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:12,300
batch and you really only wanted one

214
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,680
molecule that insulin but all this extra

215
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,090
stuff came along for the ride when you

216
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,220
did your extraction so you'd spend all

217
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:21,209
this time purifying all that other stuff

218
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:24,090
out so in the 60s they figured out a

219
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,819
better way to do this and it was

220
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:28,919
Genentech and this is what made them a

221
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:32,159
billion-dollar company so they said okay

222
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,100
let's figure out what is the actual DNA

223
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,469
strand in the human pancreas cell that's

224
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,659
responsible for insulin production let's

225
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:42,600
take out that piece of DNA and let's

226
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,490
stick it in a bacteria and then when we

227
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,800
boot up the bacteria lo and behold it

228
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,120
starts producing insulin so they

229
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,389
basically took a

230
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,360
one way to think about this is they took

231
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:56,459
they took the code they took the code

232
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,129
that codes for if there's like computer

233
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:01,109
software code they took the code that

234
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:02,819
codes for insulin out of the human cell

235
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,199
put it into a different you know

236
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:05,759
computer and then booted up that

237
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:07,258
computer and that computer is now

238
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,789
reading that code and doing what that

239
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,039
code is instructing and that's how we

240
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:14,188
got insulin and so then we never needed

241
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,078
to use animal pancreas again so this was

242
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:18,120
in this is 50 years ago so this is not

243
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:22,378
new technology biosynthesis bio

244
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,759
synthetic production of compounds all

245
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:28,289
right now let's take this one step

246
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,759
further and so these are some of the

247
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:31,948
companies that have popped up to try and

248
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:42,438
do this there's a lot of companies

249
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:46,769
working in this space next one next one

250
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:48,360
okay so what you know in theory this

251
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:51,419
sounds simple but I think there's a lot

252
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,318
of nuances in how companies are gonna go

253
00:09:51,419 --> 00:10:00,899
about doing this

254
00:09:52,318 --> 00:10:03,360
so first what type of microorganism

255
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,578
they're gonna use is gonna be bacteria

256
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,829
is it going to be a fungi is it going to

257
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:09,448
be algae and each back each type of

258
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:11,278
microorganism has its own peculiarities

259
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:12,778
what food you need to feed it

260
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,328
what type of trick does it grow well at

261
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:19,850
things like that how easy is it to

262
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:19,849
insert your DNA into that microorganism

263
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:25,499
what yeah exactly well input and output

264
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,208
so are you feeding it sugar and that

265
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:30,058
organism has been genetically engineered

266
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:32,088
to take sugar all the way down to

267
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:34,948
cannabinoid through dozens of steps or

268
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:36,990
are you feeding it an intermediary

269
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:38,909
compound so rather than feeding it a and

270
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,428
having a transform it to Z are you

271
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:43,499
feeding it like Q and it can take it to

272
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:45,928
Z then you have to go spend time and

273
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:47,069
energy creating q right ideally you'd be

274
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:47,909
able to give it sugar and take it all

275
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:50,428
the way through but that's gonna be very

276
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:52,578
tough because of all the steps involved

277
00:10:50,428 --> 00:10:54,600
so it might be that you create a

278
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:56,370
moderately expensive intermediate

279
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,259
compound and then have the cell take it

280
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,360
all the way through than the last one

281
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:01,389
and then you know do these cells keep

282
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,310
all the contents

283
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,889
of them or can you engineer them to then

284
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:07,059
you know kick out the cannabinoids once

285
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:09,039
they're done because then it's even

286
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:10,179
easier to for you to get a hold of it

287
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:11,740
it's just floating in the aqueous

288
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:13,839
material you don't have to lyse the

289
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:18,190
cells burst the cells open and get the

290
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,850
compound of interest okay take it a step

291
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,320
further

292
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,420
remember the analogy I said about the

293
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,240
city so in the previous example we're

294
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:27,490
saying why don't we rebuild an entire

295
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,799
cellular city with its own life-support

296
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,810
system its own hospitals and Gardens and

297
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:34,809
roads and all this stuff and cannabinoid

298
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:37,029
factories or what if we just take

299
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:39,489
advantage of the one cannabinoid Factory

300
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:42,009
in the city and ditch the city and so

301
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,810
that's what one of our faculty at UCLA

302
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:46,389
has been working on so again

303
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:51,959
traditionally so instead of building the

304
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:54,519
city he just focuses on now it's working

305
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,590
it's called cell free biosynthesis he

306
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,509
just takes the enzymes the cellular

307
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,440
factories for cannabinoids puts those in

308
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,269
a bioreactor

309
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,950
and he's theoretically able to produce

310
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:05,439
cannabinoids this is still really really

311
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,300
early proof of concept stuff it's gonna

312
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,250
be years before it's it will know if

313
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:11,949
it's viable at scale but people are

314
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,690
working on this and again the advantages

315
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,150
are now you no longer have to deal with

316
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,760
the cells so not only we so we've jumped

317
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:20,889
from plant to you know bacteria and

318
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,830
bioreactor but that bacteria is still

319
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:26,019
fickle it produces waste products right

320
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,370
it needs and you need to feed it sugar

321
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:28,809
to keep it alive it produces all sorts

322
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,000
of other stuff

323
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:32,739
now with let's get rid of the cell let's

324
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,419
just have the factory and then it's just

325
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,560
super it only produces one thing and

326
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:37,240
there's no waste products it only

327
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:39,239
produces cannabinoids you don't really

328
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,850
need to feed it sugar to keep it alive

329
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,159
and so based off that he's created a

330
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,960
spin-out company in design all right so

331
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:48,669
to sum it up what are the kind of

332
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,210
advantages and disadvantages of this

333
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:53,559
approach so first off you and you Accu

334
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:57,040
can actually argue that this is more

335
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:58,839
environmentally sustainable than growing

336
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,279
the cannabis plant you don't need lots

337
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,759
of arable land you don't need lots of

338
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:05,620
water you don't need fertilizer you

339
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,019
don't need to spend all this time and

340
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,399
energy to grow the plant to only extract

341
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:12,579
out a small portion of it and then

342
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:15,278
purify that it could be potentially

343
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,259
cheaper I'll talk more about that later

344
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,328
it's a lot easier to scale so if I have

345
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:22,028
a hundred acre cannabis farm and I want

346
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:23,409
to 10x my output how quickly can I go

347
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:25,269
from a hundred acre cannabis farm to a

348
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:26,740
thousand acre cannabis farm that might

349
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:29,769
take me a couple years to ramp up that

350
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:33,459
capacity but if you're growing enough of

351
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:36,129
your synthetic creatures in a 10 liter

352
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:38,679
bioreactor the you can scale in a couple

353
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:40,209
months I just buy ten other bioreactors

354
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,328
and I stick it in a room and I'm ready

355
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:44,588
to go so it's a lot more scalable

356
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:46,059
potentially more consistent again my

357
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,949
cells are just producing the one thing

358
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,688
that I want I don't worry about dozens

359
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:51,669
hundreds of compounds that the cannabis

360
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:53,438
plants producing and it's more

361
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:54,729
continuous it's not like I have harvest

362
00:13:53,438 --> 00:13:57,399
to harvest every month I could be

363
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,490
growing cells for a couple days at a

364
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:03,458
time and getting cannabinoids out of it

365
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:07,060
what are the downsides huge upfront Rd

366
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:10,299
cost right massive upfront R&amp;D costs and

367
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:12,899
there's regulatory issues how is this

368
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:15,519
regulated under medical marijuana laws

369
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:17,259
is it regulated under like where does

370
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,730
this even fall are you would you be

371
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:21,250
latest allowed to sell this over the

372
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,470
counter marketing issues consumers

373
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,019
clearly would be weirded out if you know

374
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:29,829
your vitamin was brought to you by some

375
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:31,299
bug in a bioreactor and what about all

376
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:32,739
the other potentially beneficial

377
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:34,299
compounds in the cannabis plant the

378
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,459
so-called entourage effect will you be

379
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:39,878
able to recreate that and I'll talk

380
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:42,250
about more on that issue later okay

381
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,209
let's talk about the cost considerations

382
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:48,730
because that's probably one of the

383
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:51,899
biggest advantages of this technology so

384
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,759
these are some these are some prices of

385
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:57,220
commonly used over-the-counter compounds

386
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:00,839
you can buy that are produced by

387
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:04,480
microorganisms and it looks pretty cheap

388
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,490
ten to fifty dollars a kilo for this is

389
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,720
basically fish oil penicillin and a

390
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,490
commonly used vitamin these are

391
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,350
microorganisms that they're using to

392
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,879
produce these so you look at the cost

393
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:17,170
and you're like holy shit for a kilo

394
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:20,438
that's really cheap right so clearly

395
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:22,349
this process over the last 50 years that

396
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:25,599
we've been you know designing these

397
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:28,129
bacteria or microorganisms is we can get

398
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,470
the price down pretty low

399
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:31,850
all right now let's talk about betta

400
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,500
carry off Lane right it's a terpene

401
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,839
found in the cannabis plants also found

402
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,568
in things like black pepper you can buy

403
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,639
naturally derived relatively pure beta

404
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:42,500
carry off lane depending on how much

405
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,850
quantity you can buy anywhere from 20 to

406
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,208
150 bucks a kilo

407
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:50,750
you can also buy synthetic beta carry

408
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:52,909
awfully NAND it's cheaper however that

409
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,519
took the fact that synthetic beta carry

410
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:57,259
awfully exists and is cheaper than the

411
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,750
naturally derived carrot beta carry off

412
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:02,750
Lane it did not completely take down

413
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,730
demand for natural beta carefully and

414
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,559
that's because the makers of herbal

415
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,839
products or fragrance companies they a

416
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,278
lot of them self you know affirm that

417
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,709
they only want a source for natural

418
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:14,600
products so the the the appearance of a

419
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,789
cheaper synthetic source did not just

420
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,889
end the discussion even though these are

421
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:20,990
commodities these are fungible things

422
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:22,370
the the beta carotene is going to do the

423
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:32,448
exact same thing whether its derive

424
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:35,500
synthetically or naturally okay whatever

425
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:38,870
so let's talk about let's compare CBD

426
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,720
versus what bio synthetic CBD might look

427
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:45,019
like the reason I choose CBD derive from

428
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,720
hemp is that's probably what the cost of

429
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:50,000
THC would also look like if marijuana

430
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,759
cannabis were allowed to be grown you

431
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,740
know outdoor 10,000 acres at a time so

432
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,079
whatever price point that we can kind of

433
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,818
theoretically arrive at for CBD that is

434
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:01,729
what and a what THC will look like to

435
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:03,139
once it's grown at scale outdoors as you

436
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:08,419
kind of see happening countries like

437
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:09,740
Colombia and stuff and so what you find

438
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:11,630
is that you could get the price down

439
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,359
from anywhere from tens of dollars to

440
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,640
hundreds of dollars per kilo of

441
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,500
substantially pure CBD derived from hemp

442
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:24,770
grown at scale how did I arrive at that

443
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:27,470
number if you look at opium opioids so a

444
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:29,210
lot of the opioids that we still use in

445
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,308
the pharmaceutical sector are actually

446
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,980
derived from opium plants grown in

447
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:35,960
places like India and then they go and

448
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,548
they extract out the active compounds

449
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,179
purify it and put into a pharmaceutical

450
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:42,319
pill and that those opium products they

451
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,460
sell

452
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,470
even though they're naturally plant

453
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,450
arrived they sell for you knows tens of

454
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,610
tens of dollars per kilo maybe a hundred

455
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,620
dollars per kilo and that's when they're

456
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:53,659
grown at large scale and you have a full

457
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:55,519
supply chain to back it up so again

458
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,500
approaching that price point it would

459
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,470
look very similar to what we see with

460
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,269
opium on the biosynthetic side you're

461
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,400
also gonna get in that range that's

462
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:06,460
because you can look at many other bio

463
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,110
synthetic compounds that are sold in the

464
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,549
nutraceutical sector that approached

465
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:12,349
that similar price point that have

466
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:14,119
similar chemical structures to

467
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:16,399
cannabinoids but now keep in mind this

468
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,750
is you know I'm not gonna pigeonhole

469
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,730
myself and give you a narrow estimate

470
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,410
cuz then in a few years I'll look bad if

471
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,759
it's wrong right so just don't don't

472
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,500
ever predict anything in public it's

473
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:27,349
what somebody taught me so I'm giving

474
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,710
you a huge range here but I want you to

475
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:33,049
see that it's comparable right and that

476
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,930
there's a good chance that you know bio

477
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:37,789
synthetic could be five times cheaper

478
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:41,600
maybe more right depending on where in

479
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:43,369
this range it falls now if you're

480
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,399
talking about deriving it deriving

481
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:48,349
cannabinoids from the plant clearly CBD

482
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,410
is going to be the first cannabinoid to

483
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:53,599
reach an incredibly low cost because of

484
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:56,150
wide scale hemp then it'll be followed

485
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,769
by THC eventually as for the other minor

486
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,420
cannabinoid I don't know if we'll ever

487
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,639
get to that point just because the

488
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,920
current supply of cannabis genetics you

489
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,640
don't have plants that are 25 percent

490
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:10,789
THC V or CBD or all of this so for the

491
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,080
minor cannabinoids I don't it's probably

492
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,730
not going to get to this price point

493
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,129
scan hoping to be significantly higher

494
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,660
and so for the minor cannabinoids I

495
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,310
think it's highly likely that bio

496
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,640
synthetic will be kind of the reigning

497
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:25,039
way to produce the minor cannabinoids

498
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,950
and that's because it's gonna cost the

499
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,049
same whether you're trying to produce

500
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:32,450
THC V or THC in terms of the bio

501
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:34,159
synthetic realm it's just what you're

502
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,440
changing is that you're slightly

503
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,060
modifying the DNA sequence that you're

504
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:44,120
putting into the cells depending on what

505
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:45,679
cannabinoid you want to produce so if if

506
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:48,559
you're talking about just pure

507
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,440
individual cannabinoids and the bio

508
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,960
synthetic process can trump the plant

509
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,809
derived on cost alone is it is it game

510
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,700
over right these are

511
00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:01,179
things are commodities they're identical

512
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:03,420
and if you look at traditional economics

513
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,100
whenever you have commodity pricing and

514
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:09,039
you know the price points go down to

515
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:12,159
where nobody's making any profit and so

516
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,899
is that the case well I think I think

517
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,330
there's another possibility we haven't

518
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,600
explored yet that's gonna give it's

519
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:21,339
gonna give the plant some kanabrocki get

520
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,899
it rocky come on so I think the plant

521
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:24,429
the plant has still got a shot the plant

522
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,120
still got a shot I'll tell you why okay

523
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,769
so here's why you we can get what we

524
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,469
haven't gotten very creative with ways

525
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:35,079
to grow the plant or ways to change the

526
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,779
the metabolism of the plant and how it

527
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:41,379
produces these cannabinoids so there's

528
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:43,329
one company trait Biosciences and what

529
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,860
they have or what they're working on

530
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:47,349
figuring out they've already filed some

531
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:50,409
patents but what they are trying to get

532
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:52,899
the cannabis plant to attach a sugar

533
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,570
molecule to the cannabinoids that it

534
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,490
produces by attaching a simple sugar

535
00:20:55,569 --> 00:21:00,549
molecule to the cannabinoids they

536
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:04,539
suddenly become water-soluble that has

537
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:06,069
many implications so first off you're

538
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:07,480
gonna get higher yields and that's

539
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:09,039
because now that the cannabinoids are

540
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,110
water-soluble they can exist throughout

541
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:15,269
the plant they're not just stuck in the

542
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:17,289
Tri Chrome's on outside of the plant

543
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:18,639
extraction becomes a lot easier to

544
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:20,829
remember what I said extractions

545
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,020
expensive because you're trying to grab

546
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:24,579
for the cannabinoids but you end up

547
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:27,220
grabbing all the other things that have

548
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:29,439
similar chemical properties the fats the

549
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,650
lipids other cannabinoids flavonoids etc

550
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,390
if you have one cannabinoid in your

551
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,400
entire plant that's water soluble you

552
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,290
you don't even need to use like ethanol

553
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,820
and stuff you could you do water

554
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:42,159
extraction right

555
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:44,500
and lastly potentially ease of

556
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,940
formulation if the cannabinoids already

557
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,559
water-soluble they'll mix better into

558
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,480
beverages they might even absorb it'll

559
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:53,980
they probably will absorb better as well

560
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,690
into your body okay and so the other

561
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,250
really interesting kind of game-changing

562
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:02,620
piece oh and this is the company trade

563
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:05,400
Biosciences and so another really

564
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:08,439
interesting implication of this is that

565
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,280
because you're no longer beholden to the

566
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,159
Tri Chrome's

567
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,230
you also no longer beholden to the

568
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,950
flowering of the cannabis plant so you

569
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:20,200
could theoretically yeah

570
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,690
could we just take the plant and veg it

571
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,460
and you could just veg it all day all

572
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,429
day you're just vegging the cannabis

573
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,019
plant it grows up a couple you just cut

574
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,120
it down it grows up you cut it down it

575
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:33,730
grows up you credit down how many years

576
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:38,229
have have you had maybe mother plants

577
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:41,470
last for years years you don't have to

578
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,730
worry about you know nursery clone take

579
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,169
it to flower then the whole thing dies

580
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,690
and I do it all over again you just have

581
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:48,820
one room that every couple weeks you

582
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,200
harvest and you never need to throw it

583
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:51,460
into flower you don't need light

584
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,169
deprivation you'd have to deal with any

585
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,759
of that it's because the cannabinoids

586
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:56,470
are being abundantly produced throughout

587
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:58,839
the plant again now whether they can

588
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,538
actually scale this technology is one

589
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:03,369
thing but they've they've managed to do

590
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:07,538
it at small-scale and file some patents

591
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:13,599
around it okay let's talk about the

592
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:15,640
effectiveness of all of this so again

593
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:18,819
whether it's synthetic or its natural

594
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:21,419
it's gonna do the same thing okay the

595
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:23,829
real question is what else is actually

596
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:26,259
in the plant so CBD is a good example

597
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:28,029
where you hear people say CBD CBD from

598
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:29,558
cannabis isn't as effective as CBD from

599
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:31,269
hemp but the CBD is the same it's gonna

600
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:34,029
do the same thing the real question is

601
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:35,319
what else is accompanying the CBD if

602
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:36,759
you're if you're talking about a hemp

603
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,548
product it's not gonna have a lot of THC

604
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:43,179
right and so let's talk about that this

605
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:46,119
notion of of whole plant and so this is

606
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:47,590
a study where they gave my Speer CBD and

607
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:49,209
they measured inflammation the higher

608
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:52,000
the bars are the more inflammation there

609
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,288
is so what they found was at a low dose

610
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,929
of CBD you still had a lot of

611
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:58,119
inflammation at this middle dose of CBD

612
00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:00,330
you lowered inflammation as you increase

613
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:03,129
the dose again the inflammation returned

614
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:04,928
right so this is not good there's a very

615
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:06,669
narrow window of efficacy so if you're

616
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:10,000
dosing a patient that's not good that

617
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:13,330
was done with pure CBD then they did the

618
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,419
exact same study with a high CBD extract

619
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:18,398
and they matched it so that both mice

620
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:20,620
got the same amount of CBD but this

621
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:21,709
group got all the other stuff that came

622
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:23,509
along for the ride with

623
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,829
whole plant extract and what they found

624
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:26,240
was that the more you gave of that

625
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:29,119
extract that you had a nice reduction

626
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,159
and inflammation without that rebound at

627
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,589
the end so again what's going on here

628
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:35,210
we're not quite sure what compounds in

629
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:38,329
the extract are responsible for this

630
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:40,250
arguably superior dose response curve we

631
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:41,658
don't know okay that's the mystery that

632
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,490
we got to tease apart here's another

633
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:45,049
study where they took breast cancer

634
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,509
cells in a petri dish and they applied

635
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:52,548
THC pure THC to one and they applied a

636
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:55,940
high THC extract to the other and what

637
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:58,278
they what they found was that yes the

638
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,250
pure THC was able to inhibit some key

639
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:04,009
cell cancer cell growth but the high THC

640
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,339
cannabis extract at the same level of

641
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:09,819
THC was able to have significantly more

642
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:12,379
anti-cancer effect and again is it of

643
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:13,879
the dozens or hundreds of other

644
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,100
compounds present in the cannabis

645
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,679
extract which ones responsible for this

646
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:20,538
increased effect is it two of them is it

647
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:21,500
twenty of them is it two hundred you

648
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:23,648
know that's what we're trying to figure

649
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,700
out right now as a scientific community

650
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:27,168
alright last thing regulatory

651
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,100
considerations and I'll open up for Q&amp;A

652
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:34,399
so there's a big mess right now over

653
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:36,288
marketing of food products like people

654
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:38,089
throw out terms you know artificial

655
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:39,769
ingredients all natural all this stuff a

656
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:41,808
lot of those labels aren't well

657
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:43,490
regulated right now like the FDA doesn't

658
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:44,538
have an official definition of what is

659
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,778
actually all-natural

660
00:25:44,538 --> 00:25:50,898
however despite that despite there being

661
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:53,509
unclear regulation the FTC the Federal

662
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:55,729
Trade Commission has independently gone

663
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:58,629
after companies and sued them because

664
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:01,429
they made an all-natural claim that was

665
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,960
interpreted as deceiving the consumer so

666
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:06,230
now you start talking about if you were

667
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,909
if you were able to derive cannabinoids

668
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,259
from other sources would you ever be

669
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:10,909
able to claim your product was

670
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:14,028
all-natural no artificial ingredients

671
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:16,370
that right what does that landscape look

672
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:17,839
like and also people have gone around

673
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:19,788
lawyers will go around filing

674
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,889
class-action lawsuits against companies

675
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:23,629
that inappropriately label as well so

676
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,460
it's not just the government cracking

677
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,350
down its individual groups of lawyers

678
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,620
who will organize class-action lawsuits

679
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:32,148
against companies and so you're saying

680
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,739
you know over half of consumers are

681
00:26:32,148 --> 00:26:35,099
motivated to purchase by the all-natural

682
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,099
claim that

683
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:40,349
not going away anytime soon and and soon

684
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:42,689
in the next couple years the FDA will

685
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:45,028
finally define what it actually means to

686
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,048
be all-natural on a product label so

687
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:49,349
then we'll actually have some strict

688
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:51,359
rules and guidance frito-lay recently

689
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:53,269
pulled the all-natural claims on their

690
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,250
products waiting until the FDA

691
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:57,690
officially puts in its ruling so again

692
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,548
the the companies are taking notice of

693
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,230
this and I think a couple years ago

694
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:04,609
Subway dropped all artificial

695
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:07,019
ingredients from their food including

696
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:08,428
synthetically made versions of naturally

697
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:11,269
occurring compounds so they went with

698
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:14,370
these slightly more expensive natural

699
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:16,378
produced compounds so again this is a

700
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:18,778
trend that's not going away all right so

701
00:27:16,378 --> 00:27:20,339
last thing to think about is depending

702
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:22,980
on where you source your cannabinoids it

703
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:27,480
might impact where you're able to sell

704
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:30,628
it okay so if you are deriving CBD from

705
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,940
cannabis you'll be able to sell it into

706
00:27:30,628 --> 00:27:34,230
the cannabis space that's clear but if

707
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,259
you and when I say cannabis I mean

708
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:40,048
marijuana cannabis not hemp right if

709
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:42,389
you're driving CBD from cannabis you

710
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:44,869
probably won't be able to sell it into

711
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:47,209
the nutraceutical space right

712
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:48,959
it's highly likely that the cannabis

713
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,548
anything produced in the cannabis

714
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,950
ecosystem is going to stay sold in a

715
00:27:50,548 --> 00:27:54,480
highly regulated system and it's

716
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,399
possible you'll be able to sell it into

717
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,139
the pharmaceutical sector in a very

718
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:59,849
regimented fashion and that's what GW

719
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:02,250
pharmaceutical does they grow cannabis

720
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:04,349
in the UK they extract out the CBD

721
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,119
purify it drop it in some oil and sell

722
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,819
it as epidural I was recently FDA

723
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:12,148
approved so that's a possible viable

724
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:15,388
path what if you're deriving your CBD

725
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:16,528
from hemp okay so probably you're not

726
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:18,240
going to be able to sell it into the

727
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,159
cannabis space and that's because the

728
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,769
cannabis industry has its own kind of

729
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:28,440
protectionist measures that they can

730
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:30,230
take you probably will be able to sell

731
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,980
it depending on which government

732
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,048
jurisdiction you're in and to the

733
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,399
nutraceutical sector and you probably

734
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:36,950
will be able to sell it into the

735
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:39,000
pharmaceutical sector and you are seeing

736
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:42,419
pharma companies that are getting ready

737
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,878
to source hemp derived purified CBD for

738
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,769
drug trials but this is this is clearly

739
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:48,189
probably not going to happen because you

740
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:50,470
have all of these cannabis businesses

741
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:53,169
we paid all this money taxes now you're

742
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:56,169
gonna let hem cvd be sold you know and

743
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:57,759
mixed into cannabis products that

744
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:59,470
doesn't seem fair right it's gonna drop

745
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,230
that's gonna put downward price pressure

746
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:04,149
on us and now for the last one by a cent

747
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:05,919
that exceed e where does this fall let's

748
00:29:04,148 --> 00:29:07,449
play a game actually all right what do

749
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,090
we think are they gonna sell it into the

750
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,250
cannabis space yeah or day no probably

751
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:15,009
not for same reason self protectionist

752
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,599
measures there's jobs at stake right so

753
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:17,950
now that all these states have dropped

754
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:20,408
it like are we gonna suddenly replace

755
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,269
all these jobs on these farms now that

756
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:23,440
we're gonna allow this stuff what about

757
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:27,788
the nutraceutical sector what do you

758
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,889
guys think ene it's question mark right

759
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:32,859
there's other examples of bio

760
00:29:29,888 --> 00:29:34,359
synthetically made products that do

761
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:36,369
exist in nature but made by bacteria

762
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,319
that are sold in vitamins and

763
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:39,908
supplements that is exist right so it's

764
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,069
possible depending on how regulators

765
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:43,480
decide to allow it what about bio

766
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:45,460
synthetic CBD for the pharmaceutical

767
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,940
sector that's probably the most relevant

768
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:52,240
use case and these guys want really

769
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,538
really really purified product right so

770
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,509
that probably makes the most sense so

771
00:29:54,538 --> 00:30:00,250
key takeaways and we'll wrap it up the

772
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:03,099
bio synthetic route is going to be

773
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:06,490
cheaper most likely but the one area

774
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:08,619
where it might be comparable is maybe

775
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:10,269
hemp derived CBD because just you could

776
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:11,888
grow that so large-scale and

777
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:13,808
industrialize it but for all the other

778
00:30:11,888 --> 00:30:16,869
cannabinoids bio synthetic is probably

779
00:30:13,808 --> 00:30:19,990
gonna win on cost especially for the

780
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:21,428
minor cannabinoids there is clear

781
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,589
evidence of an entourage effect and that

782
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:24,940
and therefore you might not get that if

783
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:27,428
you're just producing one single

784
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,169
compound of bio synthetic ly consumer

785
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:31,269
perception of what your compound is

786
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:32,590
clearly is important today it will

787
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:34,599
continue to be important going forward

788
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:36,128
and now there are regulations coming in

789
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:39,730
to actually define what is all-natural

790
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:42,308
how is that going to impact that and the

791
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,990
source of where your cannabinoid is

792
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:45,788
likely going to impact your permissible

793
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,950
sales channels so as you can see there's

794
00:30:45,788 --> 00:30:49,658
a lot of considerations at play as to

795
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,740
what the future of cannabinoid

796
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:53,019
production you can leave that there will

797
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:55,329
look like so in terms of wrapping this

798
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:57,429
up in the game of cannabinoids is it you

799
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:59,798
know is it more like you know a civil

800
00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:01,330
war where like the u.s. Civil War we

801
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:01,650
just lined up troops on each side and

802
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:03,599
you just

803
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,190
like hit at each other all day long till

804
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,469
one side gives up right you're just

805
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,299
competing on cost who can who get what's

806
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,900
the race to the bottom I don't think

807
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:13,950
it's like that

808
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:17,550
I think this game is more like game of

809
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:19,200
drones yes right where it's like there's

810
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:20,700
a lot there's like subterfuge and you

811
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,769
have like spies and like they have an

812
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,390
army of like Knights but you have like

813
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:25,920
dragons and there's like magic and

814
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,509
that's and that's because there's so

815
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,519
many factors at play cost is one

816
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:31,079
consideration we talked about cost we

817
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,639
talked about effectiveness we talked

818
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,189
about consumer perception we talked

819
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,250
about regulatory permissible pathways

820
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:40,080
for sales so that is how I see the game

821
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,009
of cannabinoids and I'll open it up for

822
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,009
Q&amp;A

823
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:54,939
so hand in the back of first and then

824
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:58,399
excellent talk very thought-provoking

825
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:00,259
any idea about how you see this being

826
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,830
given to patients is it going to be

827
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:05,538
patch oral and can you comment a little

828
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:08,750
bit about formulations and

829
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:11,750
bioavailability great question so IIIi

830
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:14,359
think oral is probably not going to be a

831
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:16,700
great way to deliver cannabinoids for a

832
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:19,009
very medical purpose and that's just

833
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:22,429
because the the rate of the absorption

834
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:25,940
so variable and so erratic and so that's

835
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:27,409
where things like some sort of a or some

836
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,038
sort of sublingual delivery or OA

837
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:32,360
mucosal delivery could be interesting

838
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:33,859
transdermal could be a very interesting

839
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:37,699
route that's very standardized and

840
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:39,528
stable and it's interesting I actually

841
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,940
think there's a role for inhalation in

842
00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:43,519
some form

843
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,950
definitely not combustion but maybe some

844
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,929
form of vapor vaporization or some form

845
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,390
of aerosolization that's because it's

846
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:51,559
just a very consistent quick easy way to

847
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,240
deliver cannabinoids but I think in

848
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:55,250
terms of oral just like take some

849
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,169
cannabis extract put in a pill I don't

850
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,269
think it's ever going to be what I'm

851
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:01,038
what a medical product would be

852
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:05,168
recognized as just because it's too it's

853
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,169
too inconsistent in its effect

854
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:17,760
Thanks thank you questions about CVD

855
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:21,810
products and label claims versus maybe

856
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:24,660
drug claims of delivery and efficacy and

857
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:27,980
maybe onset and in your opinion is that

858
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:31,890
a safer way for a company to you know

859
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:34,200
kind of Trent like go through their

860
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:35,730
operations as opposed to what happened

861
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,460
like key relief recently where they had

862
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:40,349
to rescind a lot of their claims on CBD

863
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,730
in hemp and I think you know that has a

864
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:43,409
lot to do with the PC services you were

865
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,870
saying yeah so the reason you can't make

866
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:48,750
any claims on CBD is because it's it's

867
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:51,989
an FDA approved pharmaceutical drug and

868
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,759
so you know you can't make any sort of

869
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:55,109
you can make wellness I mean this is

870
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,849
true of any nutraceutical you can make

871
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:59,339
like wellness claims so rather than like

872
00:33:56,849 --> 00:34:01,079
treats your insomnia it's like for a

873
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:03,929
good night's rest right that's kind of

874
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:06,689
how you have to phrase stuff so yeah so

875
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:08,849
so and yeah so the short answer is

876
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,480
disease claimed no it's not gonna be

877
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:11,069
possible

878
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,619
it won't be possible for THC either

879
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:16,710
because THC has been FDA approved since

880
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:19,888
1986 in the form of Marinol 50 yeah

881
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:21,329
uh-huh yeah so you have to stay away

882
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:23,550
from disease claims unless you're

883
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:26,898
willing to go down the pharmaceutical

884
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,899
drug development pipeline oh

885
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:36,300
drug delivery claim drug onset claim

886
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,440
that's interesting that is a little

887
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,440
better you have a little more leeway

888
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,148
there like for quicker onset use our

889
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,648
dissolvable tablets that is do you have

890
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:47,269
a little more leeway there because

891
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:49,859
you're not making a disease claim

892
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:51,269
something different so excellent talk

893
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,829
but i think it's interesting that you

894
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:55,710
were looking for a single winner when

895
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:59,219
you clearly defined in your talk three

896
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,360
different channels to sell it so I can

897
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:01,980
see a world where there's three winners

898
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,470
but and I can see more than that because

899
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,059
as you said the abundance of certain

900
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,589
cannabinoids and other compounds in the

901
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:10,079
plant is different and so you're right

902
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:12,780
you so can you see a world where there's

903
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,719
there are winners that are different in

904
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,760
each of the commercial channels and how

905
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:19,500
much do you think the government so for

906
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,480
example for the pharmaceutical Channel

907
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,340
how much do you think the

908
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,440
da's perception of these compounds

909
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,269
influences things because as a drug

910
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,909
developer I'll let you know that my

911
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:32,429
paperwork is significantly less

912
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:35,219
complicated if I use a synthetic homolog

913
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:37,829
of something yeah so to answer your

914
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:39,329
first question clear like clearly you

915
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:40,650
could you could very quickly be like

916
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:42,539
alright anything derived from cannabis

917
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,579
is gonna float around in the cannabis

918
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,559
industry anything derived from hemp will

919
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:48,179
just go to nutraceutical and then all

920
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,500
the synthetic stuff goes pharmaceutical

921
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,899
but like I said there's a ton of

922
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,780
crosstalk you have pharma companies who

923
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:59,340
are willing and ready to source

924
00:35:53,780 --> 00:36:01,350
synthetic a hemp derived CBD and that's

925
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,090
and GW Pharmaceuticals the one company

926
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:05,069
that has an fda-approved CBD they grow

927
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:07,079
the cannabis plant themselves and they

928
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,970
create extracts from it so there's tons

929
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,789
of crosstalk so I think it would be a

930
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:13,469
bit too it wouldn't do it full justice

931
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:15,570
to just do with those three lanes now in

932
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:17,129
terms of what you said about perception

933
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:20,100
yeah it makes it a lot more difficult

934
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:22,470
when you're trying to go to the FDA and

935
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:24,269
say hey you know approve my drug I

936
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:26,339
guarantee you it's gonna be consistent

937
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:28,019
batch to batch for the next 50 years oh

938
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,340
and by the way I like derive it from a

939
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,250
plant and I take it through all these

940
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,869
purification and extraction processes

941
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,030
that's there that's kind of foreign to

942
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:37,710
them and they have a lot more scrutiny

943
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,210
over those processes they want to make

944
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,130
sure you're growing the plant identical

945
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,480
each time and that you can reliably

946
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,380
reproduce that so it does add

947
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,019
considerable difficulty can you speak to

948
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:58,440
the various CBD formulations and how

949
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:59,519
they'll work with food products so can

950
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,059
you can you clarify the question a

951
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:05,070
little more well the government seems to

952
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:08,250
be at odds about whether it's going to

953
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,510
allow CBD into food products and it's

954
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,150
going back and forth so I'm just

955
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:15,840
wondering if these various CBD

956
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:19,139
formulations Morello I see yeah so the

957
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:21,869
only the only shot of you selling CBD

958
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:23,519
into the as a food product a.k.a dietary

959
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:25,650
ingredient is if it's derived from hemp

960
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,199
that's the only basis you have any

961
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,309
ground to stand on period don't even

962
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:31,108
talk about anything outside that's not

963
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:32,759
going to be allowed the FDA actually is

964
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:34,750
perfectly correct when they say you

965
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,690
cannot sell CBD in food

966
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:41,318
and that's because as soon as CBD

967
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:42,760
entered clinical trials with GW they

968
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:44,858
created basically a moratorium and

969
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,060
that's why you can't sell this stuff and

970
00:37:44,858 --> 00:37:49,119
the food product it's a pharmaceutical

971
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:51,730
drug GW staked its kind of flagpole on

972
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,530
it so it's it's it's actually very clear

973
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,440
that that's not the case now because the

974
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:58,450
FDA is under so much political pressure

975
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,389
from all of the folks who backed hemp as

976
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:02,799
a way to revitalize rural communities

977
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:04,598
predominantly Republican rural

978
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,329
communities that's why the FDA is now

979
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:09,099
willing to make a concession because of

980
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:12,789
this intense political pressure on them

981
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:14,470
to allow CBD so that the hemp farmers

982
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:17,349
can actually grow a valuable crop this

983
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:18,879
is nothing to do with you know them it's

984
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:20,318
all economic development of these rural

985
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,030
communities that's the driving factor

986
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:23,469
behind these conversations right now in

987
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:25,750
terms of the formulations for the food

988
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:27,578
products yeah it's really it's the hemp

989
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:30,280
derived stuff that's gonna be there you

990
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:31,630
I mean going forward here's likely

991
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,060
what's gonna happen is the FDA will come

992
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:36,068
in and say okay here's the maximum

993
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:37,960
amount of CBD you can put into a pill or

994
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:40,539
a bottle

995
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,880
it cannot be overly purified beyond this

996
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:45,009
percentage so keeping it more of a hemp

997
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,900
extract as opposed to a pure CBD which

998
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,849
that's clearly a pharmaceutical drug and

999
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,608
maybe you have to go through these

1000
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:53,230
testing labs that we've done some we've

1001
00:38:51,608 --> 00:38:55,420
given them a license to certify that

1002
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,650
your CBD product is accurate I suspect

1003
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,690
that's somewhere where the FDA might

1004
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:01,720
fall in the coming months and years as

1005
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:05,889
they figure out the regulation we have

1006
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:07,389
one more question okay great

1007
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:09,549
presentation Thanks

1008
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:11,400
question is have you seen any studies

1009
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:14,140
that you know they're talking about

1010
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,519
reintroducing terpenes and the entourage

1011
00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:18,098
effect have you seen any studies that

1012
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:21,429
deal with the increased or decreased

1013
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:23,769
efficacy of of terpenes when they're

1014
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:25,719
reintroduced versus naturally occurring

1015
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:28,358
short answer no and that's only because

1016
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:30,039
we have been there's literally I could

1017
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:31,119
count on one hand the number of studies

1018
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:33,608
that have compared

1019
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,410
pure cannabinoid to cannabis extract

1020
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:37,779
head-to-head so we don't even really

1021
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:39,879
know if the entourage effect if it's

1022
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:42,369
like how real it is or like when it

1023
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,289
actually occurs and we don't even we

1024
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:46,820
remotely understand and start comparing

1025
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:49,309
you know a

1026
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,440
ahem extract versus one that was like

1027
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:53,630
fractionated and then reconstituted into

1028
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,730
a specific combination we're not we're

1029
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,440
not there yet I will say though DeeDee

1030
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,900
Murray out of Israel has done some

1031
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,019
studies where he takes a whole extract

1032
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:05,240
cannabis extract and he'll sequentially

1033
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:07,250
break it into chunks and what he's

1034
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:09,559
trying to do is to arrive at the minimum

1035
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,869
amount of compounds from that full

1036
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:14,090
extract that recreate the full extracts

1037
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:15,469
effects and in one particular cancer

1038
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,420
cell line he was looking at he found

1039
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:20,149
that it came down to four it was four

1040
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,829
ingredients that he isolated that when

1041
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,809
combined could recreate the whole plant

1042
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:26,299
extract but that's for these cancer cell

1043
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:30,139
lines maybe for other disorders you need

1044
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,700
less maybe you need more so I was just

1045
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:35,619
curious if you know of any

1046
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:38,299
pharmaceutical companies growing

1047
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:41,359
cannabis so that it will have a higher

1048
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:43,100
amount of minor cannabinoids you were

1049
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,559
talking about that may be the future

1050
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:47,299
yeah so it's not so much pharmaceutical

1051
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:48,920
companies to my knowledge there's only

1052
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,050
like one pharmaceutical company growing

1053
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,090
cannabis its GW I think all the

1054
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:55,810
pharmaceutical companies now are just

1055
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:59,410
gonna work with and purchase their

1056
00:40:55,809 --> 00:41:01,159
cannabinoids from cannabis companies

1057
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:02,420
predominately right now Canadian

1058
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,250
cannabis companies because they're

1059
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,740
creating kind of like the cleanest most

1060
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:09,380
pharmaceutical grade stuff in terms of

1061
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:11,029
your question which was minor

1062
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,320
cannabinoids yes it's not so much pharma

1063
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,690
companies it's all these cannabis

1064
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,390
genetic companies breeders they're all

1065
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,530
scrambling to get these rare genetics

1066
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:20,480
that have high amounts of these minor

1067
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:22,070
cannabinoids and it's because you know

1068
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,730
what does this see what is a kilo of CBD

1069
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:26,030
isolate sell for right now five thousand

1070
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,340
dollars

1071
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:31,910
what is a kilo CBG isolate sell for

1072
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,720
right now or THC V a hundred grand fifty

1073
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:34,129
to a hundred grand

1074
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:37,759
right it's that much more valuable

1075
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,960
because it's so rare so yeah so it's

1076
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,430
really the breeder is the plant breeders

1077
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,690
in genetic genetics guys right now are

1078
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:46,599
scrambling to find those genetics they

1079
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:50,130
realize how valuable it is okay

1080
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:50,130
all right great thank you guys
