1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,509
there's another interesting aspect about

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:07,048
Canadian law people don't really

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:09,839
understand if you take them to a small

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:13,289
trial in the United States and your your

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:16,528
formulation shows efficacy you are then

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:19,320
required to go the FDA render you can't

7
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:21,539
take it to the market it's now shown

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,469
efficacy you have to go through the full

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,090
whole-hog FDA testing in Canada and

10
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:29,669
that's hundreds of millions of dollars

11
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,789
in Canada we can take some of our

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,730
formulations do a trial a small trial

13
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:38,339
that shows that it's efficacious and go

14
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:41,909
a nutraceutical route it starts selling

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,100
it immediately and making claims of what

16
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:47,549
it does based on the documented study

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,469
that we did that's an avenue the United

18
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:53,628
States's approach keeps medicine off the

19
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,629
shelves keeps remedies officer
