1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
we'll end with one viewer question Jemma

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,669
do you want to say hi what what have you

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:16,920
been doing while we've been talking no

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:19,679
what have you been doing it so so we got

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,868
one Lydia will let you go because I know

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,679
that he has to leave a viewer question

7
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:28,140
let me cue it hey what's up guys this is

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,539
blue of green tank I'm a cultivator in

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,700
coastal Maine and I really appreciate

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,870
you fielding questions like this my

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,430
question revolves around living soil and

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:40,859
decomposition rates and nutrient cycling

13
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:43,950
from season to season in a greenhouse

14
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:46,378
that is not climate controlled alright

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,620
so what we have here is a couple of

16
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:53,460
grass roots fabric beds a living soil

17
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:57,390
Edition equipped with blue matte blue

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,509
soap and I built the soil that the

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,100
intention was high porosity good

20
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:05,280
drainage and getting away from the use

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,320
of unsustainable peat and so what I did

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,010
is I used a greater proportion of rice

23
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:28,048
holes in the soil and I would say

24
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:30,600
outfitted it with a proprietary Feria

25
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,850
mushroom spawn and we have a nice thick

26
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,359
mat here and then I laid down my blue

27
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:38,938
soak and everything did really well last

28
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,099
season and now going into this season I

29
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:44,459
was surprised and looking in a few spots

30
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:46,500
that the rate of decomposition from what

31
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:51,899
I'm used to inside in my living soil

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:56,989
systems is far lower and so my main

33
00:01:51,899 --> 00:02:00,180
question is what can I do in this bed to

34
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:02,039
stimulate some rapid decomposition to

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,259
ensure that I have enough nutrient

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,769
cycling to provide my plants of what I

37
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:11,229
need this year so if you have any

38
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:13,180
suggestions whether it be a more of an

39
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:15,280
ocular of worms as you can see there's

40
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,280
one Slytherin buyer right here so they

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,979
have survived the winter but I figured

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,669
that they would self populate or maybe a

43
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:26,289
sprouted seed tea or compost extract

44
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:30,009
wondering what you guys would recommend

45
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:34,449
I appreciate it thanks in advance all

46
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:38,530
right Scott I'm gonna let the wife get

47
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:40,060
this one all right Sarah do a wife that

48
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:50,920
was that was a longtime viewer

49
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:54,610
first-time caller yeah yeah well first

50
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:56,939
of all I would say there's a couple of

51
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,579
things off the bat that I would kind of

52
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:02,620
steer on this is that anytime you're

53
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:04,180
wanting to increase the nutrient cycling

54
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,950
in a system you need to quantify what

55
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,540
you have first and what that balance

56
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:08,738
looks like so I would get a quantified

57
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:11,469
because you don't really know what you

58
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,870
got and where you need to address the

59
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:16,689
issues or any changes until until you

60
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:19,359
take a look so I would quantify that if

61
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:21,549
you're serious about this the second

62
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:24,129
thing is is you weren't a natural

63
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:26,769
decomposition in the system a sort of

64
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:31,060
natural steady decomposition in the

65
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:34,959
system that is advantageous to growing a

66
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:37,509
plant and not necessarily a compost site

67
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,759
so I would say that is steered by the

68
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:42,250
amount of organic matter and the

69
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:46,060
combination of organic matter in the

70
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,979
system and on top of the system so first

71
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,079
and foremost if you're growing if you're

72
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:53,500
growing cannabis if you're growing any

73
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:55,750
cash crop right for for money or

74
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,379
whatever you're doing this seriously I I

75
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:02,919
would make sure that your organic matter

76
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:05,079
and your rates of nutrient cycling are

77
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,049
the first and foremost priority of the

78
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,329
system and that requires oxygenation of

79
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,889
the system and that means that the soil

80
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:14,409
you need to understand that the soil

81
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,930
needs to respire and for the soil to

82
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:19,238
respire and Bri that needs to be able to

83
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,709
get access to that air if it's smothered

84
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:24,469
with any thick cake layers of

85
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:27,168
anything whether that be caked on new

86
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,810
minerals that are too much you know

87
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:32,209
anything could be too much you know any

88
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,220
organic material any mineral material

89
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:37,879
can be too much if it's it but smothers

90
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,830
that surface layer even if its roots

91
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,529
growing in the surface layer so you can

92
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:44,959
have you can have a living mulch layer a

93
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:47,568
crop layer that is too much that it's

94
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,948
holding on to so much water that now

95
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,360
you're getting gnats and now you're

96
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,639
getting other things like that that

97
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,848
maybe you don't want to have to deal

98
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,918
with in your system so understanding

99
00:04:55,848 --> 00:05:00,589
that when you're dealing with a living

100
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,500
soil system you want that aerobic

101
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:05,329
respiration in the system so yes you

102
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,009
want organic matter and that can come in

103
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:08,659
the form of roots make sure that they're

104
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,340
not overwhelming your system if you're

105
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,500
getting too many gnats then that down

106
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:14,899
make sure that your mulch layer is

107
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,060
something that is not suffocating the

108
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:19,399
system again if you're having gnats

109
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,348
you're seeing that the your your

110
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:25,549
accumulating water on the system and

111
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:30,288
don't try to emulate necessarily too

112
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:33,560
much of a decomposition in in the soil

113
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:35,598
per se leave that portion for composting

114
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,288
on its on its own off to the side I

115
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:40,610
would I would I would suggest so those

116
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:43,908
are the steps that I would immediately

117
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,530
take is just I get that he it sounds

118
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:47,449
like he's in a colder climate and he's

119
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:49,098
trying to buffer through when he didn't

120
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:52,009
have the plants and that's fine just

121
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:55,490
take off that huge mulch layer when you

122
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:58,069
go to plant the plants and make sure

123
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,530
that your soil can respire that it can

124
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:03,079
breathe that you can kind of see here

125
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:04,638
and there into the soil and see what is

126
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:07,788
going on now if you're in a hot climate

127
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,889
and you want to mitigate water loss you

128
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:12,288
want to make sure that you have enough

129
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:14,990
mulch layer that you do mitigate that

130
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:18,259
that water loss so it's just a

131
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,819
everything is context and a balance but

132
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:23,180
keeping in mind that you want that

133
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:25,519
aerobic microbial life doing those

134
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,348
processes for you that's what gives you

135
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,668
all the nutrients in the form that you

136
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:31,750
want and that's what gives you all the

137
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:33,918
enzymes that's what gives you all of the

138
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,120
hormones and different things like that

139
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,549
that the plant needs

140
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,290
and that's what engages the genetics of

141
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,168
the plant to give it what it needs when

142
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,000
it needs it so I mean microbes aren't

143
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:46,310
perfect you do have to balance that with

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,629
you know your mineral profile too but

145
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,339
anyway I think would work good who's

146
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:55,159
that and iike on decomposition though

147
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:57,799
when if you're laying that much rice

148
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,380
whole into a media and you're not

149
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,790
putting in enough of a nitrogen source

150
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:04,990
in order to go along with it it's

151
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:08,660
effectively drawing as a nutrient sink

152
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:11,210
that also slow down that decomposition

153
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,570
process because it you what's like

154
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:16,579
whenever I've used rice hulls in a mix i

155
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:19,009
compost it first and then add it I don't

156
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:20,659
add it as an aeration component because

157
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,819
for me it's always been a nitrogen thief

158
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,310
that's right so it ends up it ends up

159
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:27,529
stealing my effective nitrogen in order

160
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,620
to break down naturally under microbial

161
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:33,379
level and so he might have had enough to

162
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,199
drive fertility but he's not getting

163
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:39,560
enough of biological activity in the way

164
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,960
he needs to really do composting yeah

165
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,069
and and I'm just curious either from

166
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:46,189
your opinion you know does that make

167
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:47,360
sense yeah a percent yeah which is what

168
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:50,120
I was going to say is that the

169
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,710
conditions are what's important for you

170
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,389
know if there's no water out there

171
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:56,779
there's no organisms doing any

172
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:58,848
decomposition at all because wherever

173
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:01,489
the organisms are whether it's under the

174
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:04,279
snow layer or in the rain forest they

175
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:07,370
need ideal levels of moisture for those

176
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,138
sets of organisms they need organisms

177
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,959
that will operate within those

178
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:13,848
temperatures so if his bed doesn't have

179
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,370
any organisms that are suitable to

180
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:19,579
operating during those extreme cold then

181
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,228
nothing's gonna be happening anyways you

182
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:25,370
know dr. Lane did a bunch of research

183
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:27,680
and her work found that some of the

184
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,538
highest rates of decomposition happened

185
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,549
under the snow layer during the winter

186
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:37,278
and what what she supposes is happening

187
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:40,189
is that where this where the the snow

188
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,929
meets the soil it's not completely

189
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,010
frozen and there's a little free water

190
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:47,519
layer that is the ideal moisture

191
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:50,879
percentage for organisms to perform

192
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,559
decomposition activities and so I would

193
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,990
start to look at the main differences

194
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,359
between his indoor that's having high

195
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,710
rates of decomposition and the outdoor

196
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,840
that's not having high rates of

197
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,330
decomposition I would think one of the

198
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,350
easy components is he's watering the

199
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,639
indoor and he's not watering the outdoor

200
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,320
because he's just letting it try to

201
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,350
decompose so if there's not adequate

202
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,850
moisture in that compost pile so to

203
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,330
speak that nothing's gonna be happening

204
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,370
and then if there's too much of anything

205
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,100
you're suffocating it and again

206
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:27,240
nothing's happening so we need adequate

207
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,730
and ideal aeration and levels of oxygen

208
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,549
for rates of decomposition to happen you

209
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,170
need ideal levers of moisture for that

210
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,029
decomposition to happen because they

211
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:39,209
need to be awake and operating with

212
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:41,159
certain amounts of water and you need

213
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,900
the organisms that will function and

214
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:47,519
operate under those conditions with

215
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:50,730
which they're under and you need you

216
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,100
need that again that that taking a look

217
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,320
at what organisms are there are the

218
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,500
organisms even there to do the

219
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,000
decomposition so you may be asking the

220
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,549
system to do something that it can't

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,940
really do at this stage in its evolution

222
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:07,559
so and he did ask about acceleration

223
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,050
techniques and yeah if you add

224
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,909
supplemental things that can encourage

225
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:14,069
biology which will encourage the in

226
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:17,490
composition one of the things that he

227
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:20,910
mentioned was the sprouted CT which is a

228
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:24,060
very popular thing of all the things

229
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:26,699
that collapse beneficial populations of

230
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,979
organisms in the organic sector out say

231
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,320
the sprouted CTS are the most effective

232
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,539
and they're just as capable at

233
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,090
completely wiping out soil organisms as

234
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:39,569
an application of a systemic fungicide

235
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:41,100
is they have the same amount of about

236
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,379
yeah yeah it's crazy people don't think

237
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,509
about that but an accelerant can also

238
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:47,370
blow the head off yeah so yeah you can

239
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:49,289
start your car with a little shot of

240
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,629
ether into the air cleaner every day but

241
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:54,689
at some point the motors gonna blow up

242
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:56,610
and so you know if you do add anything

243
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,280
to that mulch layer to accelerate

244
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,409
decomposition you have to also factor in

245
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,769
that where most of us are way over

246
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:07,318
applying things which causes a actual

247
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:10,560
destruction of the organism populations

248
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:12,750
through over stimulation so you need to

249
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,599
not collapse it through over stimulation

250
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,578
it's like a boom-bust effect mmm in any

251
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,050
ecological system so like even if you

252
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,729
have too many rabbits and now you're

253
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:23,099
gonna have a big proliferation of

254
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,089
coyotes and whatever eats rabbits and

255
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,129
they're gonna decimate the population

256
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,500
and then you'll have too many of the

257
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:30,149
Predators and that that can go back and

258
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,500
forth and extremes in the microbial

259
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,500
community as well yeah

260
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:38,698
and Skyy you had said something

261
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,909
interesting about what Elaine said about

262
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:44,849
snow and what happens underneath it so

263
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:46,528
he blew is growing in Maine but he's

264
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,480
growing in the greenhouse or the snow

265
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:50,909
there's not a layer of snow but if you

266
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,409
if you didn't have that top can you talk

267
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:55,669
about what would happen with the snow

268
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:58,198
and what goes on underneath well and I'm

269
00:11:55,669 --> 00:12:00,149
yeah I'm not necessarily advocating

270
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:02,338
adding snow either I just met I think

271
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:04,470
what's important is I think what's

272
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:08,399
important is that the snow is providing

273
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,050
the ideal level of moisture on the soil

274
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,448
surface where the decomposition is

275
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:14,490
happening and so if he harvested those

276
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:18,778
plants and never added any more water in

277
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:20,039
there well water oxygen and microbes are

278
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,679
the three things that cause

279
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,688
decomposition to happen so without the

280
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,179
water it's not going to happen without

281
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:31,099
the oxygen it's not gonna happen without

282
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:34,620
the organisms not gonna happen so

283
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,750
whether he adds moisture out there I I

284
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,610
think what he really needs personally is

285
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:43,740
he needs to get a good foundational

286
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:46,079
composting technique to get that aspect

287
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,930
covered to where he is providing benefit

288
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,479
to his farm in the offseason and and

289
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:53,938
just let the soil be soil don't try to

290
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,800
force it into composting because by the

291
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:58,708
time you plant again you might still be

292
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,389
composting like Kevin said you get too

293
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,969
many rice holes your carbon to nitrogen

294
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:04,860
ratios off your composting is gonna be

295
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,949
ineffective and you're gonna have

296
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,019
problems so I would say focus on getting

297
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:12,269
a really healthy worm bin you know you

298
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,490
don't need a ton of compost everybody's

299
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:16,159
after like

300
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,259
mounds and mounds of compost like Sarah

301
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,708
and I take little tiny totes like three

302
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:23,809
cubic feet so two soil bags of compost

303
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:27,259
will treat 40,000 square feet of

304
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:29,509
cannabis like you don't need you know

305
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:32,809
what I mean like been in a Rubbermaid

306
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:35,958
tote that's enough compost to treat

307
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:38,479
40,000 square feet of plants you don't

308
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:42,708
need a massive amount what you need is a

309
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,200
very healthy amount of compost what we

310
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:46,369
call what we're trying to turn

311
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,709
biologically complete so that we did

312
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,778
delineate and differentiate between like

313
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:52,969
municipal compost which is a very

314
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:55,669
different thing than the type of compost

315
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,889
we're talking about so biologically

316
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,389
complete just means it has its inoculum

317
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:01,458
grade it has all of those organisms

318
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:05,949
we're talking about they're doing the

319
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:23,479
job that he's asking the system to do

320
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:23,990
alright do you want to good seeing you

321
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,860
guys

322
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:33,759
yeah you bet and we got Chris trunk next

323
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,759
week so this is jar
