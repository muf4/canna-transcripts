growers insiders guide I'm the publisher

5
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:30,839
Rob Clark's book - hashish and I've been

6
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,299
growing since 1968 for a start of the

7
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:37,500
New York City in the apartment moved to

8
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:40,979
California in 76 and have grown indoors

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,140
outdoors greenhouses a couple of times

10
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:46,979
on some real scale but most the time

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,409
pretty small stuff I still breathe I

12
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,919
still consult I still write they still

13
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:59,339
photograph I recently had this last year

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:01,230
I had to photo art shows one at MMB

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,870
gallery here about tribal marijuana

16
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:07,500
photographs and one in New York City at

17
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,819
Ben Newby gallery that was last fall so

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,478
currently I'm still doing that still

19
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:14,279
breeding and do some consulting

20
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,840
my name is a Cal casting on the founder

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,329
and grower of Palomar crafts cannabis

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,920
been growing in a two-car garage started

23
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,658
growing in a two-car garage back in 2009

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,790
and over the years I've scaled it up to

25
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,040
32,000 square foot to mix light facility

26
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,570
and you know Bill and I are actually

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,820
having some pretty good conversations

28
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:31,919
about the industry and how it's been

29
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,059
changing over the years some of the

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,769
things that we were really talking about

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,969
it was just you know the skill sets that

32
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:38,969
we've developed over the years as

33
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:41,459
growers yes and what the thing we both

34
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:43,969
agree on that that's probably the

35
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:47,669
biggest problem in the cultivation

36
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:50,879
aspect of of the industry is the lack of

37
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,159
true master growers that we just see too

38
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,408
many rows failed because the master

39
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,020
grower really isn't a master at growing

40
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,549
and that's something that should be

41
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:01,319
changing because there's so much money

42
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,930
involved in it so much at stake in it

43
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,718
that I think more and more people who

44
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,500
our growers will take what they're doing

45
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,840
much more seriously in terms

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,139
the science the technology that's

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,270
available now because when you grow

48
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:18,549
indoors or in a greenhouse you need to

49
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,219
control the environment as much as

50
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,530
possible not only and the cleanliness

51
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:26,560
aspect of it but also when in terms of

52
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,939
humidity and of course the co2 your

53
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,550
fertilizers and everything else it all

54
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:33,460
has to be monitored it has to be

55
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,960
monitored consistently in the the grows

56
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,409
that that I've seen that are really

57
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,959
successful are set up in a way that

58
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:43,209
there are remote monitors in every room

59
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,569
that are telling them what their

60
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:49,509
humidity is what the temperature is so

61
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:52,120
that it falls within a bdp range that's

62
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:54,519
healthy for the plants this way here

63
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,550
they you can avoid getting things like

64
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,990
powdery mildew so you never have to

65
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,230
treat the plants with it with something

66
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:07,240
before or after it happens the the days

67
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:10,179
of eagle 20 are gone and so people have

68
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,450
to learn how to grow things grow sit

69
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,700
clean crops without resorting to these

70
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:17,018
things that were used in the past yeah I

71
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:20,229
mean like we were just talking about

72
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:22,000
some horror stories of these like real

73
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:24,819
estate developers new interest into the

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,409
industry coming in hiring some guy from

75
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,299
Colorado says he's a master grower

76
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:31,120
dumping millions of dollars into

77
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,580
facility installing the wrong technology

78
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,800
and just losing everything and we're

79
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,330
seeing that a lot in California over the

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,620
last couple years as legalization has

81
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,180
happened these regulations are been

82
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,030
implemented and it's just really

83
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,489
heartbreaking it's just some of the bad

84
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,959
advice and just wrong advice that

85
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,519
traditional agriculture people are

86
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,039
giving to cannabis growers and saying

87
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,019
you know we would recommend one set of

88
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,280
equipment but say a guy grows tomato or

89
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:56,650
corn would say oh you don't need that

90
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,879
it's like it's a heat tolerant plant how

91
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,379
do you know it's a heat tolerant plant

92
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,479
have any cameras towers have you had

93
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:03,969
right and so it's just a lot of bad

94
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:06,189
advice and there a lot of people are

95
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,560
just not valuing the skill sets that

96
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:11,049
we've developed over the years at great

97
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,449
risk because they just think it's a

98
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,890
plant and it's really it's really

99
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:16,988
heartbreaking to see some of these just

100
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:18,098
like it's very simple mistakes that are

101
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:21,370
costing people millions of millions of

102
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:21,879
dollars also the practice is that that a

103
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,040
lot of

104
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,920
had just aren't accepted in the in the

105
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,629
industry anymore simply because your

106
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,430
product is going to be tested and has to

107
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:33,100
be completely free of pesticides of

108
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,009
fungicides so forth

109
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,500
whereas before it wasn't and so people

110
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:41,019
just used whatever they could to finish

111
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,480
a crop and if they're living in a place

112
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,649
that had a lot of humidity a lot of cool

113
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,080
temperatures they were going to end up

114
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:48,609
with powdery mildew or part Rytas and

115
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,800
that they would treat with fine size and

116
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,389
you just can't do that anymore yeah one

117
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,329
of the products you mentioned Eagle 20

118
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:57,039
that was a very common fungicide to get

119
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,689
rid of powdery mildew or bot or some of

120
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,640
these other things but that shows up on

121
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:02,170
tests now and even when you extract it

122
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,759
that can actually you know pass through

123
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,040
the extraction process and go into your

124
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,230
concentrates plant and people are

125
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,850
struggling with that as well yeah yeah

126
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,910
in fact people who thought they would

127
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:15,640
clean of that because they would use a

128
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,230
clone and a clone that came from the

129
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,479
plant that had been treated the way the

130
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,069
Eagle 20 but it's still it's a systemic

131
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,009
and it would end up and it could still

132
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:28,420
be detectable you know the thing I think

133
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:31,060
that has really hurt the cultivators in

134
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,920
terms of some of these big indoor and

135
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,829
greenhouse growers is when they accept

136
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,689
clones everybody is so interested in

137
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:40,240
getting new genetics better genetics and

138
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:42,370
so forth they accept clones that they

139
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
think are clean and only to find out

140
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,560
that they end up with Russert abroad

141
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,119
mites the mites that are microscopic and

142
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,800
take a long time to discern that you

143
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,680
actually have them until you see your

144
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,790
plants failing so I think that that's

145
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,040
something I've seen in the industry

146
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,650
that's very common somebody brings in a

147
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,600
clone from a trusted source and that

148
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:04,989
trusted source shouldn't have been

149
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,730
trusted as much so something else we

150
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,009
were talking about just as industry is

151
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,660
changing you know you've got indoor

152
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:13,240
cultivation for the first time you can

153
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,960
put up these high-tech greenhouses where

154
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,090
do you think the industry is really

155
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,430
going like as far as the cultivation

156
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:21,009
methods well cultivation I think for

157
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,019
bulk it'll probably be straight outdoors

158
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:24,560
although straight outdoors has its

159
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:26,839
problems too

160
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,310
you know a lot of the the areas that

161
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,579
have been traditionally farm like in

162
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,379
Carpinteria and plays like this you know

163
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:35,959
the soil may have a lot of heavy metals

164
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:39,139
in it it may have you know contaminants

165
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,279
from past growth from years ago that is

166
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,740
still going to be drawing up and they're

167
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,929
going to be detected I tend to agree I

168
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,699
mean you see a lot of bulk coming out of

169
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,579
the North Cal market at the Carpinteria

170
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,289
Santa Barbara look for it's going to be

171
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,240
for extraction right I mean that's a

172
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,580
life in these two hours his extraction

173
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,199
and that has its own set some challenges

174
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:58,370
too with now like if you do have heavy

175
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,079
metals that could pass off but it

176
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,360
concentrates as well yeah it's gotten a

177
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:06,289
lot harder something I've just been

178
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,939
focusing on it's just some of my friends

179
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,170
who are trying to get legal and come to

180
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:11,480
the industry we're trying to help them

181
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,520
do all their paperwork to get them

182
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,810
licensed and everything and because what

183
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,339
they said there's about fifty thousand

184
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,490
growers in the state of California in

185
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:21,079
2017 and now there's like five thousand

186
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,759
so what happens to the other forty five

187
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,930
thousand and they're not gonna close up

188
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,189
shop either they're just pushing

189
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,170
everything out the back door like they

190
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:30,050
always have but that undermines the

191
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,939
whole system yeah you gotta hope to hope

192
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,100
to change that I think it'll be

193
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:37,480
interesting how this all flushes out I

194
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:40,280
think there that there will always be a

195
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,140
craft industry for flowers but flowers

196
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,779
are probably going to become less and

197
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,610
less a part of the of the industry as

198
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,039
more and more goes into the concentrates

199
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,319
I think California will probably be one

200
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,580
of the last places where the use of

201
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:57,769
flowers diminishes because we just have

202
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:59,089
a long history of it and that's that's

203
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,579
the way it's been consumed for so many

204
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:03,739
years I know personally I still like to

205
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:07,550
smoke a good joint one of the best

206
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:09,290
things that dope that and maybe rosin

207
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,848
hit is nicely we'll also get the whole

208
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,050
plant there

209
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:15,978
but I was never big on concentrates I

210
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:19,069
mean other than the fact that they're

211
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:21,288
really strong you know they're just be

212
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,759
missing the whole plant feeling that you

213
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:25,759
get when you have all those different

214
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,408
Europeans in your smoke see that was my

215
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,908
problem with vape pens and everything

216
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:30,259
like that like you know there's some

217
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,610
really good vape pens out there and sure

218
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,680
the flavors are great but it felt like

219
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,509
such a one-dimensional high yeah right I

220
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,370
mean you get you smoke it you get high

221
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:39,288
like really high for like 10 minutes and

222
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,060
then it's gone where someone like the

223
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:43,098
organically grown the son of your own

224
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,899
stuff that I get to smoke every now and

225
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,459
then it's just it's beautiful and your

226
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,589
high for like 2 or 3 hours but you're

227
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:51,859
not overly like oh my god I'm gonna die

228
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:53,750
hi I come yeah that's like I think I

229
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,399
think the extraction still has a ways to

230
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,129
go for in some cases but the rossignol

231
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,049
definitely yes yeah well with the

232
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:03,110
extraction you're you're basically

233
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:04,698
putting in your terpenes that are coming

234
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,669
from other sources right right from

235
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:10,149
lemons your lemonade and so they're just

236
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:13,759
putting it in so when you when you're

237
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:15,318
smoking at in a vape pen you do you get

238
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,230
a strong flavor but it's it's really

239
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:20,838
artificial because they can't put in the

240
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,759
30 or 50 or how many terpenes that are

241
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,160
actually are many of them are there in

242
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,750
miniscule amounts so they put in the

243
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,028
most prominent so there's four or five

244
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,828
of those terpenes they might put in to

245
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:33,338
try to match the terpene profile they

246
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:35,659
get back from a lab all right and it's

247
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,040
you know it works in terms of you get

248
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,750
some flavor but you still don't get the

249
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,000
same effect that you would if you were

250
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,860
smoky the flower came from yeah I agree

251
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,198
I mean it's like once they extract

252
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,199
enough of that matrix that the plant has

253
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:50,448
evolved into it just it cheapens the

254
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:52,969
high I mean we grow one string called

255
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:56,269
Saturn og and like it's really mild but

256
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,069
it'll last for three or four hours and

257
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:59,899
even like you try extracting that like

258
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:01,370
you know with a Pho or even rosin yeah

259
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,870
the rosin actually gets the closest

260
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,519
thing I think they're only yes it really

261
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,250
isn't heat and pressure or that as

262
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,899
opposed to like a solvent and I think

263
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,208
it's just beautiful but you're right

264
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,379
like we're seeing over the years you

265
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,419
know extracts are taking more and more

266
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:16,250
of the shelf space you know for ease of

267
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:17,809
use I mean who doesn't like a big man

268
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,220
right who doesn't like a vape in you can

269
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:19,629
smoke

270
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,820
bar and things like that and I think

271
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:23,740
they're cool but if you really want to

272
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,050
taste the plants in them the craft that

273
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,490
went into it I mean yeah the whole

274
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:30,009
flower I think that it's the way to go

275
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,690
so you think but uh over time less and

276
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:33,850
less flower will actually be consumed

277
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,830
yeah I think it'll always be that craft

278
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,750
industry just like beer you know yeah

279
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:40,120
Budweiser they need also it's a little

280
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,279
craft ones local ones you know it's

281
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,730
funny you mentioned the how long it

282
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:50,019
lasted and back in the day in the 70s

283
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:51,789
when I was breeding I did I produced

284
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,970
Afghani one and Durbin poison for the

285
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:56,620
industry it was one of my claims to fame

286
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,180
is I would give up nimble joints to

287
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,350
people to smoke and have them report

288
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:02,439
back to me and one of the things I

289
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,450
always told I always try to you know do

290
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,950
your comparisons at the same time like

291
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,590
if you smoke at night eight o'clock at

292
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,410
night always do it at that time and then

293
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,970
tell me how long it lasts because how

294
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:16,230
long it lasted to me was the best

295
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,230
indication of how strong it was

296
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:24,360
he's probably strong the Saturn og that

297
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,360
I have was an Afghani cross so thank you

298
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,250
but yeah so some of the things we were

299
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:31,929
talking about - it's just all these new

300
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,309
inches to the market one of the first

301
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,689
panels was talking about the mergers and

302
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:37,059
acquisitions there's a lot of money

303
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,860
coming in as someone who pioneered the

304
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:41,859
industry how does it make you feel like

305
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,930
you've got these guys who two years into

306
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,519
the industry and all of a sudden of

307
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:46,870
these multi-million dollar valuations

308
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,919
and it's like I don't know about you

309
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,889
that that kind of pisses me off

310
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:53,799
well it does me too I mean see people

311
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:55,509
come in who have money and are able to

312
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,919
make more money because they have money

313
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:57,399
they don't have a skill set or anything

314
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,459
else

315
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:02,889
but that's that's unfortunately that's

316
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,060
the way capitalism works you know like I

317
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,970
love it I guess all right

318
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:09,699
fortunately we all can still grow our

319
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,440
own marijuana and I think you know seeds

320
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,610
that will always be part of the industry

321
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,880
of what hasn't been adopted here is

322
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:20,620
really the Arnold flowers like they are

323
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,409
in Europe it's it's the biggest seller

324
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,360
in Europe by the

325
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:27,620
Otto flowers that and then feminized

326
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,028
seeds but here is like I'll be honest

327
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,028
I've been growing for 10 years and I've

328
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:33,409
never grown Otto flower I mean it's it

329
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:35,389
didn't really fit into my kind of

330
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:37,669
production system I guess right but I

331
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:39,110
mean it's as far as California goes in

332
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:40,909
Southern California cultivation guys

333
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,159
it's like we just don't do them but why

334
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:45,169
what do you think that is well for one

335
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,059
thing we don't worry about the the

336
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:49,039
length of the season as much as they do

337
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:51,289
in other parts of the country you know I

338
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,299
can I can still grow like Columbian in

339
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:55,039
my backyard here in Los Angeles really

340
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:58,399
well most of the country you can't do

341
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:02,559
that only because it still is still

342
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,698
flowering in november/december the I

343
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,250
Arnold flowers I mean I don't have much

344
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:09,318
experience with them I I did grow or no

345
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,089
flower because I wanted to learn a

346
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:14,688
little bit about its genetics and and

347
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:17,839
what I did I crossed it with with a male

348
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:21,198
auto flower with six different varieties

349
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,930
that I had then I knew how strong they

350
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:26,359
were no I tested the one that I had

351
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:29,599
tested was a Pakistani that had tested

352
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,028
and about seventeen percent THC and when

353
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,740
I crossed it with the Arnold flower and

354
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:36,078
I had it tested it came up to eight and

355
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,480
a half percent THC exactly one-half of

356
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,859
what the original was and that's because

357
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,720
the are dough flour doesn't get

358
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,480
triggered anything to it all right he's

359
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:49,850
at least the auto flower I so it only

360
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:52,159
had one THC synthase versus the two it

361
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,600
had when it was a Pakistani so that's

362
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,000
how it came out to Apple or turquoise

363
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,939
now it may have been a coincidence but

364
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,799
it seemed to make sense to me another

365
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,568
reason why we never just got into them -

366
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,938
I'm in Southern California

367
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:07,338
everything's indoors right the bulk of

368
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:08,870
my career was all indoor cultivation ok

369
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:10,790
only when it was like fully legalized

370
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,230
into prop 64 it's like okay I'll drop a

371
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:14,419
few million dollars at actually building

372
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,308
a real facility with sensors and right

373
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:18,198
I mean prior to that I had my metric

374
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:20,688
where it's like okay I'd have to spend

375
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:23,179
$3,000 to life right and that's for all

376
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:24,259
my ACS my lights the rent until units

377
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:26,568
are first harvest you had to do as

378
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:28,009
cheaply as possible so you could make

379
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:29,778
all your money back in about six months

380
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,740
because six months is about the average

381
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:32,830
length of time that a police

382
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,120
investigation takes before they rage

383
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,950
that's kind of how I used to set up all

384
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,360
my old ignore grows but now for the

385
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,560
first time ever I mean you know we're

386
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,149
all licensed and permitted and

387
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,069
everything that's like okay wait we can

388
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:43,870
actually you know we we haven't return

389
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,310
on investment we can actually you know

390
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,080
kind of forecast and it's like we're

391
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:48,759
gonna put these really high-tech sensors

392
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,790
and data logging things and relax

393
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,100
sensors for the for the first time ever

394
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:55,719
because we're not worried about getting

395
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,399
the door kick down in six months right

396
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,009
so that's been really exciting for me

397
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,259
personally you know as I started in my

398
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:03,639
garage and always wondering if I'm gonna

399
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:05,429
get my door kicked down which we have

400
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:08,649
and that was fun

401
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:10,149
yeah 13,000 square foot indoor space you

402
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:11,980
know go on and it's about a span of

403
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:14,649
eight hours like two years in there so

404
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,940
but now you finally can and I think

405
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:18,039
that's like gonna be great for our

406
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,050
industry too as we're you know I think

407
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:21,969
the indoor cultivation definitely has a

408
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,740
place in the market for small craft

409
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,290
producers and I've seen like just

410
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,600
amazing flower grown by you know really

411
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:30,819
really high skill set of guys but I

412
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,909
think it's gonna be important too for

413
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,870
just environmental regulatory purposes

414
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:37,028
mix like greenhouses are gonna be a big

415
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,019
thing with all the new carbon taxes that

416
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:41,078
they're starting to hit out the indoor

417
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:43,149
guys I agree I mean the the idea of

418
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:46,179
using all artificial light to grow your

419
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:49,990
plants is just such an expense so it

420
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:52,359
really is a lot of wattage the word a

421
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,919
problem indoors is not not really a

422
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,839
problem you should be able to recycle

423
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,000
almost all of your water and that's no

424
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,459
problem you just collected off your rage

425
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,110
facts argue team dehumidifiers and

426
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:04,599
there's nowhere to go you're in sealed

427
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,129
system yeah I think there's a lot of

428
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,810
misinformation out on the cultivation

429
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,610
side especially with the cities in the

430
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:11,049
state you remember a few years ago when

431
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,370
we're in that drought it's like all the

432
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:14,199
our news articles were saying like oh

433
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,089
it's it takes six gallons a plant you

434
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,800
know everyday for a notice and say no it

435
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,990
doesn't but that's caused a string of

436
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:21,250
problems with the regulatory agencies in

437
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,560
the cities and say well you have to

438
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,448
recollection reuse all your water it's

439
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:27,219
like okay so I'm gonna save about you

440
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:29,049
know five percent of my water usage but

441
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,060
I'm gonna up my filter usage by about a

442
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:32,289
hundred times I'm gonna save a bunch of

443
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,000
water but it would generate a ton of

444
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:35,620
waste with all the filters that word

445
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,028
like because I'm using to recapture all

446
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,009
this water that you're you know so

447
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:40,600
worried about so getting them to

448
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:42,590
understand all that has been really a

449
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,580
challenge for for me and and

450
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,019
as we've been working through all these

451
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,780
regulations that seem to change a tad

452
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:50,539
I'm right in the middle of things

453
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:52,220
Oh now does that make you feel like now

454
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:54,139
you're coming from you know your first

455
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,759
book was published in 74 you know here

456
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:58,759
we are in 2019 do you ever think this

457
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:02,330
would actually happen actually in the

458
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:08,259
70s I thought it would be legal by 1980

459
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:12,160
really well the problem you see you had

460
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:14,509
most that most the more enlightened

461
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,070
municipalities estates were starting to

462
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:19,309
decriminalize it all right make the

463
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:21,500
penalties a lot less and you you had

464
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:25,940
Carter in the White House who seemed

465
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:29,029
sympathetic he also had the first US

466
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:31,690
report come out our recent report the

467
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:33,410
Saffir Commission and they basically

468
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,539
recommended that it be decriminalized

469
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,540
they said that criminalizing it caused

470
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:41,420
more more harm than good

471
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:43,039
unfortunately Nixon said fu and just

472
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,230
throughout that paid no attention to it

473
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,680
and created the DEA it was really what

474
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,839
happened and when I was really 19 by

475
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,180
1980 you had Rockefeller come in with

476
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:57,459
determinate sentences on drugs which

477
00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:01,060
changed everything and you know and

478
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:03,860
Reagan came in and then you start to had

479
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:06,980
programs like camp mm-hmm that was a

480
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:08,899
California program helicopters flying

481
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,819
over the countryside to find marijuana

482
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,130
and that's when indoor cultivation

483
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:15,409
really started that's it really started

484
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,690
push the indoor cultivation absolutely

485
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:21,440
and then you also had an operation green

486
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:23,480
merchant in the 80s which that started

487
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,950
the whole round of them just coming and

488
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,610
not arresting you but just taking all

489
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:31,750
your shit I've been there it was

490
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:34,399
sometimes it was some tough times that I

491
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:37,670
think we should mention something about

492
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:42,470
our experiences with lights these people

493
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,910
want to grow their own own pot you know

494
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,799
my experience is you can grow with

495
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,970
pretty much any light and some lights

496
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:51,230
are better than other lights and the

497
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:53,929
more recent ones like the ceramics I've

498
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:56,210
grown with a little 315 ceramic and it

499
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:57,649
amazing how much you can get from that

500
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,659
one little light and he was saying that

501
00:18:57,648 --> 00:19:01,819
you're trying some 600 oh yeah so

502
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:04,009
light-emitting ceramics is a new thing I

503
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:07,038
mean everyone knows about the LEDs the

504
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,839
light-emitting diodes as a guy who loves

505
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,278
doing R&amp;D projects and side-by-sides

506
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:11,898
with it it's like never really got the

507
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:13,609
LEDs to work especially in flowering

508
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:17,418
okay but the light-emitting ceramics

509
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:19,699
like for veg absolutely 100% embrace

510
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:22,309
that technology I mean we were using 600

511
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,230
watts metal halides which wiped them out

512
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:26,240
you know one for one with a 315 watt

513
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,778
those lightning ceramics and it's great

514
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,638
actually work to be better so I'm hoping

515
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:33,859
here some of the technology will catch

516
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:36,168
up where indoor cultivation yeah

517
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:38,089
actually could be you know economically

518
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:39,679
viable for a lot of guys because in

519
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:41,359
other states too they don't they're only

520
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,769
allowing that I think Massachusetts is

521
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,538
like like that

522
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:46,878
it's an extent where the most the

523
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:47,839
cultivation is all indoor and it was

524
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:49,099
probably not that good from the

525
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,278
environment we use about a hundred Watts

526
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:54,048
a square foot but I think some of the

527
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:55,730
LED stuff and the lacs could help get

528
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:58,220
there but yeah at the end of the day I

529
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,749
think the big production is gonna be

530
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,339
into you know mix like greenhouses like

531
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:02,868
mine and people are gonna be more and

532
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:04,609
more comfortable and investing in that

533
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,319
infrastructure especially as you scale

534
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:07,638
up you have to invest more per square

535
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,859
foot in that infrastructure to actually

536
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:11,269
keep you climatized and you know what we

537
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:12,888
talked about earlier it's just like you

538
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:16,579
have to have a stable climate first yes

539
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:19,308
right yeah I think I think the LEDs will

540
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:20,898
be a big part of the industry even even

541
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:28,069
in flowering and you actually got them

542
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:29,839
to work right up in the greenhouses with

543
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:31,700
supplemental lighting I think I are

544
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:35,749
really where it's going to be in terms

545
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,759
of in terms of the industry because if

546
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:39,829
you have a greenhouse and just rely on

547
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,038
your natural crop you're getting one

548
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:45,678
crop maybe two crops but you can push it

549
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,990
you know and get me three to five crops

550
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,190
a year easy and a greenhouse if you have

551
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,519
supplemental lightening and darkening

552
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,470
right yeah that's basically what you

553
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,329
guys yeah I mean pretty much I mean you

554
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,710
know what people and this kind of goes

555
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:59,418
back to earlier conversation of these

556
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,399
master growers I mean you need to design

557
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:02,640
a cultivation system first and then you

558
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:04,709
design your facility around that

559
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,360
we grow an organic soil and we have a

560
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,860
four week veg time you know two weeks in

561
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,089
a one gallon two weeks in a five you

562
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:11,759
know eight to nine weeks and flowering

563
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:13,619
you know give or take and you know we

564
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,529
have four-part compartmentalized

565
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:18,779
flowering zones and we get five harvests

566
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:20,579
a year per zone so for us we're gonna

567
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,470
get about 20 harvests this year about

568
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,928
every 18 days or so just like clockwork

569
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,819
so and that's hard for a lot of guys

570
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:28,590
understanding a project management and

571
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:30,720
scheduling I think so you have to sync

572
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:32,789
that with your your drying and your and

573
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,529
your manicuring and all that so all has

574
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:36,690
to be figured out in terms that timing

575
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:38,220
right otherwise you're gonna be really

576
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,840
unbalanced I mean I can't tell you a

577
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,759
main reason why a lot of these guys are

578
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,168
failing right now is one because you

579
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,000
know they hire someone from whoever

580
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:46,530
Colorado and there's a master grower and

581
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,240
they put together a system they think

582
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:49,500
works and once they actually start

583
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,700
really running the thing it's like oh

584
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,230
crap our drying rooms not big enough

585
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,150
well now we've got to do that we gotta

586
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,890
pull permits and do this fix this and

587
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,690
run electricity and it's like oh crap

588
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,130
this isn't big enough or this is too big

589
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,019
so now we have a lot of wasted space

590
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,580
where you could have thousands of square

591
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,109
feet just lying fallow and it's like

592
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:05,639
well that's not making any money for you

593
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:07,139
and now you've got to pay the taxes on

594
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,910
that because that's how much square

595
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,070
footage of canopy that you have and that

596
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,900
city's gonna want your tax money right I

597
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:14,579
think that's a really big problem is

598
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,259
people don't understand that they just

599
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:18,119
go in the acquire land they build a

600
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:20,160
facility and then they try to shove a

601
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:22,649
cultivation system into that yeah and

602
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,179
now it's really unbalanced and so and

603
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,548
that's just leads to a lot of losses and

604
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:28,580
you know decreases and efficiencies and

605
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:31,500
yeah like I think we've seen it both

606
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:32,639
since like a lot of problems with guys

607
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,539
who don't understand that and don't

608
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,980
value those skills I mean yeah I've had

609
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,269
guys tell me we're really willing to

610
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,410
write me a check like well your skills

611
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:42,589
doesn't really matter like we'll just

612
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,610
get some Dutch guy in there it's like no

613
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:47,399
absolutely yeah so that's really

614
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:49,168
disheartening but it's and but then it's

615
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,910
been all always in the ends like those

616
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,590
guys are failing right now so you know

617
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,929
mentioning the Dutch just to remind me

618
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:56,970
of something funny is is this is a this

619
00:22:54,929 --> 00:23:02,548
is just maybe about eight months ago I

620
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:05,490
got a DM through my Instagram know from

621
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:09,029
a guy in in the Netherlands in Amsterdam

622
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:10,329
actually and he asked me if I knew

623
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:12,700
anybody anybody

624
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:14,379
we were willing to come dance today I'm

625
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,960
an in girl for him he had the facility

626
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,539
in I groped back saying what do you mean

627
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,159
you're in the up studio like tons of

628
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:29,710
them said no they all went back to

629
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:30,419
California have any questions or

630
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,649
anything

631
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,929
cultivation questions licensing

632
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:37,298
questions sure the question was about

633
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:38,830
automation increasing efficiencies

634
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:40,599
through robotics and reducing your labor

635
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:43,178
costs and yeah I think that's really

636
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,589
important I mean as we get taxed more

637
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:47,080
and heavily more regulated and things

638
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,819
like that we're looking like guys like

639
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,460
us are looking for any way to reduce

640
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:53,079
those costs when you're at scale I mean

641
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,460
for us right now our biggest cost is

642
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:55,689
labor it counts about four fifty five

643
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,778
percent of the cost to produce one pound

644
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:02,590
or one plant plant whatever you want to

645
00:23:58,778 --> 00:24:04,359
call it and especially depending on wets

646
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:05,829
you know state or municipality or and

647
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,599
there could be a lot of labor shortages

648
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:08,949
and things like that so I mean I'm out

649
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,449
in the middle of nowhere right now and

650
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,980
the staffing can be a challenge so it'd

651
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,630
be great if I could have some more

652
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,250
automation and so but we're definitely

653
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,919
putting a lot of that stuff in place

654
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,990
we're looking to big AG for some of

655
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,090
their technology like moving benches is

656
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,380
one the Dutch I know that guys yeah the

657
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:25,538
sliding benches we've got rolling

658
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,340
benches that go side to side but now I

659
00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:28,569
need a bench that goes front to back cuz

660
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:30,250
my greenhouse is about a hundred feet

661
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:31,629
long that's a heck of a trek when you're

662
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,470
like trying to move plants up and down

663
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:37,690
it ever all day so yeah and II use

664
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,339
automatic trimming we do a little joint

665
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,669
running well because that kind of goes

666
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:44,230
back to a balanced system to you know if

667
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:45,730
we have I got twenty thousand square

668
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,589
feet of canopy you know for harvesting

669
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:51,190
about a little over 2,000 plants every

670
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:52,148
eighteen days and with that kind of and

671
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,798
even there's still a degree of

672
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:55,989
seasonality in our greenhouses to I mean

673
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:57,579
the sun's really weak right now so you

674
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,589
know we need int we need staff up and

675
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:02,528
staff down throughout the season but if

676
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:04,538
we were to hand trim everything we would

677
00:25:02,528 --> 00:25:06,369
need seventy full-time trimmers and what

678
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:08,619
happens if I'm two days you know ahead

679
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:10,569
of schedule and I've got 70 trimmers

680
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:12,969
like hey like sorry gonna take the next

681
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:15,579
couple days off right piss them off yeah

682
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,929
so we use a light a little bit of

683
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:18,250
automation when it comes to our trimming

684
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:19,280
to have about a full-time workforce

685
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,160
about 20

686
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,019
time guys but I mean they get better at

687
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,640
their job I'm able to cross train them

688
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:28,000
so now they also know a little about

689
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,320
trimming about processing the packaging

690
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,690
cultivation and they light that and so a

691
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,889
lot of my entry-level guys and some of

692
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,750
the guys were kind of new they get to

693
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,280
see every part of the company because we

694
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,509
can move them around because we are

695
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,670
using some of that automation so the

696
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:41,960
more bought in you know we could to see

697
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,720
who's gonna be a good performer instead

698
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,730
of just having a headcount of like 50 70

699
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,319
people and that's all they're doing and

700
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,089
so we are able to reduce our turnover

701
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,049
rate because of that as well yeah just

702
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:52,909
by implementing some of those

703
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,829
automations and I think that's important

704
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:58,400
if you're not if and I think a lot of

705
00:25:54,829 --> 00:26:00,379
our peers in the industry are still kind

706
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,880
of stuck in that mindset of well this is

707
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,230
how it's done for 20 years we have to

708
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,510
hand trim it we're gonna do this gonna

709
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,190
hand water it and it's like yeah that

710
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:08,960
works great at a craft level if they

711
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,640
want to stay so we're explain it's

712
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,079
illegal I'll see ya exactly when you

713
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,790
don't have to pay payroll taxes on

714
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,000
workers comp well that's other great

715
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:19,460
stuff but it's in it definitely has to

716
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,809
be a part of the new world that we gonna

717
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,880
regulate at world that were you live in

718
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:24,589
because those are just sacrifices you

719
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,120
have to make to not get your door kicked

720
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:27,740
down or guys drop in from Blackhawk

721
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:29,000
helicopters on your head right like

722
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,430
these are just things that we're all

723
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,869
gonna have to accept and I know we've

724
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,400
embraced a lot of that stuff because

725
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:35,419
we're not trying to get rid of jobs

726
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,610
we're trying to make the jobs we get

727
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,019
better yeah and I want to pay the one

728
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:41,209
guy who's running those were you know

729
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:42,529
systems a lot more money I want to give

730
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,329
him more opportunities because we can

731
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:47,420
expand the company that way instead of

732
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:49,639
having you know a dozens of minimum wage

733
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,750
employees let's have a bunch of salaried

734
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,430
guys are actually making money good

735
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,509
benefits and that's for my company

736
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,710
that's really important I mean there's

737
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:56,059
only two things in my company it's

738
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,160
people and plants that's it

739
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:59,960
yeah you have good people they grow good

740
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,610
plants or plants produce good weed sell

741
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,549
some good make good money right back

742
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:06,919
into the people that's it so yeah we do

743
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:08,629
use a lot of that stuff just to balance

744
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,110
the system and make it better jobs for

745
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,110
everybody yeah

746
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,250
we're really excited about the s like a

747
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,840
fertigation system called rhythm that

748
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,420
we're just having installed and so that

749
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,709
can really just dial in some of our

750
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,410
systems further it's like we can

751
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,910
actually see like how dry the plant is

752
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,710
and what that time like okay here's when

753
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:38,019
I watered first this is my dry vac time

754
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:40,059
and the system will know exactly based

755
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:41,650
on the parameters we set in it when to

756
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:43,179
water it again and some other data that

757
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,650
we collect okay what's that runoff look

758
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,539
like once the tissue analysis the plant

759
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,600
looked like what's the soil holding

760
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:52,029
what's still inside there so we can kind

761
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,649
of go back in program and dial in these

762
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:55,569
strains even further so like we've

763
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,980
developed a regimented system where you

764
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:59,470
know we know the genetics of the strains

765
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,329
you know like my Saturn og is an Afghani

766
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,850
cross and so you know I want to borrow

767
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:05,829
that right and we can actually optimize

768
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,539
the system faster because we have that

769
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:09,490
good data set of collection we know it's

770
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:11,440
like okay this Afghani likes this kind

771
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,900
of this kind of fertilizer blend or this

772
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,039
little bit of soil difference and if we

773
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,480
find another strain that might have

774
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,579
another Afghani cross it's like okay

775
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,589
well we've already got a baseline for

776
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:22,119
that genetic so we can optimize it

777
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:24,669
faster by doing that but I'm really

778
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:26,379
excited about that you know the

779
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,910
environmental control systems like link

780
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:31,540
4 we're working with them pretty closely

781
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:32,380
it's like I love I have a I love it and

782
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:34,509
I hate it when some of these companies

783
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,850
say no one's ever asked us that before

784
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:38,890
and so that must be I have a new idea

785
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,969
that's must be cool I might be cool but

786
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,310
then it's a pain in the ass actually

787
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,960
implemented so so I'm really excited

788
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:45,190
with kind of the data collection and now

789
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,769
we've we've hooked up a lot of those

790
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,779
servers and sensors to a sequel server

791
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:51,220
database and we can actually pull all

792
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:52,450
the data out of that and mash it up with

793
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,690
like these data visualization software

794
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:59,650
you know I think the the the thrust of

795
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:01,390
it is is data is that collecting more

796
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:03,460
and more data about how much what are

797
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:06,550
they using and and so forth and really

798
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,860
getting it down to a very fine art you

799
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:11,289
know it's really when you get the most

800
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:13,839
production right the cleanest production

801
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:17,259
also and it's it's repeatability too I

802
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:19,720
think that's yeah the question was are

803
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:21,369
we using data to daydream decisions on

804
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,919
what strains to grow during what seasons

805
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:24,959
and I'm also do

806
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,190
breeding we're not doing breeding

807
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,019
anymore because of an accident I had

808
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,230
years ago where I seated you know 20

809
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:32,249
lights worth of plants so no breeding on

810
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,259
the side I think there's a lot of

811
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:36,269
amazing breeders in the United States

812
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:37,710
right now and in California that's

813
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:39,509
something though that's it that is a

814
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,989
good point in terms of at different

815
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:44,819
times of the year different different

816
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:47,399
cultivars will respond better or worse

817
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:52,339
you know like you might be looking at a

818
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:55,108
shorty season one for for a winter crop

819
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:57,058
yeah for us I mean we really cut back

820
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:59,519
our production of certain sativas yeah

821
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:01,108
because sativas they typically like much

822
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,669
much more light I mean sativas evolved

823
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:06,449
around the equator they have a longer

824
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:08,278
flowering period and also the Southern

825
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,960
California market doesn't really like a

826
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:12,989
lot of sativas in the wintertime anyways

827
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,460
I mean right now like if I had you know

828
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:17,308
ten pounds of uh sativa I couldn't sell

829
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,379
to save my life but as the summer months

830
00:30:17,308 --> 00:30:21,599
come in they become much more popular

831
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:23,038
and so we're using data it's just you

832
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,748
know what's the market demand and also

833
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:26,878
what our environment allows us to grow

834
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:28,679
at the most efficiently because if you

835
00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:30,509
have a sativa that wants a lot of light

836
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,070
and right now our light is so weak it's

837
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:33,899
about you know seventy percent weaker

838
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:35,249
than it is at the peak of summertime you

839
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,418
just won't get the yield out of that but

840
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:38,429
you're still using the same amount of

841
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,619
you know fertilizers nutrients oils

842
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:42,869
labor to actually still produce that so

843
00:30:40,618 --> 00:30:44,249
your cost to produce a gram of a sativa

844
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,988
flower in winter time is much much

845
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:48,808
higher than a comparable indica so

846
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:51,899
absolutely we use that like 50 percent

847
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:53,220
yeah I mean these the sativas like the

848
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:55,528
question was how much higher it's about

849
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,509
50% higher these things like a lot of

850
00:30:55,528 --> 00:30:59,308
light to get that kind of you know I

851
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:02,579
mean blue dream right

852
00:30:59,308 --> 00:31:05,579
classic sativa loves a lot of like great

853
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:07,439
yield er but like I've seen guys who

854
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:08,999
just grow beautiful blue dream but only

855
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,980
under very specific conditions and one

856
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:14,819
of those is ate a lot of lights no I

857
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:17,249
mean the pure sativa is like here in Los

858
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:20,999
Angeles they'll still be good going in

859
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:24,509
November and December until attention

860
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:27,000
harvest same when I was in Oakland I can

861
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:30,390
remember growing Thai and

862
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,240
actually as the old days days to still

863
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:35,850
be going gangbusters in December you

864
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,009
know slowly that shouldn't say

865
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:40,139
gangbusters cuz it all slows down

866
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:42,720
because the the level of light is just

867
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:46,290
diminishing both in intensity and direct

868
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,579
duration question was we've been talking

869
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:49,319
to other cultivators with alternative

870
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:51,149
methods of farming so dry farming

871
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:54,599
no-till farming then those are very

872
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:56,250
classic styles of Agriculture no no dry

873
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,439
farming is when there's no irrigation

874
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,880
right I mean that's still done a lot in

875
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,380
Southern California with certain berries

876
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,510
crops and things like that but yeah and

877
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,640
as far as cannabis what do you think

878
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:08,099
also the note the no-till was also

879
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:12,000
something that people have done for I

880
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:15,509
don't know centuries maybe no I haven't

881
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,299
seen these though I am seeing these you

882
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:20,250
know I basically haven't seen just

883
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,779
standard growing and I mean I've seen in

884
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,299
both ways I've seen with parameterised

885
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:25,769
seeds I've seen it with you know just

886
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:30,359
going in there and getting the males out

887
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:33,059
before they flower spacing all different

888
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:36,079
depends on what they think the size of

889
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:38,609
the plant they expect to get out of it

890
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,769
and you know it's going to be all

891
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:44,729
different ways it's it's again it'll

892
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:46,950
come down to the person's own personal

893
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:49,019
data their database whether it's in

894
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:51,150
their mind or as they actually logged

895
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:53,789
right in of what works best for them

896
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,830
right you know I've seen people when it

897
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:57,569
was illegal growing plants very close

898
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:59,849
together and try to get a lot of plants

899
00:32:57,569 --> 00:33:03,049
another want to grow many fewer plants

900
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:05,459
but much much larger plant plants so

901
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:07,950
this will start to flush out is

902
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,809
different people because whether you're

903
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,799
profitable or not is good what's gonna

904
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:15,480
determine how long you last so yeah and

905
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,180
for me I mean so you talked about you

906
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,319
know dry farming you know I haven't seen

907
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,880
it done with cannabis I've seen it done

908
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:23,159
with dozens of other crops but does it

909
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,640
actually add value to the market not

910
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,680
really

911
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,230
yeah I mean I think in our you know

912
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,779
dynamic market the market will you know

913
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:32,220
we'll make those decisions I mean one of

914
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:34,500
the things I've seen is just the hint

915
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,360
rimming aspect while I still think

916
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,799
that's the absolute best one I mean I've

917
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,508
done it probably a dozen times over the

918
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:42,308
last 12 months where we had one

919
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:43,598
pounds of a strain and half of it was

920
00:33:42,308 --> 00:33:45,519
hand trimmed the other half was a light

921
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:48,249
machine trimmed on it I couldn't get a

922
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,868
dollar more for the hand trim stuff sure

923
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:51,308
it looked better but it only looked

924
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:52,569
marginally better and while that

925
00:33:51,308 --> 00:33:58,328
increased our labor cost substantially

926
00:33:52,569 --> 00:34:00,848
to produce those pounds ya know the

927
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:03,519
aesthetics did not add a perceived

928
00:34:00,848 --> 00:34:05,019
amount of value to actually recoup the

929
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,138
cost of actually generating that

930
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:10,148
perceived value if that makes sense

931
00:34:07,138 --> 00:34:11,558
because it's just a very dynamic market

932
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,969
right now and there's a seasonality to

933
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:14,769
it right like right now we're in the

934
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:16,750
middle of February things are a bit slow

935
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:18,038
right sales goes but as soon as people

936
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,588
get their tax returns man

937
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:22,778
our sales go right back up maybe not so

938
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:24,788
much this year yeah maybe yeah so that's

939
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:28,268
a whole nother discussion like that one

940
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:30,399
but as far as you know no-till farming

941
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:32,288
we use a method of that and no-till

942
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,418
farming is meant to you know increase

943
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:36,278
the microbial density in the soil right

944
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:40,719
it's meant to and that's really

945
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:42,398
important for accurate soil food web we

946
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,868
use a modified version of that and I

947
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,509
think that's important because I think

948
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:48,548
for our style of cultivation that really

949
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:51,878
increases the quality of the plant like

950
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:54,909
you know we use mostly organics and with

951
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:56,980
organics it's like painting with a room

952
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,990
for the very large palette of colors the

953
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,639
plant can absorb you know multiple

954
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:02,858
sources of nitrogen from you know

955
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,838
guano's and different meals and things

956
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:06,578
like that whereas if you're using you

957
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:08,679
know nitrates or synthetic fertilizers

958
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:10,089
the plants only able absorb from one

959
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:12,639
source of that product it can only

960
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:14,318
absorb like so much but if you have 12

961
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,659
different sources of them or whatever

962
00:35:14,318 --> 00:35:17,858
you know input you're having then it

963
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:19,118
could actually take all that all and

964
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:22,028
metabolize it and get a little better

965
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,890
yield out of that so yes that no-till

966
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:25,268
method does have benefits but you have

967
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:27,909
to understand how it works and work

968
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:29,469
within your cultivation system I mean

969
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:31,629
I've seen a lot of guys like you know

970
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:33,909
the raised planter beds have you ever

971
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,329
seen that work at scale no yeah me

972
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:36,308
neither

973
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:37,750
right because I mean like just so you

974
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:40,269
know raised planter beds they're you

975
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,829
know just tall boxes of soil that's

976
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:44,798
living and you don't typically replace

977
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:46,480
that soil every harvest you're you're

978
00:35:44,798 --> 00:35:48,159
always we're using the same soil over

979
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,469
and over again but what I've seen happen

980
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,509
at scale if one thing goes wrong with

981
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:53,769
that soil like rude aphids

982
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,750
now you're screwed because you're

983
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:58,389
dependent upon that soil having that

984
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:00,130
certain kind of nutritional microbial

985
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:02,170
mix to give the plant what it needs when

986
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,700
it needs it but then if something goes

987
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,440
wrong if you got 10,000 square feet of

988
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:08,589
greenhouse yeah you're gonna have a lot

989
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,150
of problems with that so again it has a

990
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,940
place but you have to know where to put

991
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:17,019
it yeah the whole thing with growing

992
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,970
outdoors is it's like any farming you

993
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:20,289
know it's you're gonna have your good

994
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:22,179
days and your bad days and your good

995
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:23,380
crops and your bad crops now I'd be

996
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:26,649
terrified not growing outdoors you know

997
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:29,440
growing outdoors here you know just my

998
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:33,639
experience with growing at my own place

999
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,530
is just the bug worms are devastating

1000
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:37,868
right which means you you and a half

1001
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,760
just either you're gonna have to net the

1002
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:41,829
entire crop or you're gonna have to do

1003
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,440
beat either the entire crop right and

1004
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:45,789
the BT works wonders it works great if

1005
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,510
you're consistent with it it works

1006
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:50,559
perfectly right but yeah a lot of people

1007
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,640
just think they're gonna put the seeds

1008
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:53,170
in the ground they're gonna order them

1009
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:55,118
they're gonna pull it out and know what

1010
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,320
they're gonna have all those kinds of

1011
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,750
problems you have when you're a farmer

1012
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,990
and the additional problem is that your

1013
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:05,800
stuff is going to be really scrutinized

1014
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:06,939
in terms of how clean it is so there's a

1015
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,390
lot of new entrants coming to the market

1016
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,530
like a lot of big money guys big players

1017
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:13,358
kind of advice do you have for these

1018
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,470
guys or ready to drop millions of

1019
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,329
dollars in this industry when they've

1020
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:17,829
never grown a plan or you know never

1021
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:21,429
sold a but in their life find three old

1022
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:24,309
master growers first agreed good design

1023
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:25,868
teams to design them sewing but how

1024
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:27,849
would you have like how would you even

1025
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,990
know one I mean like so this is the kind

1026
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:31,900
of a question I get all the time well

1027
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:33,459
what makes a good master grower I I

1028
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,809
think I'm a master grower because I've

1029
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,250
earned it I mean I've been doing this

1030
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:38,349
for ten years and I've had a lot of

1031
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,719
successes and and I've develop a style

1032
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:42,789
of cultivation that I think adds a lot

1033
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,039
of high quality and consistency but I

1034
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:46,659
don't really know like what to tell

1035
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,789
someone and how to identify some of

1036
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:50,049
those traits I mean let's say like you

1037
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:51,579
know we got a millionaire over here

1038
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,440
and he's about to you know build a green

1039
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:55,289
massive green house but how does how is

1040
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,179
he supposed to hire that master grower

1041
00:37:55,289 --> 00:38:00,250
well if I was that millionaire I would I

1042
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:02,319
would go to a place that was highly

1043
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,400
successful mm-hmm and get there master

1044
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,700
grower to interview

1045
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,858
nasty growers there you go hmm that

1046
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:10,449
could be another consulting job I

1047
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:19,259
thought this free time I have

1048
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:22,269
right yeah this you know consult right

1049
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,700
that's funny I've got a friend who owns

1050
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:27,068
a la compliance lab here in LA that we

1051
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:28,328
use can a safe and we're always going

1052
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:29,798
back and forth like I'm in the wrong

1053
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:31,269
game I should be doing lab testing and

1054
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:32,500
then he looks at me he's like no I'm in

1055
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:35,500
the wrong game I should be growing wait

1056
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:53,380
a sec yeah grass is always green on the

1057
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:58,449
other side though right yeah what are

1058
00:38:53,380 --> 00:39:00,730
you working on well when I have a really

1059
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:02,348
good client clone i feminized it i

1060
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,730
feminized it because i can't maintain

1061
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:06,910
all these clones all right

1062
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:09,190
but feminizing doesn't mean you're going

1063
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:11,259
to get an identical plant at all all

1064
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,450
right it's still a mix of genes even if

1065
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:17,619
it's coming from the same plant like I

1066
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:20,259
could you know I'll cause cause I let

1067
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:23,380
two or three branches on a plant to flop

1068
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:26,380
to transition to male flowering right

1069
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,930
collect that pollen pollinate the the

1070
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,430
branches that are still female and they

1071
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:32,219
grow out some of those clothes the next

1072
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:34,960
year and none of them will have the same

1073
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:36,578
terpene profile as the original did

1074
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,889
right which is very disappointing

1075
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:40,390
because I'm usually choosing plants that

1076
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:43,480
I want to propagate because they have a

1077
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:46,868
really great nose and a nice eye but I

1078
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,599
also have been doing stuff with CBD

1079
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:52,630
varieties feminizing those but also

1080
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,470
crossing them with a good THC varieties

1081
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:58,358
and I have F ones and f2s that this year

1082
00:39:56,469 --> 00:40:01,239
here will be grown out to see what kind

1083
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:03,699
of different ratios we get and try to

1084
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:06,519
figure out how this really works in

1085
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:08,129
terms of the CBD and the THC this is my

1086
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:11,199
first

1087
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:15,369
time doing this I was kind of surprised

1088
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:17,799
at the results I had frost a I think it

1089
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:20,829
was a what was called tsunami I'm I

1090
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:24,130
suspect it was a diesel that tested

1091
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:26,769
about 10 percent CBD and no THC and I

1092
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:31,568
crossed that with a jack that outdoors

1093
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:33,280
was testing at 20 percent THC no CBD so

1094
00:40:31,568 --> 00:40:35,139
I thought what what am I going to get

1095
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,060
out of this well I didn't get anything I

1096
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:41,289
expected I what I got was 12% CBD and 6%

1097
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:44,078
THC

1098
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:45,489
it was a perfect 2 to 1 ratio but it

1099
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,068
wasn't anything that I envisioned was

1100
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:50,559
gonna happen so that's why this year

1101
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:52,539
I've already got the seeds I'm prepared

1102
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,489
to do this so I'll work with another

1103
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:56,500
growth or we can grow it you know many

1104
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:58,539
many more than I can do with my little

1105
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,358
grow and start to see if we can make

1106
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:03,130
some sense of all these ratios will come

1107
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,529
out you know and then we can better plan

1108
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:10,019
on how we do this I don't know if

1109
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:14,650
there's going to be a real market for

1110
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:21,699
you know it's the CBD crossed with CI

1111
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:23,740
with THC CBD flowers because this may

1112
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:26,379
all be done by the extracts where they

1113
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:29,709
can get exactly the ratio that you want

1114
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:32,980
how many people if they're taking a you

1115
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,780
know amidst of CBD and THC they're

1116
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,079
taking it most likely for some medicinal

1117
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:41,079
purpose and if they're doing that they

1118
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,260
can always get the exact ratio but you

1119
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:46,329
know I want to be able to produce

1120
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,220
strains that will have those ratios

1121
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:50,109
anyway if people want to smoke them one

1122
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:53,318
of the things that I think will be a

1123
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:55,779
marketable flower as CBD is something

1124
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:59,079
that has a good amount of THC let's say

1125
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:01,300
it has 15 percent THC and it has five

1126
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:02,890
percent CB Dave because I think that's

1127
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,000
something that people can smoke they can

1128
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:05,409
get a high they're not gonna get

1129
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,849
paranoid they're not gonna get anxious

1130
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:08,848
because the CBD is there

1131
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:20,990
right right right

1132
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:31,709
well one of the main objection to

1133
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,570
smoking these high THC things if people

1134
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:35,699
especially in offices because they spoke

1135
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:37,530
too much they do it they get paranoid or

1136
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:40,589
they get very anxious on it you know and

1137
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:42,390
the CVD does counteract that so I think

1138
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:44,820
there will be a market for you know

1139
00:42:42,389 --> 00:42:46,469
higher CBD flower I mean we grow

1140
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,210
Harlequin which was one of the original

1141
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:49,549
two to one ratios I got it from

1142
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:53,070
Harborside Health Center back in like

1143
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:54,210
2010 but that's a really bit of a strain

1144
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,580
I mean that's one of the strains that we

1145
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:58,530
don't covet like if anyone wants the cut

1146
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:00,389
by we will freely give that out because

1147
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:02,610
it has a lot of medical benefits to it

1148
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:05,940
but I can't sell it to save my life yeah

1149
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:08,190
because the real medicinal users are

1150
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,980
switching to extracts it used to have a

1151
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:13,139
good presence in the shelf years ago you

1152
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,789
know shops like to have a high CBD

1153
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:15,839
strange as it should because that was

1154
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:19,710
still when we're back all medical

1155
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:22,050
collective and whatnot but nowadays yeah

1156
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,449
all the extracts are going away all the

1157
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,070
CBS have moved all the extracts but yeah

1158
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:30,949
I would love it you know ten fifteen

1159
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:30,950
percent THC and five c.b.c video flower

1160
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:49,598
yeah Sophie no hunting right you know

1161
00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:51,518
I'm doing well I always I would look for

1162
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,229
the structure to make sure that you know

1163
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:54,969
I like the branching I like the flower

1164
00:43:53,228 --> 00:43:56,649
formation on it that's nice tight buds

1165
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:59,618
those sort of things whether it was

1166
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,970
healthy and vigorous grower and then to

1167
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:03,548
choose between ones that were fairly

1168
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:06,639
similar I would just be you know rubbing

1169
00:44:03,548 --> 00:44:08,288
the the stems branches in and trying to

1170
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:10,989
see what kind of a nose it had when it

1171
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:13,059
was strong or not strong so forth and

1172
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:14,769
then ultimately it's it's what they

1173
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:16,569
actually turn out to be after weights

1174
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:17,828
but you have to breed those things to

1175
00:44:16,568 --> 00:44:19,838
begin with so you have a number of

1176
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:22,630
candidates that you breed and then you

1177
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:25,449
see you know what comes out of that it's

1178
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:29,039
a process and it's it's I'd say

1179
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:31,298
experience really helps a lot and

1180
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:35,769
sometimes she's surprised at what comes

1181
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:37,568
out I mean really seen some very strange

1182
00:44:35,768 --> 00:44:40,228
things happen at me one of the ones was

1183
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:46,509
this if any of you heard of brac City

1184
00:44:40,228 --> 00:44:48,518
brac City is this came out of virtual

1185
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:53,048
Las Vegas is one of the grows there that

1186
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:55,568
I I consult with and they crossed at

1187
00:44:53,048 --> 00:44:56,978
Doctor Who with something else I think

1188
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:59,498
they had some bubble gum that I had

1189
00:44:56,978 --> 00:45:01,748
given them Wow yeah remember things go

1190
00:44:59,498 --> 00:45:05,018
into this and what happened is that the

1191
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:07,238
Brax which I hope you all know are

1192
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:09,788
actually aware of all those resin glands

1193
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:11,889
are the that's the female flowers a lot

1194
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:14,710
of people call those calyxes it's not

1195
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:18,389
true at all they're Brax the calyx you

1196
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:18,389
can't even see on a female flower

1197
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:23,950
anyway the it's called crack city

1198
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:25,900
because the Brax are about three or four

1199
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:28,478
times as large as you see on a regular

1200
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:31,749
plant I mean they're you're like that

1201
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:33,699
size right so that was just something

1202
00:45:31,748 --> 00:45:36,939
that happened it turned out to be a

1203
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:38,858
wonderful cut and yeah for you as like

1204
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,179
right you breed a lot of these things so

1205
00:45:38,858 --> 00:45:42,369
I'm guessing your Fino hunts a lot

1206
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:43,230
shorter than ours but for us takes about

1207
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:45,180
nine months from

1208
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:47,070
the day we pop a seed to the day we have

1209
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:49,769
a commercial amount of product for like

1210
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:51,150
us that's about 20 pounds yeah it's

1211
00:45:49,769 --> 00:45:52,980
about a nine month process and because

1212
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,660
we're always you know we start with 12

1213
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,760
you know 12 pack of seeds and then you

1214
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:58,139
know sex test them through 500 slabs and

1215
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,420
that goes down to six females if we're

1216
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:02,098
lucky and then those six you got to keep

1217
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,380
all the moms on it so it takes up a lot

1218
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,088
of bench space yeah it takes a long time

1219
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:08,130
and it like and it cost like our

1220
00:46:06,088 --> 00:46:09,779
estimates for us like over that

1221
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,099
nine-month period and the wasted bench

1222
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,480
space because now under the current

1223
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,300
regulations if you want to sell that

1224
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,400
each phenome hunter or each a phenotype

1225
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,170
or each you know one two three four five

1226
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,329
six that's a different strain with a

1227
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:23,190
$750 compliance test that you need to

1228
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:25,829
pay if you could even sell it to

1229
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:28,889
marketing yeah so it's about a hundred

1230
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:30,630
grand because of a lost revenue from

1231
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:34,108
that bench space you're taking up and we

1232
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:36,838
only have a 70% success rate right maybe

1233
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:38,608
60 12 actually okay here's something

1234
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:40,949
that we feed onto for nine months

1235
00:46:38,608 --> 00:46:42,900
and then it didn't work enough like none

1236
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:45,118
of them did so it's an investment and

1237
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,800
it's almost like are you intellectual

1238
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,960
property and it's some at some point

1239
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,579
where it's like you know we found this

1240
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,409
one and you know we might not have

1241
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,119
exclusive rights to it but this is

1242
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:56,909
definitely like something that you know

1243
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:58,950
our company has so it's this brings up

1244
00:46:56,909 --> 00:47:01,980
something else and that is is that the

1245
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:04,199
tissue culture and also the the testing

1246
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,480
the testing is just getting more and

1247
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:08,639
more sophisticated where you were

1248
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,980
actually going to be able to tell what

1249
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,108
kind of profile it has in terms of

1250
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,719
tripping and you know whether it's going

1251
00:47:13,108 --> 00:47:19,739
to be pretty strong in in cannabinoids

1252
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:22,289
also but the tissue culture will

1253
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:25,559
eventually I'm sure replace the whole

1254
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:27,539
mother cloning thing oh yeah we're into

1255
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:29,699
space I mean it's just ridiculous that

1256
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:31,710
it's not you know that you wouldn't do

1257
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:34,559
it yeah our next facility we're gonna be

1258
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:36,659
doing tissue culture and turned those

1259
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,309
straight into moms and take the cuts off

1260
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:41,789
those moms because tissue culture is

1261
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:43,559
just great to really reinvigorated it

1262
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:45,750
because you know keeping mother stock is

1263
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,369
challenging it's a high skill set like I

1264
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,710
have one employee at my Sicily that's

1265
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:51,900
his only job and he's great at it

1266
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:54,210
and if I didn't have him we'd be taking

1267
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,410
cuts off of our veggie stock which are

1268
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,789
always healthy and robust

1269
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:59,308
when you have to you know walk around

1270
00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:00,539
6000 square feet of space to get you

1271
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,609
know a couple thousand cuts off of a

1272
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:04,109
plant that takes several days right so

1273
00:48:02,608 --> 00:48:06,449
you know having a good healthy mother

1274
00:48:04,108 --> 00:48:07,980
stock is important but anything past our

1275
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:09,538
scale I think that'd be really difficult

1276
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,099
so we're gonna be you know getting the

1277
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:12,960
tissue culture lab all set up and

1278
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,778
everything and you know I think a lot of

1279
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,759
the advances that we're gonna be using

1280
00:48:15,778 --> 00:48:19,920
it's it's from big AG and so you know a

1281
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:21,269
lot of data and technology I don't think

1282
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,240
we're gonna be having drones you know

1283
00:48:21,268 --> 00:48:25,229
manicure in our plants just yet we're

1284
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:28,909
still always gonna be that human element

1285
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:31,259
but yeah it's gonna take a while

1286
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:35,068
trichome technologies which is out of

1287
00:48:31,259 --> 00:48:38,190
Auckland Ken Morrow still writes for

1288
00:48:35,068 --> 00:48:39,838
canvas Business Times I remember when I

1289
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:44,519
visited his grow that was the first time

1290
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:46,828
I saw you know a motherless grow because

1291
00:48:44,518 --> 00:48:48,419
he just lollipops his plants right they

1292
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:49,589
would grow he would lollipop take those

1293
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,500
more than once and thought that's what

1294
00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:54,088
he you know he then rooted those that so

1295
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,579
it was just a perpetual thing like that

1296
00:48:54,088 --> 00:48:58,710
I did that for years actually I because

1297
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:01,289
my problem was that I couldn't train

1298
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:03,150
someone to maintain the mother stock

1299
00:49:01,289 --> 00:49:05,220
well right because if your mothers start

1300
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,740
degrading you're gonna have like you

1301
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:09,899
know really root weak cuttings which

1302
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:11,219
will lead to weak event weak veg with

1303
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,380
your veg isn't set up right you're gonna

1304
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:14,969
have a bad flowering time so so we would

1305
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,619
just keep you know focus really heavily

1306
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:18,209
on the vegetative cycle make sure

1307
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:20,250
everything was dialed in

1308
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:23,220
take your cuts off that flip into flower

1309
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:24,750
a few days later and then flowers pretty

1310
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:27,868
much on autopilot if you had you know a

1311
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:29,639
really good veg but at this size yeah

1312
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:31,108
the mothers play a pretty important role

1313
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:32,219
but even then it's like you know we're

1314
00:49:31,108 --> 00:49:34,318
in the middle of winter trying to patch

1315
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:36,358
those things out or in a greenhouse it

1316
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,159
takes a lot more light to keep them well

1317
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:39,778
so yeah we're definitely moving towards

1318
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,399
tissue culture and yeah and some of

1319
00:49:39,778 --> 00:49:43,650
those more big AG practices and things

1320
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:47,160
like that but I think do have a home in

1321
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,869
cannabis especially at scale and yeah

1322
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:50,159
that's just things that we have to you

1323
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:53,519
know adjust to as we get this so much

1324
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:56,449
bigger Frank so Lauren we're deaf we're

1325
00:49:53,518 --> 00:49:56,449
fine yeah okay

1326
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:02,449
so the question was when you say scale

1327
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:06,019
what do you mean I think that's anything

1328
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:07,730
above 10 employees honestly you know

1329
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:09,619
I've scaled up other kinds of companies

1330
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:11,780
before you know manufacturing based

1331
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:13,970
companies and once you hit that kind of

1332
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,740
10 people that's when your level of

1333
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:18,259
communication just gets exponentially

1334
00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:20,329
more intense because now if I'm telling

1335
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:22,400
you something well now you have to tell

1336
00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:23,929
someone else to do something as well and

1337
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,358
that just level of communication has to

1338
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:27,858
just get much much more robust right and

1339
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:29,779
we're at 40 full-time employees right

1340
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:31,940
now so I've you know gone quite a bit

1341
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,560
past that so I found you know when it

1342
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,179
was myself I was doing things one way

1343
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:37,549
then I had three employees then I had to

1344
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:39,199
change up everything I did I hit 10 that

1345
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:41,420
was a whole nother dynamic shift and

1346
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,858
then I hit 30 again out of 30 there's

1347
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:46,329
another big dynamic shift of like

1348
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:46,329
actually scaling up so I think anything

1349
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:52,489
I'm looking more at employees because at

1350
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,199
least for cultivation art is like it's

1351
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:55,639
very tacit knowledge it's like the

1352
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:57,679
knowledge that we've gained you know

1353
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:59,719
over the years it's very hard to

1354
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:02,149
transfer to translate to other people

1355
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:04,250
like if I can show you a plant I think

1356
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,539
like you and I could tell you like

1357
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,309
there's a dozen things wrong with it

1358
00:51:05,539 --> 00:51:08,358
but if I try to explain it to someone

1359
00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:10,039
who doesn't have that knowledge that's

1360
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:12,739
very very hard it's like well it doesn't

1361
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:14,150
look back the right kind of green that's

1362
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:15,319
like well why and it's like then you

1363
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,639
have to go back in your data and

1364
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,869
understand that and make sure you

1365
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:20,839
understand all the moving parts in the

1366
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:23,000
facility so anything past that ten you

1367
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,880
have to have a lot of SOPs or a very

1368
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,369
good system in place to get you past

1369
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,619
that otherwise you're gonna be doing or

1370
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:33,079
the quote unquote master grower is gonna

1371
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:34,400
be doing 90% of the work and while all

1372
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:36,590
those other employees are just kind of

1373
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,570
like little helpers getting him done we

1374
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,039
can't be critical thinkers right and

1375
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:42,140
especially when you need to have like

1376
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:44,960
data available and make people make

1377
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:47,389
decisions based on that data that's

1378
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,570
really hard yeah and I think - it's like

1379
00:51:47,389 --> 00:51:52,489
scaling it's like a you know it's very

1380
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:54,050
challenging and scaling just the scale

1381
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:55,309
doesn't make sense either I mean how

1382
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:57,859
many mega grows are out there right now

1383
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:59,539
in California like hundreds of thousands

1384
00:51:57,858 --> 00:52:01,039
of square foot seas in Carpinteria and

1385
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:02,719
Santa Barbara and things like that and

1386
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:04,699
yeah sure they're pumping out like

1387
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,500
thousands of pounds a week but it's all

1388
00:52:04,699 --> 00:52:06,909
garbage

1389
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:12,329
it's all going for extracts and they're

1390
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:12,329
barely making any money so I think from

1391
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:19,300
we sell through distributors throughout

1392
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:22,269
California just flower yeah we don't do

1393
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:24,610
extracts or anything yet like we will be

1394
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:27,460
doing that soon same with the one so

1395
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:30,099
that I collaborate with and and advise

1396
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:33,039
it's all flower because these are really

1397
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:34,900
high-end that very very well done so

1398
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:41,289
everything that they grow is sold at top

1399
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:44,730
dollar mmhmm yeah yeah so the question

1400
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:47,650
was you know what what factors are

1401
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:50,320
involved in deciding what phenotype that

1402
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:52,269
we're gonna select for the market for me

1403
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,789
yeah there's a multitude of decisions

1404
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:56,860
one if the flowering time is right like

1405
00:52:54,789 --> 00:52:59,230
ours our facility is really designed

1406
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,730
around an eight-week flowering cycle and

1407
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:03,670
we've selectively feed on hunted and

1408
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:05,710
bred all of our cultivars and strains to

1409
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:07,539
fit right in to that nicely so it has to

1410
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:10,030
meet that it has to had good yield well

1411
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:12,639
it has to have a good aroma it has to

1412
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:14,190
fit within our portfolio and kind of our

1413
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:17,190
brand as well

1414
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:20,740
[Music]

1415
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:23,019
currently my company Palomar has 20

1416
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:26,559
different strains that we rotate on a

1417
00:53:23,019 --> 00:53:30,309
bi-weekly basis so we'll have an over

1418
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:33,009
course of say two months we'll have for

1419
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:34,719
harvest and three of those harvests are

1420
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:37,200
all different so we'll have set one two

1421
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:39,639
three one and that really helps with our

1422
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:41,379
you know design scarcity in the market

1423
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:43,150
like four years ago I was growing

1424
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,970
nothing but blackberry crush is crushing

1425
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:48,400
it and then one day everybody stopped

1426
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:50,529
buying it it's a crap and it took me

1427
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,119
months to reset and get a new cut in

1428
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:53,500
there and things like that so we rotate

1429
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:54,969
ours and that's where the mother stock

1430
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,829
comes into play and just be able to pull

1431
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:59,049
that brings up the market yeah the

1432
00:53:56,829 --> 00:54:01,090
market is really what determines it you

1433
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:02,019
know you put it you put your stuff out

1434
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:03,640
there and you get back from the

1435
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:05,380
Despenser's that this stuff disappeared

1436
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:07,150
in a week you know and you've got this

1437
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,160
other stuff that's still there five six

1438
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,329
weeks later you kind of know what you

1439
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:11,949
should be growing yeah

1440
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:14,289
so that's really what determines and

1441
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:15,759
that's yeah that's exactly right but I

1442
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:16,599
mean like you know the cookies strain

1443
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,250
right

1444
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:19,900
I can't grow cookies to save my life for

1445
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:22,659
some reason like I'm just the system

1446
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,820
doesn't work I'm not good at it so

1447
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:27,759
there's so many different cookies right

1448
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:29,289
in actuality all different cuts well for

1449
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,060
me they just they never yield it very

1450
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:34,090
well no they don't the small but right

1451
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:35,920
yeah and that's like a really high cost

1452
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:37,809
to produce and I couldn't get more per

1453
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,430
pound for it so it's like that just

1454
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:41,980
didn't make sense for us economically

1455
00:54:39,429 --> 00:54:44,259
even though it's flew off the shelf I

1456
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,179
just couldn't get them kind of wholesale

1457
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,070
price point I needed to make it

1458
00:54:46,179 --> 00:54:50,379
economically viable for our cultivation

1459
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:51,670
system so there's a lot of factors but I

1460
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,349
mean I'd say that yeah what the market

1461
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,119
will bear but making sure it fits into

1462
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:57,610
your own production cultivation system

1463
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,369
making sure you know all those things

1464
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:03,070
fit it's really important I mean just

1465
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:05,079
basically you know one cultivar will

1466
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:07,930
yield boar under the same conditions

1467
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:09,639
that another one will that plays a big

1468
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:11,199
part all those things play a part yeah

1469
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,579
and that's important too like you can

1470
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:14,079
have like we have some heavy yielding

1471
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:15,219
strains we have some lower yielding ones

1472
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,940
but they all have a place in there

1473
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:20,319
because the slightly lower yielding one

1474
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:22,090
you know might help the other ones sell

1475
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:24,190
as well like they're like support

1476
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:26,320
strains almost where it's like you have

1477
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:29,829
the really popular you know Gorilla Glue

1478
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:31,120
or whatnot or wedding wedding cake but

1479
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:32,949
you also have some other ones that are

1480
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,269
really complementary to that because

1481
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:35,980
people it's listed in Southern

1482
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:37,119
California they'll buy an eighth of this

1483
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,380
and they're normal one but they might

1484
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,659
want to buy a grand with another one and

1485
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:42,519
so having that variety for a cultivator

1486
00:55:40,659 --> 00:55:44,079
is really important it keeps you and

1487
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:48,250
keep the market engaged and your buyers

1488
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:51,250
engaged as well I haven't seen wedding

1489
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:52,929
cake yet I mean in person but it looks

1490
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:55,659
really frost I got what he cried I'm

1491
00:55:52,929 --> 00:55:57,419
saying right so that's a wedding cake

1492
00:55:55,659 --> 00:56:00,639
cross with a guy a punch actually so

1493
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,780
okay anyway any more questions

1494
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:04,449
so what's one of the strains you're

1495
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:06,640
still chasing from your youth well I'm

1496
00:56:04,449 --> 00:56:08,559
not chasing it anymore but I wish I had

1497
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,059
the original Durbin poison I mean that

1498
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,250
went to Amsterdam became something

1499
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:13,869
entirely different I'm not entirely

1500
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:16,300
different but quite different but the

1501
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:19,750
first one that I had yeah the one that I

1502
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:21,789
really liked actually I just lost it it

1503
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:24,130
never went to Amsterdam well when today

1504
00:56:21,789 --> 00:56:27,460
I had two different lines of the Durban

1505
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:29,170
I had an A and a B and the a happened to

1506
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:32,108
be the one that I liked the most

1507
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:34,420
a real licorice flavor it had purple

1508
00:56:32,108 --> 00:56:36,460
stigmas which you just don't see you

1509
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:42,099
know purple was some of them with

1510
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:44,019
lavender that I wish I had you know what

1511
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:47,230
you have now is a much more commercial

1512
00:56:44,018 --> 00:56:48,419
kind of rendition of what went to

1513
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:51,369
Amsterdam

1514
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:53,619
part of that problem was that I made a

1515
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:56,920
mistake it's really embarrassing but I

1516
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:59,289
gave skunk me and Sam Afghani one I gave

1517
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,298
him the Durbin the bee line but the bee

1518
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:05,740
line had a little bit of hermaphroditism

1519
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:08,338
in it and I I didn't realize it when I

1520
00:57:05,739 --> 00:57:11,199
gave it to him at the time and I didn't

1521
00:57:08,338 --> 00:57:12,880
find this out until many years later

1522
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:14,768
when he told me you had to work with it

1523
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,900
work with it work with it they get rid

1524
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:19,479
of their magnetism right so that was

1525
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:22,809
part of what changed that that line a

1526
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:25,059
lot but it's a heavier yielder now it's

1527
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:28,480
not a sativa like as it was when I first

1528
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:33,220
got it but it was the most unusual plant

1529
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:35,108
that I I would say variety that I grow

1530
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:37,659
I've seen individuals that were pretty

1531
00:57:35,108 --> 00:57:39,670
spectacular but as a variety it was just

1532
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:41,618
very different from anything else the

1533
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:45,338
main thing was this is what a short

1534
00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:46,900
season it was you know I agree that you

1535
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:48,699
are harvesting it here in Oakland in

1536
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:52,000
September and when I brought it to New

1537
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:54,759
York this is about 60 miles from New

1538
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:59,518
York City we were having some of that in

1539
00:57:54,759 --> 00:58:03,009
August it was that that early so in

1540
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:04,989
being from the east originally my whole

1541
00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:08,829
thing with breeding when I came out here

1542
00:58:04,989 --> 00:58:11,258
was to develop cultivars that could

1543
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:14,079
mature back east before the terrible

1544
00:58:11,259 --> 00:58:15,369
weather came in right because the people

1545
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,650
I knew who grew back there were

1546
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:21,160
basically growing leaf are really crappy

1547
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:25,720
Mexican that had some flowers right and

1548
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:29,170
when I saw a situation out there where I

1549
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:31,689
went back I already had hybrids F ones

1550
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:33,170
of things like Afghani and Congolese

1551
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:35,358
Afghani and Nigeria

1552
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:38,329
yeah and Durban and so forth but I went

1553
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:41,389
back and I took those sativa crosses and

1554
00:58:38,329 --> 00:58:42,680
I back crossed him again to Afghani to

1555
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:45,798
try to make sure that we go out the

1556
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:47,358
shortness of Afghani in there and they

1557
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:49,699
did fantastic out there I mean those

1558
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:51,409
people couldn't believe how strong that

1559
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:56,980
Pape was they had never experienced

1560
00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:59,029
anything like in their lives so now it's

1561
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:01,940
that's pretty cool there's no way that's

1562
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:03,500
going but anyway I just want you guys to

1563
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,539
realize that frame of reference to it's

1564
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,949
like okay like you're breeding stuff to

1565
00:59:05,539 --> 00:59:09,980
grow in New York back when it was still

1566
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:13,179
super really cool like that we get you

1567
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:15,769
thrown in jail for a year tell you that

1568
00:59:13,179 --> 00:59:19,068
yeah that year it was a very successful

1569
00:59:15,769 --> 00:59:22,068
year over 500 pounds of top-notch that I

1570
00:59:19,068 --> 00:59:23,509
mean really top-notch it Samia and these

1571
00:59:22,068 --> 00:59:25,639
guys wanted to do it again the next year

1572
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:28,790
and they were bringing in money people

1573
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:30,409
right who were just drug dealers and I

1574
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:31,969
didn't feel good about it I didn't like

1575
00:59:30,409 --> 00:59:34,940
the people I didn't like the fact that

1576
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:37,759
they wanted to upscale so much you know

1577
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:40,068
it all became it all became the money

1578
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,140
you know I was more interested in the

1579
00:59:40,068 --> 00:59:44,779
actual growing and seeing what happened

1580
00:59:42,139 --> 00:59:47,358
and all that so uh the next year they

1581
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:49,819
they they bought a hundred and forty

1582
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:56,150
acres further away from where we

1583
00:59:49,818 --> 00:59:57,889
originally grow and went at it and I was

1584
00:59:56,150 --> 01:00:01,220
back in California when I got a call in

1585
00:59:57,889 --> 01:00:04,699
July to come out there and help them and

1586
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:06,289
I didn't really want to do that but I I

1587
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:08,088
relented because of the few of the

1588
01:00:06,289 --> 01:00:10,789
people they had sunk everything they had

1589
01:00:08,088 --> 01:00:13,219
into it so in fact did a rescue him and

1590
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:14,659
this was hard to believe they're going

1591
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:17,719
through a whole year of growing this

1592
01:00:14,659 --> 01:00:19,969
very successful crop and didn't see who

1593
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:21,500
haven't learned anything because they

1594
01:00:19,969 --> 01:00:23,539
went from a place that we were growing

1595
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,608
in in like Bottomly and really rich

1596
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:27,679
beautiful soil I mean we had to do

1597
01:00:25,608 --> 01:00:29,838
nothing to soil really you could put

1598
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:32,509
your hand in it it was and just reached

1599
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:35,509
this beautiful soil so it was really

1600
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:37,010
easy to grow the iron so where'd they

1601
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:39,260
where'd they buy this land they burned

1602
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:41,690
that you know another thousand fifty

1603
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,800
nine feet higher where the soil was

1604
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,929
rocky and sand

1605
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:48,080
in additionally New York State that yeah

1606
01:00:44,929 --> 01:00:50,089
at a drought so yeah youkai come a look

1607
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,380
at the plants they have no no due to its

1608
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:55,490
an award I know what it they're not

1609
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:58,000
growing so anyway I kind of remedied

1610
01:00:55,489 --> 01:01:00,709
that and got them growing well and

1611
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,530
sometime in late August I had to come

1612
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:05,210
back to Oakland and it does so I said

1613
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:07,250
you know I'll be back and it will be

1614
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:09,500
right at the harvest and there this crop

1615
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:12,769
would have been over at time would have

1616
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:15,559
been over at time but as I was flying

1617
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:16,130
back they got busted okay so they lost

1618
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:18,769
everything

1619
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:20,300
none of them ended up in jail partly

1620
01:01:18,769 --> 01:01:22,670
because New York didn't understand

1621
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:25,340
growing at that time like they didn't

1622
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:29,510
understand the air before I was standing

1623
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:31,789
in this wonderful fields and one of the

1624
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:33,830
the guys came out he showed me a local

1625
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:35,679
newspaper the headline was that they

1626
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:38,090
estimated that the New York State

1627
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:40,489
marijuana crop that year would be worth

1628
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:43,190
a half a million dollars right and I'm

1629
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:45,259
thinking it's worth more right here you

1630
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:46,789
know I'll be that's how little they knew

1631
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:48,770
about it so when they got busted the

1632
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:50,869
next year they didn't end up in jail

1633
01:01:48,769 --> 01:01:55,909
they just lost everything they lost a

1634
01:01:50,869 --> 01:01:58,369
fortune lucky for that but you know I

1635
01:01:55,909 --> 01:02:00,739
mean I never got busted in my life never

1636
01:01:58,369 --> 01:02:02,329
been arrested and a lot of it had to do

1637
01:02:00,739 --> 01:02:04,219
with luck and a lot of it had to do with

1638
01:02:02,329 --> 01:02:06,949
the fact that I didn't personally sell

1639
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:08,689
marijuana I didn't sell seeds I didn't

1640
01:02:06,949 --> 01:02:11,480
sell anything you know I made money from

1641
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:15,050
my writing in my photography in the

1642
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:16,519
other was that I didn't take accept you

1643

1644
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:20,420

1646

1647
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:27,230
a lot of money and that wasn't really my

1648
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:29,860
interest so much you know I really was

1649
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:33,429
fascinated with the plant the botany and

1650
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:33,430
