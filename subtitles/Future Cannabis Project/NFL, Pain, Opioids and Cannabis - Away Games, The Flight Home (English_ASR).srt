1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,020
the worst thing about the NFL is being

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,628
on a way trip you're playing in New

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,339
England it's cold as hell and then you

4
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:09,449
got to get on a flight and you got to

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,410
fly all the way back home I don't know

6
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:11,729
if you guys have seen football players

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,330
in person but a lot of those guys are

8
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,349
pretty big

9
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,960
I remember my rookie here I'm sitting

10
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,618
next to Tony for no T he's about six

11
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,830
eight 370 and I'm sitting next to the

12
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,179
guy and he's got some edible candies and

13
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:26,278
I asked him was like you know what are

14
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,018
these for he's like oh these are a

15
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,698
little my little weed candies

16
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,018
I was like well what do you think you

17
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,030
can't take that as bad you know the

18
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,859
thing that I know about weed was bad bad

19
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,840
bad can't take that it's against the

20
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:37,619
rules he says man I need something

21
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,570
that's gonna help me with this

22
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,070
information in my hands he says because

23
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,570
by the time were two wheels up on this

24
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,730
plane my hands gonna swell up to twice

25
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,189
the size and literally I watched his

26
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:48,898
body just bloat up he told me that he

27
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,009
was taking a lot of percocets and

28
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,289
vicodins and he was getting a lot of

29
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:55,170
bloating I'm just seeing what the damage

30
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,840
can be done with opiates and I know that

31
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,910
a lot of players were taken like candy

32
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,079
our team physicians would just give you

33
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:02,968
whatever you needed I mean especially

34
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,650
not before a game guys that couldn't

35
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,349
sleep or whatnot they would sit there

36
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,490
and give out ambience and there's no I

37
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:10,048
mean there's supposed to be a protocol

38
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:11,670
for prescribing somebody something like

39
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,680
what are the side effects of this

40
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,030
announce to them maybe they have a

41
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,799
contraindication with other medications

42
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,180
people are taking or predisposed

43
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,390
positions that might cause a psychotic

44
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,330
break which I took em bein one time and

45
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,560
one time only I remember taking it and I

46
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:27,000
woke up in the middle of the night and

47
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,769
my room was in disarray and I don't know

48
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,349
what happened but my roommate was

49
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:32,819
sitting over on the side of the room

50
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,978
looking like what the hell is wrong with

51
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,118
you unless I don't know what happened

52
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:37,560
man what happened he said you just woke

53
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,000
up yelling screaming and throwing the

54
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,769
bed you through this through the desk

55
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,209
everything like it you're insane I don't

56
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,618
know what's wrong with you and come to

57
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:45,149
find out the ambien it caused some type

58
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:46,859
of issue in my head I don't know what it

59
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,399
was from but I was a straight-a student

60
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:52,200
my whole whole schooling career and

61
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,310
always looked at drugs as bad and you

62
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,049
know you hear all the stories about

63
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,280
reefer madness and back in the day your

64
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,659
mom something oh it was that's the

65
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,310
gateway drug and then leads you to all

66
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,810
this other stuff and you know you're

67
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,490
near you're gonna be dumb if you smoke

68
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,799
this or you take this it's gonna be bad

69
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,089
so I just kind of avoided it my whole

70
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,399
life never really did any research on it

71
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,860
didn't use my scientific mind to sort of

72
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,348
figure out what what the possibilities

73
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,390
were could be from using cannabis so

74
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:18,179
so you know go to my whole career you

75
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:19,979
know playing college a lot of people

76
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,540
give NFL flack for what they give the

77
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:23,548
players but college is 10 times worse

78
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,438
because you got to keep your athletes

79
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,269
out there making money for the school

80
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:29,370
and athletes are not getting compensated

81
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:31,049
so what are they doing when they can't

82
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,158
get access to the drugs they're going to

83
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:33,688
find whatever is cheap on the street

84
00:02:32,158 --> 00:02:36,810
which you know as you know as you get

85
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:39,828
when you go on the street so I know when

86
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,289
I was in college I was taking celebrex

87
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:45,030
for joint pain inflammation get to the

88
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:47,250
league never taking vicodin

89
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,620
Vikings made me sick but I had to take

90
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,000
because I was in pain so there was no

91
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,438
alternative for that because at the time

92
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,310
you can't take any cannabis products

93
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,310
because it's against the rules
