2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,699
we're in a time where brands are talking

3
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:19,649
about like we're positioning ourselves

4
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,519
for the future and to me what that means

5
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:29,640
is brands have raised a ton of money and

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:31,619
are going after market share and kind of

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,910
thinking in the long term but the short

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,469
term that's not a very profitable

9
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:39,209
strategy and it has consequences to you

10
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,850
know smaller brands that haven't raised

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,370
a ton of money and so I kind of wanted

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,338
to take a snapshot in time you know

13
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:50,419
September 2019 kind of what are the

14
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:52,649
dynamics between brands and retailers

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,170
and what are you seeing from your

16
00:00:52,649 --> 00:01:00,149
specific vantage point in the industry

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:04,198
so we have a retailer we have a SoCal

18
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:07,799
dominant brand but NorCal not so

19
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:11,118
dominant we have a small scrappy NorCal

20
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,688
craft Sun grown cannabis brand we have a

21
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:18,478
small scrappy SoCal distributor so kind

22
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:21,089
of I wanted to just start by each of you

23
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:25,920
kind of talking about what you're seeing

24
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:29,728
in that relationship between the limited

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,099
retail shelf space and the thousands of

26
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:35,728
brands fighting for that shelf space so

27
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:38,309
Mike Bosse from VCC brands why don't you

28
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:40,140
kick it off thank you my name is Mike

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,219
I'm with the fetish cookie company we

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,200
are a legacy brand we are based out of

31
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:48,449
Southern California

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,789
been in business for about the past

33
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:55,500
eleven years and we're facing tough

34
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:58,170
times just like everybody else since

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,099
regulation and there's many different

36
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:07,228
facets of what's going on right now and

37
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:10,288
I think a few of them could point

38
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:12,539
fingers towards hey retailers are making

39
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,299
it tough on us regulations making it

40
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,159
tough on us

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,140
everything that's happening with

42
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:24,049
industry is a rocking motion right now

43
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:26,329
and I think the people who are going to

44
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:35,060
persevere through this are the people

45
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:38,900
who are really here and passionate about

46
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:42,890
what they're doing right new folks

47
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,250
coming into the industry who might not

48
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:50,479
necessarily have a story but might see

49
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:52,240
the green of money might not last right

50
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:57,769
and I think it really comes down to

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:03:00,730
passion an Eric Pearson retail operator

52
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:04,430
I would dovetail the area and Sonoma

53
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:08,019
with I couldn't agree more and I think

54
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,840
it waits to patients right now there's

55
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:16,310
there's a mad dash with a lot of capital

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,110
to make a lot of money and to build a

57
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,680
brand that's gonna be sticky with

58
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:24,320
consumers and to do that when

59
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:29,330
everybody's doing that you have to burn

60
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,769
a lot of cash and that's that's only

61
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,480
sustainable for a certain amount of time

62
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,719
I think there's too much uncertainty in

63
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:39,709
the industry as it relates to

64
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:41,900
regulations expansion is not as easy as

65
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:45,620
it is with technology I think I use this

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,330
analogy a lot of the times the investors

67
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,759
in Canada and the early investors in

68
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,880
cannabis sort of equated this new

69
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,199
industry with the dot-com or technology

70
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,719
that came along and they kind of thought

71
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,489
well this is something that's explosive

72
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,960
and and therefore we should invest

73
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,920
because the returns are going to be huge

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,480
and then they realized that dokay you

75
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,129
have to get a permit to build a green

76
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,750
house and you have to grow the cannabis

77
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:10,430
in the crown of cannabis the first crop

78
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,349
doesn't do so well then oh shoot the

79
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,420
jars are here from China and and we have

80
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:16,009
to get you to track mitt oh the

81
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:18,379
retailers don't have a license and and

82
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:23,389
so it takes a whole lot longer then

83
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:24,689
investors wanted it wanted it too and so

84
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,849
you have this

85
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:30,250
massive amount of cash coming in to this

86
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:34,960
economy and here in California is it's

87
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:36,399
that's the state to take and everybody's

88
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,529
competing for that shelf space so you're

89
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,120
selling your company if you're if you're

90
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,829
running that race and you're trying to

91
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,259
be the biggest and the best right now

92
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:46,419
you're giving up a major part of your

93
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,490
company and the more you give away the

94
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,100
less interested you are and continue to

95
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,480
run that company so having a love and a

96
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,150
passion for what you're doing and

97
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,490
spending the amount of time that it's

98
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:59,139
taken to get this far

99
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,610
eleven years I've been as cookie company

100
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:02,829
has been here and if we were just

101
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:06,189
chatting about it and I've been up in

102
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:08,769
here since 98 so taking a step back you

103
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:10,949
know looking and realizing that this is

104
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:13,629
just a moment in time and things will

105
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,069
money will be lost and investors will go

106
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:18,089
away and things will settle down and

107
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:21,159
those who have brands that are authentic

108
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:23,699
and teams that are in it for the long

109
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:32,080
run they'll they'll come out winners

110
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:34,000
patients we've been cultivating for

111
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,159
about ten years in Sonoma County we

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,910
launched our tincture brand Fiddler's

113
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,770
greens about four years ago we've taken

114
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,260
a little bit different approach from a

115
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:48,069
lot of the brands who had an idea and

116
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:52,779
when raised a ton of money and expected

117
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:54,519
to just have tons of funds coming in we

118
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:59,289
actually have been focused on building

119
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:00,939
infrastructure and relationships and got

120
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,600
the first cultivation permit in Sonoma

121
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:07,519
County and

122
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09,560
we have manufacturing in distro and have

123
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,169
just finished with our upgrades to our

124
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,560
facility and so now we're really looking

125
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:17,420
to launch as the industry is going I

126
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,740
think we've been fortunate because we

127
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:24,590
started small as prop 64 went into play

128
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,069
and so we're actually growing as the

129
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:30,139
licensed stores are growing so we're

130
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:31,550
just we're ready to take off as soon as

131
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:40,370
they start issuing some damn retail

132
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:42,949
licenses so cow distribution wrapping a

133
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,050
bunch of brands real quick I'm just out

134
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,610
of curiosity so I know like who's in the

135
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:51,879
house how many people here are

136
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:58,120
cultivators and manufacturers

137
00:06:51,879 --> 00:07:02,779
distributors retailers how many people

138
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,699
yeah thank you labs I'm just kind of

139
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:07,189
curious I guess we have a little bit of

140
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:09,529
everyone here and for those of us that

141
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:11,600
have been around for more than a year um

142
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:13,369
I mean we all have different

143
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,740
perspectives but you go through a lot

144
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,180
you know we have the joke of cannabis

145
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,019
years like dog years and we all know

146
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,480
what that means

147
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:24,259
um yeah I think it's like a really

148
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:27,280
interesting time it's nuts it's chaotic

149
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:29,990
it changes constantly I have learned

150
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,819
that I don't know what's gonna happen

151
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,710
next I mean I've seen the tables turn

152
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:36,139
time and time again I've seen the people

153
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:39,319
on top fall to the bottom I've seen like

154
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,419
you know the the crowning of you know

155
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,769
who's on top of the hill change and I

156
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,770
think that it's all up for grabs

157
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:52,909
Wow there's there's actually a lot and I

158
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:56,120
try to refrain from like really talking

159
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:58,160
about other brands too much especially

160
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,750
when it's like who was on top and now

161
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,880
they're not that's not you know I'd

162
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,509
rather big someone up but I would say

163
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,829
that it's extremely competitive and I

164
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:11,000
think that there's a number of ways to

165
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:12,469
compete and I like this panel it's cool

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,600
because I think we're all like kind of

167
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,610
the scrappers as you almost introduced

168
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,759
us as

169
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:21,610
and I think that those people have an

170
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,110
advantage like I you know there's an

171
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,968
advantage to everything if you if you

172
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,800
have huge capital there's great

173
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:28,329
advantages to that right like you have a

174
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,218
problem throw money at it you can no

175
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:31,718
potentially overcome it and there's a

176
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,930
lot of people that can't compete with

177
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:34,208
that

178
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,979
but what those brands can't compete with

179
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,750
is the ground-up approach which I've

180
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,120
always been a fan of and I think the

181
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,009
people that are kind of grassroots that

182
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,980
have a true passion for this that have

183
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:48,009
paid some dues that have kind of worked

184
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,959
and paved their own way forward we have

185
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:52,419
a great advantage because we went

186
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:54,278
through it we know things firsthand and

187
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:57,009
we actually know things we're not just

188
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:59,679
speculating from you know Instagram blog

189
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,419
posts that we've read and whatnot and I

190
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,629
think that those people that have a lot

191
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:06,879
of money but are coming from outside are

192
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:08,230
often and we see this again left and

193
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:12,730
right but we see these people like

194
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:15,278
leaking money like crazy and if they're

195
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:19,930
backed enough then maybe they can

196
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:21,639
sustain and pull through but um yeah I

197
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:23,139
mean it's there's a number of ways to

198
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,000
compete I think you need to have the

199
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:27,159
full package to be honest I think you

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,620
need first and foremost we look at

201
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:32,528
people who's running the company who's

202
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:37,120
behind it you know you have to have good

203
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:39,220
products need a story I think and I

204
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,409
think one of the hardest parts and I'm

205
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,339
in distribution so I'm biased but I

206
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:44,889
think that the sales and distribution

207
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:46,480
may be the hardest piece of it all for

208
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:48,698
the people out there on the ground level

209
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,949
like pounding the pavement knocking on

210
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:53,679
doors and and the thing is is getting

211
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:56,588
into the shops is relatively easy I mean

212
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,629
it's it not it's the relative to the

213
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:00,399
rest of the journey right it's extremely

214
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:02,019
difficult everyone's laughing because if

215
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,769
you've ever tried to get into a cannabis

216
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:07,480
store it's extremely fucking difficult

217
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:09,850
but that's the easy part the more

218
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,370
difficult part is building that brand

219
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,980
and and self through and seeing those

220
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,870
reorders and then if you're a

221
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,019
distributor like we are I talk from that

222
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,399
perspective we kind of are extremely

223
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,769
selective with the brands that we are

224
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:26,409
align ourselves with and we represent

225
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:28,778
them like they're our own and I think

226
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:29,139
that's a mostly that's mostly a weakness

227
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,818
from

228
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,948
distributors from the feedback that I

229
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:35,948
hear I think that most distributors are

230
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:38,948
not out there repping your brand's if

231
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:41,708
you're a brand owner the way you would

232
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:43,988
write and and I think so that's that's

233
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:46,719
our strategy our strategy is to kind of

234
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:48,879
keep a relatively small menu of brands

235
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,399
that were passionate about so going back

236
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,289
to what was said before and just really

237
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,600
reppin it like it's our own and we put

238
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:57,639
our heart into it when we try to make

239
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,350
good decisions and we work with good

240
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:03,999
people and that you know that has helped

241
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,999
us survive this long and we'll see what

242
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:08,859
happens next well so getting back to the

243
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,649
fact that you're all kind of small and

244
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:13,869
food strapped in for me a concrete

245
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:15,519
example like in LA I went to visit a

246
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:19,509
bunch of dispensaries a couple weekends

247
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:23,318
ago and I went into urbe down on Pico

248
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:26,879
and basically they have a lot of shop in

249
00:11:23,318 --> 00:11:30,759
shop where it's almost like you know

250
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:34,509
going into the Bloomingdale's perfume

251
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,850
and beauty section where each brand has

252
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:40,329
you know they're renting space they're

253
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,579
paying their own employees to show up so

254
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:44,859
when I went in there you know then I

255
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:50,219
left and I looked at their Yelp reviews

256
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:53,079
and kind of the common commentary was I

257
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:57,249
this is from consumers I went into this

258
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:59,738
dispensary and I wanted a pre-roll and I

259
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:02,048
walked down and everybody's trying to

260
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:03,399
sell me something that's not it because

261
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:05,379
it's basically all these brands so if

262
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,509
I'm a vape pen brand I don't care about

263
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:09,759
pre-roll as I care about vape pens and

264
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:12,068
I'm gonna try to sell you my products

265
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,808
and when I find out that you don't have

266
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:16,778
an interest in the vape pen you want a

267
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:18,100
pre-roll I lose complete the consumer

268
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:20,558
like the people writing the Yelp reviews

269
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,499
are like they just lost total interest

270
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:25,448
in me or they were still trying to push

271
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:26,769
the thing I told them I'm not interested

272
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:29,948
in like because that's what they're

273
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:34,389
trying to sell so from an end consumer

274
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:36,519
standpoint kind of some of the models

275
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:38,409
that are emerging are like they're

276
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,769
turning people off and and then how do

277
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:42,519
you compete against that those brands

278
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:45,360
that can afford

279
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:48,309
to hire a full-time employee to go into

280
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:53,860
multiple la shots multiple bay area

281
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:56,559
shops wherever you can't do that yeah we

282
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,409
definitely can't do that I mean our our

283
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,149
core product is teachers and topicals

284
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:04,689
which is I think like one or two percent

285
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:06,610
of the total sales we've only we've

286
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,190
actually because most of our patients

287
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,899
are our customers our medical patients

288
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,630
we haven't had a lot of pressure from

289
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:15,220
retailers about buying shelf space but

290
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:18,070
the handful of people that have reached

291
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,529
out to us they've wanted more in shelves

292
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,150
for shelf space than they do in revenue

293
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:24,189
for us each month and obviously that's

294
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:25,809
not a sustainable business model but

295
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,390
companies that are well financed are

296
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:31,089
actually doing that oh absolutely

297
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:32,620
you know we none of you will name names

298
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,590
you're at least acknowledging that this

299
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:39,879
is happening oh yeah absolutely this is

300
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:41,740
definitely happening and I mean we are

301
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:46,360
seeing the exact same thing as you guys

302
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:48,159
it's it's not a sustainable option it's

303
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,419
not a sustainable way of doing business

304
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,509
you know

305
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:54,610
venez cookie company has been in

306
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:57,100
business for the past 11 years off of

307
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:02,590
our own dime just recently we've gained

308
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:06,129
some investors which is fabulous but the

309
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:09,370
shelving space right we're being asked

310
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:12,789
for $2,000 a month and when it comes to

311
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,919
edibles the average ticket is $2,000 a

312
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:18,129
month right so why am I going to give a

313
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:19,839
retailer $2,000 a month when I'm not

314
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:21,820
going to be able to sell them that much

315
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,220
it just doesn't make good business sense

316
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,260
for us yeah no we're in the same boat

317
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,790
and I'm we're pushing back on those

318
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:29,529
folks and we're like we'll go across the

319
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:31,719
street and we'll deal with the

320
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,189
dispensary that wants to support local

321
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,200
brands that wants to support legacy

322
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,260
operators and we're going to send all of

323
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,780
our customers without shop but so

324
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:43,210
between the three of you what percentage

325
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,189
of shops that you're trying to get into

326
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:52,330
are like if you pay us a little bit of

327
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:54,700
money it's a pretty it also done I would

328
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,230
say it's training up and it depends on

329
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,900
the territory

330
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,750
different territories or some are more

331
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:05,829
likely to do that it's it's almost like

332
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:07,419
cultural so depending on the territory I

333
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,960
think you see a little bit more of that

334
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:13,870
in the valley interestingly enough um

335
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:16,090
and I would say it's it's still I don't

336
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,730
know I would say it's 20 percent under

337
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,410
20% of shops maybe but it's it's not

338
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,750
very few I mean there's a lot of them

339
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:24,850
charging for sale shelf space and some

340
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,659
of them like urbe you know just to get

341
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:31,570
back to that um no no I mean yeah I look

342
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:33,370
I'm not I did we said we do business

343
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,170
with herba right and we've done business

344
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:38,320
with her before a long time we've never

345
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:40,240
paid for a shelf space now we're not

346
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,250
gonna have the same presence there as

347
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,289
other brands so but but that's a store

348
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:51,070
that will allow if they believe in your

349
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:52,809
product they'll care you so you're gonna

350
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,400
have to out hustle everyone and that's

351
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:56,529
kind of the theme that we kind of live

352
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,679
by is just out hustle everyone to make

353
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:01,629
things happen so to give like a current

354
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,909
example are our main brand right now is

355
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:07,029
tikkun olam which is a very medicinal

356
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:09,610
brand it's an Israeli brand so a pretty

357
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:10,750
technical brand as far as like cannabis

358
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:14,139
brands go it's probably the most

359
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:17,259
technical and so we dedicate a lot of

360
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,970
time to train the staff and and stoke

361
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:21,129
them and that's part of what we do for

362
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,889
all of our brands is like make personal

363
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:25,539
connections with everyone get them to

364
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:27,370
understand whatever it is the brand

365
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:29,169
story is in this case there's a lot of

366
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,389
information that we can educate them

367
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:34,089
with but sometimes it's just a lifestyle

368
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:35,860
and it's like a vibe and but if you can

369
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:38,590
translate that vibe and you can really

370
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,080
touch you know those those staff the bud

371
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,639
tenders and whatnot and stoke them out

372
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,320
you know it helps when you have some

373
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,879
schwag or whatever but those are all

374
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,340
ways to play the game without playing

375
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:51,789
paying for shelf the shelving space in

376
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:55,060
certain stores other stores yeah some of

377
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:55,599
them charge of the serious ticket to 3

378
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:58,479
grand

379
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,070
sometimes more just to play just to get

380
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,959
in the store and sometimes it doesn't

381
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:06,670
make sense and for us the strategy 95%

382
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,799
of the time is we don't pay for shelf

383
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,080
space um some of the has

384
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:15,430
to do with us or our brand more often

385
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:18,789
than us but yeah we try to add value and

386
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:21,190
try to you know just present the value

387
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:22,480
of the brand and why it's a value to

388
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,920
them and their customers and if they

389
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,720
don't see that then we don't have a

390
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,430
problem keeping and moving and like you

391
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,740
said work with whoever's next door and

392
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:34,960
and pump it through there and yeah how

393
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,210
about things like trade samples and you

394
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,860
know introducing your brand's all the

395
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,450
but I mean things you could do a couple

396
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:43,000
years ago where you're introducing the

397
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:46,090
brand to all the bud tenders and giving

398
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,609
them samples and letting them appreciate

399
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:52,929
what you do which is a little more

400
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:55,750
costly now we're still trying to do that

401
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,519
I think it's very important for folks

402
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,859
that are representing our brand to have

403
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,660
used it to understand it our

404
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:04,240
distribution model is also very

405
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,980
education based and so before a

406
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,259
dispensary gets our gets the first

407
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,970
delivery from us we have one of our

408
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:11,650
account managers come in and do a

409
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,390
budtender training they talk to them

410
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:16,210
about a said it cannabinoids they talked

411
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,730
to them about what CBD is good for what

412
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,620
THC is good for so that it's not just a

413
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,240
conversation of oh yeah I've got this

414
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:25,299
you know dab that's ninety-nine percent

415
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,480
THC because that's not our customer our

416
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:30,369
customer is sick you know sick children

417
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,910
you know parents who have kids with

418
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:35,799
epilepsy it's grandparents you have

419
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,509
arthritis and things like that and so

420
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,269
the education side of it's super

421
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:42,519
important to us being on shelf space and

422
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:45,639
having educated by tenders who represent

423
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:47,940
us then in a way that communicates our

424
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,380
message and what we're trying to do I

425
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:54,039
think getting samples out into buyers

426
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:57,070
hands is extremely important and we've

427
00:18:54,039 --> 00:19:00,549
transitioned from outside crews bringing

428
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:04,659
in samples to manifesting and drivers

429
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:06,940
delivering those samples and I think

430
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,610
it's going to evolve even more into

431
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,410
here's our non-activated product give

432
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:13,569
this non-activated product to try it

433
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,880
tastes just like darn activated product

434
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:19,220
right especially when it comes to

435
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,380
edibles is and not for joints

436
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,089
right it doesn't it doesn't work for

437
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,740
everyone for flowers and extract that

438
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:27,829
doesn't work for edibles that were it

439
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:30,769
works perfectly if you're pushing a

440
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:33,169
brand getting that brand to engage with

441
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:35,059
the staff whether it's the buyer or the

442
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,610
bud tenders anyone you can get with

443
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:39,769
that's critical it's critical it's

444
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:41,869
critical that you engage with on that

445
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:43,369
they can try the product because there's

446
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:45,859
so much more likely to sell it if

447
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:49,009
they've tried it it's worth every penny

448
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:51,769
I personally am a huge fan of investing

449
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:53,180
in the store I you know shelf space I

450
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,279
don't think has the best return on

451
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:59,539
investment but I think investing in the

452
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,970
store in terms of samples of hooking

453
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:05,240
them up with swag of your time and

454
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:07,329
effort the training the demos and just

455
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,620
stopping by being there in person I

456
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:13,759
again coming from a district I think the

457
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:15,739
brands are better at representing

458
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,500
themselves in doing the the work that I

459
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,240
think like it takes to get through to

460
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,369
stores and actually promote their brand

461
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,170
than most distributors and that's just

462
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:26,750
going by most of what I hear you guys

463
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,910
maybe have had other experiences but um

464
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,099
spending time in person in those stores

465
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,320
whether it's with a sample or a piece of

466
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:35,929
schwag or it's just your time you just I

467
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:37,639
mean people appreciate people also

468
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,710
connect with people and if you take the

469
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,380
time to hear someone out and and you're

470
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,779
not just there to kind of like some kind

471
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,710
of quickie and then how thing then

472
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,599
you're gonna build a relationship

473
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,829
they're gonna like you they're gonna get

474
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,369
to know the brand and they're gonna be

475
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:53,809
more likely to support the brand so I

476
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:55,879
can't agree with you more I think it's

477
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:59,359
it's all about a partnership and that's

478
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,250
what I preach to everyone at the fenders

479
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,309
cookie company it's a partnership we

480
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:08,390
need to start a partnership right and

481
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:11,240
what is selling to somebody without

482
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:13,220
being partners to them when you walk

483
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,750
into a store and they say the only way

484
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,670
that you can get on our shelves is by

485
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,519
you paying us two thousand dollars this

486
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:23,140
month and every month after this that's

487
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:25,920
not a partnership that is a shakedown

488
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:34,130
you know that's my opinion yes

489
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:39,150
I agree Eric retailer as a retailer you

490
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:41,910
know as a retailer the bond between the

491
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:45,870
retailer and the consumer is very

492
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:47,430
important and to what all you said is

493
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:49,500
when you walk in and what you initially

494
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,910
initially started with Peter is when you

495
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:56,400
walk in and you've given up your

496
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:59,519
retailer to brands just representing

497
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,720
themselves where shelf space is sold so

498
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,269
we were walking in looking for a joint

499
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,740
and you're going passivate you know

500
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:06,599
cartridge and you're and you're losing

501
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,539
that connection with a customer I don't

502
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,279
think that's a long-term strategy for a

503
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:15,079
retailer I think you're gonna see brands

504
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:19,740
come and go through there so having that

505
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:21,899
as a retailer you know it this

506
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,000
dispensaries are very interesting

507
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,390
because this is not normal retail right

508
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,420
you know we go to pharmacies like this

509
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:32,460
but we also just go to pharmacies which

510
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,490
are closest to our homes you know and we

511
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,430
everything else we buy is through online

512
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,920
or a very sort of what I call I guess a

513
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,779
horizontal approach to retail to where

514
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,509
you just you go to the closest place

515
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:48,269
that you can shop and you buy things but

516
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:50,160
with dispensaries it's similar you you

517
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:55,109
you go to the closest dispenser you can

518
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,700
get to that but you develop a

519
00:22:55,109 --> 00:23:01,769
relationship with with that organization

520
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,220
and it's I lost my train of thought so

521
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:05,490
fit

522
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,410
but I think the important the important

523
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,480
thing is when you're selling your store

524
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,950
to someone else in order to make those

525
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,829
sales then you're losing that connection

526
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:16,350
with with the customer so yeah and I

527
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:19,349
think this is I don't know if I am

528
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:22,859
around enough in the Bay Area but I know

529
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:26,069
we don't sell shelf space I don't think

530
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:29,609
we sell at our five stores and I hear

531
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:31,049
about it up to $20,000 per month for

532
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:32,369
some of these brands in Southern

533
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:34,680
California

534
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,689
and you know you don't you don't connect

535
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,430
and the customers that we have

536
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,410
we're vertical so we're a little bit

537
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:43,019
different than the average retailer that

538
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,430
says I've got a prime location you know

539
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:47,460
I know I'm going to have these customers

540
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:49,080
coming in so as what we do is we sell

541
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,630
our own products right and we have that

542
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:54,389
relationship with the customer and

543
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,920
honestly we'll have the big brands

544
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,809
because people will come in and say I

545
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,630
want being chocolate or all when Kia or

546
00:23:57,808 --> 00:24:02,430
whatever it is and we'll take them over

547
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:05,220
to our brands we'll say yeah we have

548
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,480
those but we also grow our flowers over

549
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,200
here we make these products ourselves

550
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:17,400
and we want you to buy these that's our

551
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:19,289
approach traditional retail markup is I

552
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,200
sell you something for a ten and you

553
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:24,210
sell it out the door for twenty and it

554
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,759
seems like in the cannabis industry

555
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:32,490
sometimes you're it's being sold out at

556
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:34,140
the door for 30 so what are you all seen

557
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,210
like as brands what do you sell

558
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,259
something into a retailer what are you

559
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:43,110
seeing them mark it up by BPI where I'm

560
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:49,379
coming from is consumers and patients or

561
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:51,529
the like unrepresented group here from a

562
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,300
price point they're not happy and

563
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:55,859
obviously some of its taxes but some of

564
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,928
it is like I'm trying to understand why

565
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:02,159
sometimes stuffs marked up more than

566
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:09,179
traditional retail so I'm not sure what

567
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:13,440
you guys do and I would say that 65 70

568
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:16,110
percent of our customers do a 3x markup

569
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,630
on edibles and a 3x our markup on

570
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:21,689
edibles is really tough to them

571
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:26,490
consumers and not only is it tough to

572
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:28,350
them consumers but in my opinion the

573
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,650
retailer's aren't going to see that

574
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:33,750
volume of sales from those and from

575
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:36,870
those end consumers because of that 3x

576
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:42,059
markup and I would agree with you that

577
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:44,939
the end consumers are looking for less

578
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,750
expensive products that's why we can see

579
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:51,930
them going to the

580
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:53,759
illicit market right now and if maybe

581
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,860
you can help in lameness I'm not sure

582
00:25:53,759 --> 00:26:01,259
what you guys do but generally speaking

583
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:03,269
over the retail market why is it that we

584
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:06,599
are finding that there is a 3x markup

585
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:08,490
right now I think it's location you know

586
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,589
back to whatever is the most convenient

587
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:12,779
store to go to a lot of folks will just

588
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:15,240
go to the most convenient store I think

589
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:17,069
on average most of our stuff is 2x we're

590
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,420
in a market that's fairly competitive in

591
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:19,980
San Francisco and probably very

592
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,460
competitive we have a lot of delivery

593
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,380
companies E's and their partners you

594
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,809
know have a lot of larger companies I

595
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:33,750
have a lot more capital to burn to gain

596
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:35,669
market share if in theory I think if

597
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,259
folks are charging 3 X's because they

598
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,850
can get it you know they're in a limited

599
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:40,170
market they've got the foot traffic but

600
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:44,429
if you're in a competitive market you

601
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:46,289
know you can't do that well I hope Erik

602
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:49,320
out hit a little bit here I think part

603
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:52,039
of it too has also been with the

604
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:55,559
segmentation of the industry a few

605
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,269
during prop 215 days retailers were able

606
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,429
to package they were able to do some

607
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:02,039
things and take some cogs write-offs on

608
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:04,680
their taxes and with the way the

609
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:07,740
industry set up now retailers are almost

610
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,390
paying like taxes on their gross sales

611
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,690
they don't get to take those cogs

612
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,700
write-offs anymore and III think that

613
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,070
has a lot to do with it and also the

614
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,450
fact that just trying to justify

615
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:20,909
competing with the black market so we've

616
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,430
created the situation where we've priced

617
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,050
ourselves out of being competitive so

618
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,150
now we have to charge more to justify

619
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:28,889
being here and it just it's created a

620
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,509
vicious cycle the only business partner

621
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:39,720
any of us have making money right now is

622
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:47,549
the state of California I think they're

623
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:51,710
losing too when you're dealing with

624
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:53,519
brands what I mean what are some of your

625
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,740
frustrations

626
00:27:53,519 --> 00:28:00,019
I guess well I don't deal with them

627
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,019
directly when you're

628
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,130
it's that guy over there right so when

629
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:09,549
that guy bitches to you what is what is

630
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:14,500
he bitching about I can't say I get not

631
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:19,659
a lot really does he does he complain

632
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:21,460
about friends complaining about that you

633
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:24,070
I know I've because it's consistent

634
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,750
everywhere it's constant unreliability

635
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:27,399
right it's people saying they're gonna

636
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,380
do things they don't do them they're

637
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,660
unavailable you hit them up you don't

638
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,520
get hit back right away you get orders

639
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:37,330
for stuff you didn't pay for you didn't

640
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:39,970
order what else there's 1,300

641
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:42,730
manufacturers and 700 retailers that

642
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:46,079
might be part of the problem they're

643
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:49,170
wearing 10 hats instead of two or three

644
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:52,619
half most of them are maybe underpaid

645
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:56,289
yeah they're overwhelmed with so many

646
00:28:52,619 --> 00:29:02,669
people like just trying to get their

647
00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:05,529
attention and man there's so many things

648
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:15,789
how right am I how many buyers do we

649
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:19,329
have in the house savvy other what

650
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:20,889
metrics a VI metric I think they're all

651
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:23,829
being forced to be I think if I'm not

652
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:26,530
mistaken like most retailers either just

653
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:29,919
did or in the middle of or are are

654
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:33,460
imminently having to you know apply like

655
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:35,140
get in on the metric so I think right so

656
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,130
all right so down the line what kind of

657
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,520
metric nightmares

658
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:41,620
are you having at night well we've

659
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,079
strategically stayed away from metric we

660
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:44,739
don't we have our provisional for for a

661
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,079
while

662
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:52,450
we don't legally need to be on metric

663
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:54,189
we're grateful to just let it like buy

664
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,289
something we have some time and and

665
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,059
we're gonna hopefully let metric and the

666
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:00,430
rest of the fucking industry get their

667
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:02,049
shit together because it's a shit show

668
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,240
like trying to deal with metric we hear

669
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:06,190
the nightmares left and right and they

670
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,509
call in and metric doesn't even know

671
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,480
what's going on they don't know how to

672
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:11,859
do things you're bringing up I mean this

673
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,410
is what we're hearing from retail

674
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:16,329
and other brands and stuff so for now

675
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,880
we're our strategy is to stay away from

676
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:20,889
metric so as a distributor you have that

677
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,030
luxury for now because I don't think

678
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:31,330
we're now let's have that like for this

679
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:34,808
part and I'm not gonna lie yeah I think

680
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:38,710
buyers are having two challenges one now

681
00:30:34,808 --> 00:30:40,240
right now well first is 1,300

682
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,548
manufacturers knocking at their door

683
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,929
right that that's that's one of the

684
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:46,629
major problems is that they're

685
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:49,620
overwhelmed with the amount of brands

686
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:52,390
that are coming knocking at the door and

687
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:54,279
and who did they buy from right and

688
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,980
who's going to perform the best and I

689
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:58,629
think the second most major challenge

690
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:03,750
that's happening currently with buyers

691
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:06,549
are metric and metric is being put on to

692
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:09,400
these buyers to be able to operate on

693
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:12,308
and so this is a learning curve for the

694
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:17,250
buyers that they now have metric that

695
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:20,500
they have to deal with and I think that

696
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,759
there is gonna come a time and I really

697
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,009
hope not but I think there's gonna come

698
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,048
a time where buyers are gonna say are

699
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:28,779
you on they already have asked me are

700
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:31,960
you on metric and the answer is yes

701
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:33,970
right and if the answer is no they're

702
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,370
gonna say I don't know if I really want

703
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,509
to work with you right now right it's

704
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:40,449
here it's here what's happening

705
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:42,129
understand be nice yeah I'm not gonna

706
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,440
lie I come from the software industry

707
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,510
I'm actually pretty excited about metric

708
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:51,759
it's been pretty painless for us to

709
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:54,750
implement does your husband thank you

710
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:58,549
enough my husband track

711
00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:03,630
[Laughter]

712
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:07,259
all right so Eric you you you have a Bay

713
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,030
Area shop and you have a were in Santa

714
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,769
Rosa you have a shop how far away from

715
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:11,910
here yeah we do all kinds of stuff

716
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:14,549
that's why I don't have the answers to

717
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,440
these things so we're yeah we're

718
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:18,569
vertical so we have we have a we farm

719
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,210
and Glenallen and we manufacture in

720
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:22,769
Santa Rosa and we have stores three

721
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:26,100
stores in San Francisco one in Santa

722
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:29,639
Rosa one and one in Sebastopol okay so

723
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:32,129
Sebastopol so talk about the economic

724
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,860
decision making there are a lot of local

725
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:39,600
brands mm-hm and so I guess my question

726
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:42,959
is in your local retail operation are

727
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:44,849
you proactively featuring local brands

728
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,309
and have-nots what are kind of the

729
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:49,889
business decisions you're going through

730
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:51,990
to decide that it's just not feasible

731
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,940
yeah most most brands we feature are

732
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:56,700
from Northern California so I'd say

733
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,440
local unfortunately Sonoma there's not a

734
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,410
whole lot of brands because of the

735
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:05,100
regulatory kind of difficulties within

736
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:09,900
the county you have one city next few

737
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:17,699
champions do you carry her brand no

738
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:19,500
Shawn do we carry Pilar's not yet what

739
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,049
why not have you been pitched by them

740
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:25,109
why I don't know I I mean I I do like

741
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:27,539
I'm I do a lot of stuff but but retail

742
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:28,949
is not my focus okay I probably should

743
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:33,389
that's Shawn up here talking about

744
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:34,890
retail be partially your question what

745
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:39,630
was the first part well it's basically

746
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:41,870
like what are the economic airy the

747
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:45,150
amazing craft sun-grown

748
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:47,369
regenerative hugo culture or local well

749
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:49,110
yeah okay so well smart first honestly

750
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:51,209
we will we will sell everything that we

751
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:54,990
produce and manufacture first that that

752
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:57,569
is ultimately our objective that's as

753
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:59,309
the reach as a vertical retailer I think

754
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:04,740
I think the further south you go the

755
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:06,960
more larger brands that are coming and

756
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,300
going I don't see that the revolving

757
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,898
door up north and we've been around for

758
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,730
a long time

759
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,828
and a lot of the brands that we have on

760
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:18,789
this shelf continue and have been around

761
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:20,409
for a while and I I'm not experiencing

762
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:22,629
the disruption I think that a lot of

763
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,608
retailers in Southern California are I

764
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:27,898
think we have a lot of consistency with

765
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:27,898
her brands from from Northern California

766
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:34,449
answer the question do you have

767
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:39,309
something to say back to that what Shh

768
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:42,960
where's our buyer I'm honestly I'm gonna

769
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:45,278
give Eric a pass on this one too because

770
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,849
Northern California markets tough

771
00:34:45,278 --> 00:34:51,909
because San Francisco Sonoma County are

772
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:55,240
a short drive from the triangle and this

773
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:57,039
is the belly of the beast us being in

774
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:00,578
the industry ten years we're a new brand

775
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:02,170
in Northern California and we spend a

776
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:04,630
little time banging our heads trying to

777
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,769
get into some local shops and we were

778
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,358
competing with people that have been

779
00:35:05,768 --> 00:35:09,459
there for five or ten years before us

780
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:11,199
and been consistent so our strategy

781
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,608
after being in our head for a couple of

782
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:13,989
months was we're going south and we're

783
00:35:12,608 --> 00:35:16,480
taking Northern California to Southern

784
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:18,159
California and we've been crushing LA

785
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,460
we've been crushing the desert we've

786
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:23,558
been crushing San Diego and you know I I

787
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,880
hope that that that the tables turn

788
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:26,859
because I think we're one of the few

789
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,900
survivors I think you know there's a

790
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:30,460
handful of legacy brands that are still

791
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,338
standing and I'm proud to say we're one

792
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,778
of them and it's a bunch of badass

793
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:37,420
people that are in this room right now

794
00:35:34,778 --> 00:35:39,369
that bleed for this company every day

795
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,869
and you know I hope that we start

796
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:44,079
getting that recognition in our local

797
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:46,150
market but I understand how we got where

798
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,269
we are I just I would love to see a

799
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:55,539
change so Eric what's your what's his

800
00:35:49,268 --> 00:35:59,169
name these guys Shawn you better run my

801
00:35:55,539 --> 00:36:03,759
sharks are here all right so just

802
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:05,470
quickly wrapping it up if each of just

803
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:10,480
down the line of each of you can talk

804
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:13,988
about a a regulation that is a pain

805
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:17,289
point for you and companies like you and

806
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:22,809
which regulatory agency is responsible

807
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:23,859
for that and what your better regulatory

808
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:25,509
policy

809
00:36:23,858 --> 00:36:28,328
is towards that specific piece of

810
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:30,338
regulation I think the biggest thing

811
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:32,440
that's holding back this entire industry

812
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:34,239
right now is two things I can't answer

813
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,579
with one I think it's two things I think

814
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,099
it's the over taxation of excise tax and

815
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:41,499
I think it is local ordinances who are

816
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:44,859
not allowing more dispensaries to be put

817
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:46,899
into their areas right there's 700

818
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:48,518
licensed retailers some odd licensed

819
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,309
retailers in the state of California

820
00:36:48,518 --> 00:36:54,098
that's just plain and simple not enough

821
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,809
and there needs to be it can't be one

822
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:58,390
approach of oh well let's just bring the

823
00:36:55,809 --> 00:37:01,119
tax down or oh let's just add more

824
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:04,268
retailers it needs to be multifaceted

825
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:11,950
and I think it is reduce that tax add

826
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:13,498
more retailers free the cookie I would

827
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:15,879
agree with I'll just add some other

828
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:20,230
challenges I know Northern California

829
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:24,099
faces and in here in Sonoma County as it

830
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:25,449
relates to cultivators I think what's a

831
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:28,509
real problem it's really going to

832
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:30,699
destroy what our industry is if hasn't

833
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:31,960
destroyed a lot of it and that is the

834
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:33,848
environmental regulations around

835
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,849
cannabis and the way cannabis has been

836
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:39,670
treated differently than agriculture I

837
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:42,818
think you know four years ago we thought

838
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:44,858
Humboldt was going to in Mendocino was

839
00:37:42,818 --> 00:37:47,889
going to own that the cultivation for

840
00:37:44,858 --> 00:37:49,929
the state and and it's not you know I

841
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:52,268
don't see heading that way I see the

842
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:55,949
cultivation heading down into the valley

843
00:37:52,268 --> 00:37:57,998
to large large industrial greenhouse

844
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:59,169
facilities that's where as most of us

845
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:02,078
going to end up and I think that's an

846
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:04,930
unfortunate thing an unfortunate

847
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,720
situation or result of the way we've

848
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:10,118
regulated we've approached cannabis as a

849
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:14,379
nuclear factory instead of a plant that

850
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:17,380
it is and we're seeing a lot of you know

851
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:19,028
every grower I know is north of

852
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,640
California north of San Francisco is

853
00:38:19,028 --> 00:38:24,130
back to the black market it's

854
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:25,868
fascinating how it affects you know the

855
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:31,720
prices and the black market versus that

856
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:34,239
the legal market but I think that's the

857
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:37,219
that's one of the regulations that's

858
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:39,230
caused the most amount of

859
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:40,669
and destruction to the industry that we

860
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:45,260
that we had and the people that created

861
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:47,300
it I would agree with everything both of

862
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,010
these gentlemen said one of the other

863
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,350
things it's really crippling us right

864
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:54,080
now is that my salespeople cannot carry

865
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:56,750
samples and drop them off after they

866
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:00,259
have a great appointment with a buyer it

867
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:03,050
takes two three four days to place an

868
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:06,200
order manifest a product package it up

869
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:08,900
ship it and get it to a purchaser and by

870
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:10,969
then they've seen 30 40 50 a hundred

871
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:13,030
other purchasers and they don't remember

872
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:15,169
why the hell they got this box product I

873
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,360
think that's one of the biggest things

874
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:20,360
we need to be able to solve is having

875
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,980
salespeople account managers hand a

876
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,140
product to a buyer say here try this

877
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:32,659
hand it to your staff I'll talk to you

878
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:35,299
next week yeah I I agree with everything

879
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:38,029
I was said if there's something to add I

880
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:40,100
think writing off of cost of goods sold

881
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:43,930
is probably gonna help with some of us

882
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:47,119
operate and in the regulation the actual

883
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:49,929
enforcement of regulations is one thing

884
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,819
that I don't think I heard directly

885
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:55,219
address but yeah more licensed

886
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,530
storefronts lower the taxes actually

887
00:39:55,219 --> 00:40:01,789
enforce the regulations on the people

888
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:03,710
who are not abiding and and give those

889
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:06,469
people a path people that have been

890
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:08,170
doing this for 10 20 30 years give him a

891
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:10,369
fucking permit

892
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:13,610
do you bring up a really good point

893
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:16,039
there's there's what I believe that an

894
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:18,260
article came out saying there's 2,100

895
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:23,269
illicit stores in the state of

896
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:26,450
California so it's just a way mostly in

897
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:28,250
Southern California but the problem is

898
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:30,019
is some of these guys are bad players

899
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:32,570
and they shouldn't be in our industry

900
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:35,000
but I think the majority of them need

901
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:37,039
help and need a path and don't have the

902
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,320
money or the cash flow necessary to be

903
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:43,849
able to become legal and I think it's

904
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:47,930
very important to help them out any

905
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:49,440
peanut gallery comments the woman in the

906
00:40:47,929 --> 00:40:57,849
back row

907
00:40:49,440 --> 00:41:00,369
haha oh well I mean we're heading to a

908
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:03,519
metrics inevitable right we're just

909
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:06,279
holding on until we absolutely have to

910
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,650
and we see it in our very near future

911
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,019
it's just I mean we're gonna be bringing

912
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:14,590
our metrics sooner than later it's just

913
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:16,750
a luxury that we have at this moment and

914
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,610
yeah we we we haven't had a single

915
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,949
retailer turn us down but 100 percent

916
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,390
that conversation is coming up and we

917
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:23,889
see it right there it's not like we're

918
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:29,349
gonna try to avoid metric it's

919
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:30,849
inevitable right and we're not maybe we

920
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:32,589
don't even know all that when you have

921
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:34,569
to be scared of I mean it's just for us

922
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,309
it's like it's an inconvenience that we

923
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,740
could potentially postpone just a little

924
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:40,539
bit longer and and hopefully in that

925
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:42,939
time a few things I mean one thing that

926
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:45,820
I think we've all learned is like the

927
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:49,480
people that are kind of innovators and

928
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:51,880
or or doing things first are paying a

929
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,699
huge cost to do it you know what I mean

930
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,650
and that's not just financially and then

931
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:58,869
you occasionally I mean in really the

932
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:01,210
pioneers or the people who built this

933
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:03,039
industry who are not me these are people

934
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:06,550
that have been here you know for a

935
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:09,130
decade or three or more the work that

936
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:11,230
those people did that paved the road

937
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:15,130
that we get to travel down I mean what a

938
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:17,949
luxury we have right and so you know and

939
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:20,200
I am grateful to those people and I want

940
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:22,719
to express my gratitude to those people

941
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:26,169
but those people don't get you know they

942
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:27,969
don't really get like the any benefit

943
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:32,889
from what they did they did the hard

944
00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:34,779
work and so I'm just not quick to be

945
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:36,460
like oh yeah let's be the first ones

946
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,890
there I mean it would be cool and I

947
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,960
think there's advantages to it um but

948
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:43,509
there's also disadvantages and in my

949
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:48,309
experience in this industry is is like

950
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:50,230
play like on the fringe of what you can

951
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:52,150
get away with without crossing the line

952
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,889
liking you know don't you don't risk

953
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:56,619
your whole business or license up but

954
00:42:53,889 --> 00:42:58,960
like the people who win are playing some

955
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,429
sort of a gray area and most of them are

956
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,720
playing a much greater than what we're

957
00:43:00,429 --> 00:43:05,629
doing but that's that's the real

958
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:10,009
ecology of of you know all's anybody

959
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:14,240
disagree with that statement I do I

960
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:17,359
absolutely do there for us there's no

961
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:21,409
gray area anymore and it's completely

962
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:23,329
black and white to us because but you

963
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:26,239
disagree that a lot of companies are

964
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:28,789
planning ray areas oh no I think a lot

965
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,889
of companies are planning the best that

966
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:37,130
are following the letter of the law or P

967
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:42,379
being penalized for sure so just last

968
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:46,490
question as to you Fiddler's high tide

969
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:48,530
and you socal entering NorCal all right

970
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:52,549
do you see any nuance differences

971
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:56,450
between dealing with SoCal retailers and

972
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:58,760
NorCal retailers or like obviously there

973
00:43:56,449 --> 00:44:01,069
are more than two markets it's two it's

974
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,119
two different animals the NorCal market

975
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,650
is completely different than the

976
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:06,559
Southern California market you brought

977
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:09,200
up the fact that like the bay area is

978
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:12,769
the Beast of the belly and in fact

979
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:15,649
really is it's definitely been one of

980
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:19,880
the hardest markets for us to penetrate

981
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:21,619
and we have been around for a long time

982
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,559
right and we have a large Southern

983
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:26,660
California following and perhaps maybe

984
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:30,219
that large Southern California following

985
00:44:26,659 --> 00:44:33,920
and perhaps that Southern California

986
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:34,939
home base puts us at a disadvantage when

987
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:42,950
we're talking to Northern California

988
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:46,000
buyers and that that's what I see all

989
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:48,529
right well thank you all very much and

990
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,079
thank you to the whiskey tip for having

991
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:55,030
us and we're gonna have some music

992
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:55,029
outside then there's karaoke inside

993
00:44:56,909 --> 00:45:00,079
[Applause]
