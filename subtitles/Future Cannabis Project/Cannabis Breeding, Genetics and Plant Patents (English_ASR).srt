[Music]

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,570
we both are involved with the open

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,289
cannabis project and that's something

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:25,609
that I'm very passionate about it has to

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:29,099
do with cannabis and and patents and

6
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:31,650
intellectual property and you're an

7
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,350
attorney in that field so I'm sure we

8
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:37,649
have lots to talk about

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,689
yeah I think we do I got kind of pulled

10
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,850
into cannabis a few years ago I'd been

11
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:49,289
working with plant breeders for a long

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:51,870
time and someone who had started a

13
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,780
cannabis genetics analysis kind of

14
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:58,198
company wanted me to give him some

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,539
advice about open cannabis and I thought

16
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,308
it sounded interesting and it's evolved

17
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,820
into something that is a daily passion

18
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,308
for me

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,290
so that's alright I'm excited to talk

20
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:10,859
about it well you know thank you for

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,630
your interest and you know I think for a

22
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,688
lot of us folks that have been breeding

23
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:21,688
cannabis for a long time this is a

24
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:23,758
hot-button issue and you know I I don't

25
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:26,639
necessarily have all the answers but I

26
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,700
definitely have some opinions okay so

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,868
what do you think are the problems why

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:38,939
is it why are patents a hot-button issue

29
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:42,060
okay well here's the crux of it in in my

30
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:46,129
opinion that cannabis is unique in that

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:51,090
it's been under prohibition for you know

32
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:53,519
around 100 plus years well less than a

33
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,000
hundred years in some ways but it's been

34
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,039
you know it's it's been under

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,549
prohibition for almost 100 years

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:08,849
and that has made it so the common like

37
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,290
publishing of breeding data that happens

38
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:15,098
in an agricultural community

39
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:20,938
as not happened at all and so you know

40
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:25,688
if I created a new strain or cultivar

41
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:27,900
twenty years ago like I did I never in a

42
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:32,799
million years would have you know

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:36,400
written that down I mean shit like if we

44
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:38,829
kept records we made a practice of

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,010
burning them at the end of the season

46
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:44,439
like literally I remember doing that and

47
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:47,620
and you know thank God that we're not

48
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:52,829
doing that anymore but you know that has

49
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:55,959
made there there's now a vacuum of any

50
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:59,469
what's called I guess in the the patent

51
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:02,469
world like prior art evidence of prior

52
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:04,120
art and you know for folks that don't

53
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:06,068
know prior art just means like something

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,980
that people have done in and created

55
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:13,509
already and so it's not new and novel

56
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:19,030
and because there's this vacuum there is

57
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:22,929
the possibility that folks could come

58
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:25,239
and claim you know that they've created

59
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,590
something that they not didn't

60
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,599
necessarily create it may have been

61
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:32,709
something that I had or any breeder

62
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:38,138
might have had in their you know tool

63
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:40,719
chests for our tool box for years and so

64
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:43,629
why should someone be able to then go

65
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:46,628
and just snap that up and then come to

66
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:49,209
me with a cease and desist and say you

67
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:52,358
can no longer grow that variety that

68
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,098
you've been growing forever well that's

69
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:57,250
it I think you've exactly framed the

70
00:03:54,098 --> 00:04:00,459
problem I've been doing patent law for

71
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:03,128
about 20 plus years and I've worked in

72
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,438
biotech and medical devices in a lot of

73
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:07,598
different areas and what happens when

74
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,209
someone applies for a patent as you kind

75
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,548
of correctly stated is that the patent

76
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:17,189
examiner looks to what's already in the

77
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:17,189
public domain and they look for

78
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,660
published documents such as academic

79
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:27,290
publications

80
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:30,140
patent patent documents as well as any

81
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:33,110
kind of commercial record and they use

82
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:35,120
that to identify alright here's a patent

83
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,120
application that claims to invented X Y

84
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,040
Z and I want to see what is the closest

85
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,199
thing to it that is already in the

86
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:47,810
public domain and then they use that to

87
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,800
figure out what really is new and what

88
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,990
should be allowed to be patentable

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,400
that's a hard job yeah but they do a

90
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,990
careful analysis when they're doing

91
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,709
their job right they do a careful

92
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:03,500
analysis of kind of drawing lines

93
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:07,359
between what someone claims to invented

94
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,100
and what is already known of the public

95
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,580
so okay we overlay that with the

96
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,580
cannabis

97
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:20,269
the cannabis market or the cannabis

98
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:22,609
industry yeah and we have a unique

99
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:26,089
problem of an industry that has

100
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:29,210
essentially no recorded history as the

101
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:31,969
opposite of recorded history a history

102
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:34,399
that was affirmative ly destroyed right

103
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,950
there is no academic record there is

104
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,659
essentially no patent record yeah any

105
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,719
commercial record was hidden

106
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,990
instead of published Brant Burnham I

107
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,900
would what stop exactly exactly and so a

108
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,269
patent examiner though has the same duty

109
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:52,579
the same mission they read a patent

110
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:56,149
claim that says I invented X Y Z and

111
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:58,310
then they go do a search and they look

112
00:05:56,149 --> 00:06:02,089
for prior patents and academic

113
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:04,790
publications and some kind of record of

114
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:07,909
commercial activity and they find almost

115
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:11,080
nothing and then they're supposed to say

116
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:13,580
they're supposed to determine whether

117
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,009
someone who claims to have invented a

118
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:23,750
certain strain or a certain family of

119
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:27,170
strains with some properties and they

120
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,170
it's their job to assess whether that's

121
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,939
in the public domain or not and they're

122
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,040
working with their hands tied behind

123
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:38,649
their back and there and with a

124
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:41,000
blindfold on and all they can do is

125
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:43,279
follow the guidelines that they're given

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,420
and they issue a patent and then you and

127
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:49,309
I both know that we may not know for any

128
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,730
given patent whether it's valid or not

129
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:56,810
whether they mate whether it's wrong

130
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:59,600
that they found it to be patentable but

131
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,509
what we do know is that there's a hell

132
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,250
of a lot of reason to doubt that what

133
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:08,029
they found to be patentable actually is

134
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:10,579
because what we know is that the public

135
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:12,409
record is a complete vacuum that there

136
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:14,779
are things that happened that never got

137
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,600
recorded and you're a living witness of

138
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:20,959
that and so you see a patent that issues

139
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,750
and you say oh hell no I did that myself

140
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,149
or I know people who did that 20 years

141
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,089
ago and yet now someone is saying

142
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:33,529
they're the first ones to do it and so I

143
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:35,000
look at that patent I being you I look

144
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,429
at that patent and say I don't respect

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,279
it I don't think that it should be

146
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,490
enforceable I don't think that it should

147
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:45,409
throw off a whole industry I don't think

148
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,360
that people should change their

149
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,189
commercial activities and out of respect

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,560
for this patent and if I get a cease and

151
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:53,569
desist letter I'm gonna gather my

152
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,939
friends with their pitchforks and their

153
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:59,899
torches and we're gonna have an uprising

154
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:01,069
over this and it's understandable and

155
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:03,139
you can't blame the Patent Office

156
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:06,259
they're doing their job they don't have

157
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:09,050
the tools to issue a proper rejection

158
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:10,789
right you might blame the applicants if

159
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,770
their applicants that actually know the

160
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:16,010
industry and they're just taking

161
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:18,649
advantage of the lack of evidence

162
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:20,629
and they're they're basically doing some

163
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,639
kind of gold rush land grab because they

164
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:24,290
can because they've got the power and

165
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,478
the resources and they're just doing it

166
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,910
out of bad faith then they deserve the

167
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,370
mob with the pitchforks and and the

168
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:34,038
torches to come after them but maybe

169
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,219
they don't even know so we're in a

170
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:41,088
situation where there needs to be

171
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:43,459
some kind of other public forum to bring

172
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:46,579
to bring forward the knowledge that

173
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:49,698
exists in the in the memories and the

174
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:53,239
heads and perhaps some hidden records of

175
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:55,088
people like you so ok enough for me

176
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,720
what do you have to say about all that

177
00:08:55,089 --> 00:09:03,889
enter the open cannabis project you know

178
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:07,329
I mean for most of my adult life I've

179
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:10,579
worked in the nonprofit sector as a

180
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:13,549
fisheries biologist and you know did

181
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:17,388
River restoration projects and so I feel

182
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:21,609
like if there's a a framework or a

183
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:24,430
structure for for an organization to

184
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,870
tackle this issue that the nonprofit

185
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:29,359
framework is kind of the best because

186
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,549
you know you've got somebody who is

187
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:38,060
essentially hopefully isn't putting any

188
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:42,289
bias into this isn't bringing you know

189
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:44,028
the ideas of of some big agenda agenda

190
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:46,639
exactly they're they're looking out for

191
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:50,328
it a you know supposedly the the good of

192
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:53,778
the of the whole and and I think in

193
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:58,399
particular you know folks that need some

194
00:09:53,778 --> 00:10:01,698
protection are the kind of you know mom

195
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,458
and pop cannabis cultivator and sort of

196
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:07,299
the original pioneers of this industry I

197
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:10,698
mean now we're in Vegas this biggest

198
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:13,758
convention center there's thousands of

199
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:17,899
booths here obviously deep pockets

200
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:20,028
involved in this industry you know I I

201
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:23,419
do I worry about my community in

202
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:26,838
Humboldt and I worry about you know the

203
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:29,628
local like just for example my hometown

204
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,480
in Humboldt County the fire chief is a

205
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,250
cannabis grower he's a volunteer that's

206
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,970
he spends a lot of his time as a

207
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:40,669
volunteer firefighter and wildfire you

208
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,639
know kind of an issue lately we're in

209
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:44,939
California I was in California yes

210
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,100
turday and

211
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,970
and in the world's biggest wildfires are

212
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:54,720
happening so to get back to the point

213
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:59,399
you know Jessie is having a really hard

214
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,019
time financially and that's just signs

215
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,579
sign of the times but these are good

216
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,649
people you know these are the volunteer

217
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:08,340
the chief of the Volunteer Fire and

218
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:10,199
Rescue and the school teachers and you

219
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,210
know a lot of folks have somewhat

220
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,970
supplemented all the great things that

221
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,740
they've been doing with their farming of

222
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,990
cannabis and that's just not going to

223
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,399
happen anymore and and that kind of

224
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,379
stuff is changing maybe it can still

225
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,250
happen in some respect but the last

226
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:27,659
thing we need is a bunch of you know

227
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,600
cease and desist letters and patent

228
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,219
infringement lawsuits stopping people I

229
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,610
mean we've all seen what happened and

230
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:39,990
this is cliche but you know when

231
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:44,490
Monsanto had their fancy corn and the

232
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:46,950
pollen blew from their cornfield in Iowa

233
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,070
or wherever it was over to the Organic

234
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:52,320
farmer's cornfield and he said he he

235
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,540
kind of started the fight I think said I

236
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,650
don't want your pollen your GMO pollen

237
00:11:54,539 --> 00:12:00,779
in my organic field you know I I want to

238
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:04,649
be organic and and that's actually my

239
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:06,990
market and I saved my own seed and they

240
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:09,480
said oh you're gonna screw with us well

241
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,159
we're gonna sue you for patent

242
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,039
infringement because you're now growing

243
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:16,980
our patented corn and you're not giving

244
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:21,539
us a royalty or or you're not paying us

245
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:23,820
our licensing fee so that could happen

246
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:26,459
it's it's not inconceivable that that

247
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,190
could happen in cannabis it's pretty

248
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:32,220
perverse isn't it it is it's you know

249
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:36,630
that's I mean I'm gonna get off topic

250
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,879
but that's capitalism and and greed I'm

251
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:41,340
not a fan of either of those things

252
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:46,679
especially not unbridled capitalism and

253
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:50,269
greed so well I think I guess my own

254
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:53,750
take on it is that if there's a solution

255
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:55,919
it is more transparency and more

256
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,318
communication about the actual history

257
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,719
yes

258
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:03,028
the essence of a good intellectual

259
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,790
property system is that it can't take

260
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:07,708
something out of the public domain once

261
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:09,719
it's actually in the public domain

262
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:11,188
yeah but we can't know whether something

263
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,859
is in the public domain unless we

264
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:15,719
document it that's right and the fact

265
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,788
that there isn't a good documentation

266
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,178
about what was in the public domain when

267
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:24,198
cannabis was kind of in the dark yeah

268
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:26,850
means that we need to take some steps to

269
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:28,469
document the public domain ex post facto

270
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,449
that's right away

271
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:33,389
I agree and that means that people need

272
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:35,488
to step forward and say especially in

273
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:38,339
the context of newly issued patents or

274
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:42,209
newly patents that are newly applied for

275
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:44,220
we need people to step up and say no no

276
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:46,108
this is this is already in the public

277
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,788
domain and here's my evidence of it

278
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:53,699
here's what I know was happening 10 20

279
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:56,278
years ago or whatever as long as it was

280
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:57,808
prior to the filing date and this is why

281
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,588
it's in the public domain and this is

282
00:13:57,808 --> 00:14:03,509
why this patent is invalid and here is a

283
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:07,350
coalition of people who are willing to

284
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:10,709
stand together to to provide that

285
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:15,199
evidence and to essentially form a

286
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:20,068
resistance aren't we the militants and

287
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:22,099
really - you know it's not even in my

288
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:24,028
take you know you don't even have to be

289
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,038
anti-capitalist you just have to stand

290
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:27,720
in favor of the public domain

291
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:29,519
really if something's in the public

292
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,189
domain then damn it let's let's make

293
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,078
sure it stays there yeah there there

294
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:40,139
there is even if you're Pro capitalist

295
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:41,998
you can't have a meaningful IP system

296
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,999
that can grab things out of the public

297
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:47,308
domain and appropriate them to one owner

298
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:49,769
yeah it's just messed up that that

299
00:14:47,308 --> 00:14:51,749
doesn't work yeah because as soon as you

300
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:54,568
can't rely on something being in the

301
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:57,418
public domain one day and possibly being

302
00:14:54,568 --> 00:15:00,149
taken out another day then nobody has

303
00:14:57,418 --> 00:15:01,278
any certainty about their rights also

304
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:05,818
whole world

305
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:09,658
where's civilization world coming to

306
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:10,659
dogs marrying cats so you know I totally

307
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,659
agree and

308
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:15,698
just to finish that point like I you

309
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:20,620
know I mentioned I you know I'm not

310
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:24,189
necessarily like like you know so

311
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,860
radical that I would I would never say

312
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:28,750
that you know I found it humbled seed

313
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,810
company I wouldn't tell you that I'll

314
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:35,198
never patent a cannabis strain I'll tell

315
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:38,500
you right now that I'm not gonna just go

316
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,359
and and grab something that is that

317
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,669
isn't yours that you didn't original

318
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,060
that's for sure or or that's like really

319
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:49,750
commonplace so I mean you know the

320
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:51,969
things that we could you know think

321
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,120
would would think about potentially

322
00:15:51,970 --> 00:16:00,540
wanting to protect with a patent you

323
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:03,220
know like something like very unique

324
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:07,899
cannabinoids that have taken years and

325
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:11,170
years of of breeding effort to to grow

326
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:13,448
and develop and the you know that is

327
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:15,669
just something that that I haven't even

328
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:21,698
really I don't even know if we've had

329
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:25,389
enough time even using like traditional

330
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:30,969
breeding practices or even using genetic

331
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:33,310
markers you know to there there may be

332
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,699
some some groups that that have that

333
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:38,799
kind of IP and and maybe there's

334
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:40,508
definitely maybe there's some warranted

335
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,438
patents out there I don't think that I

336
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:47,188
want to make a blanket statement and and

337
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:50,469
I'm not just like blanket oppose to

338
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:54,250
patents in the cannabis space or patents

339
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:56,199
on plants unlike the whole patents on

340
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,879
living creatures a lot of people say you

341
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:59,919
know like I don't I'm opposed to that

342
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:02,828
altogether I mean there has to be

343
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:05,259
incentive for us as breeders and it has

344
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:09,038
to be somehow like a legal hammer to

345
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:11,230
protect that incentive and you know

346
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,679
we've used different techniques other

347
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:17,500
than patenting in the past and that's

348
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,509
been successful such as like licensing

349
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,328
you know like we'll have a license

350
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:23,980
agreement with several nurseries

351
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:27,188
throughout California currently

352
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,730
and you know that has worked wonderfully

353
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:32,048
and you know what I feel like is it

354
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,798
should be something that benefits both

355
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:40,119
of you anyway like if you're a nursery

356
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:45,119
and you want a license of varietal that

357
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:47,529
I've spent a long time developing I

358
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,089
license it to you you maybe give me a

359
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:54,069
royalty every time you take a clone from

360
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:56,470
it and then in turn I'm like dales

361
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:58,960
nursery calm everybody he does a great

362
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,600
job and and we worked hard on this

363
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,798
varietal and now he has it and the right

364
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,149
to propagate it and openly and you know

365
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,490
it's it's my opinion that if somebody

366
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,429
else comes in and gets it and starts

367
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:14,470
propagating it without my permission

368
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:17,500
you know that's not necessarily a great

369
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,390
thing but they also don't have the

370
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,269
benefit of me sitting there being like

371
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:27,580
Dale's nursery is the one that is the

372
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:30,940
the the right person to go to to get

373
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:33,668
what I had created and and so those

374
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:37,150
kinds of things I think are ways that

375
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:41,890
that we can proceed and have incentive

376
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:46,330
for breeders you know without big

377
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:47,679
overarching patents and at the same time

378
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:49,240
that you know there could be some really

379
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,890
unique things I mean there will be

380
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,009
incredible things that come out of

381
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:56,679
cannabis breeding and and different

382
00:18:54,009 --> 00:19:01,359
techniques for cannabis growing and all

383
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:05,048
the stages of the game and those may

384
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,959
very well deserve patent protection and

385
00:19:05,048 --> 00:19:11,168
so I don't think that but it's just this

386
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,269
very unique situation that we have where

387
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:17,890
we've had years of prohibition and so

388
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:19,418
there's a vacuum of data and I think

389
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,270
that's something that the open canvas

390
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:25,809
project is is tackling and doing a great

391
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:27,910
job and and providing being a leader in

392
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:30,339
that you know and there's a lot of work

393
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:32,730
left to be done so they need I'd say

394
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:36,750
support from the community as a whole

395
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:39,130
well a couple things on that

396
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,539
one of my favorite sayings is that when

397
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,210
you're a hammer everything looks like a

398
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:46,869
nail and I'm a patent attorney and so I

399
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:50,259
kind of like patents but I really hate

400
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:52,928
patents that aren't valid where someone

401
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:54,849
is basically being dishonest and taking

402
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:58,000
something that isn't theirs because that

403
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:59,589
wrecks the whole system rights and

404
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,720
especially when we're talking about

405
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:03,399
utility patents where someone says they

406
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,620
invented something that they just damn

407
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,660
well did not invent yeah that really

408
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:09,699
makes me AM because it messes up my

409
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,830
industry yes

410
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,808
on the other hand I've worked with some

411
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:16,240
plant breeders well I broke worked with

412
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:18,789
plant breeders my whole career and some

413
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,039
of them not as much in cannabis because

414
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:23,500
it's a it's a plant that you can

415
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,940
propagate quickly and you can select it

416
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,950
you can select a lot of them you can

417
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,320
plant a lot of plants in a relatively

418
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,150
small space but I've worked with

419
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:34,269
breeders of grapes and stone fruits

420
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:36,730
where they might spend literally eight

421
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:38,889
to ten years selecting a special variety

422
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,740
exactly and developing a variety that

423
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,929
has commercial value that might last for

424
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,539
twenty or thirty years right and if they

425
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:50,559
don't patent that someone can grab one

426
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:52,779
plant and ranch carry it off a branch a

427
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:55,990
small cutting and carry it off and

428
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:57,849
propagate acres and acres of that yeah

429
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,259
and misappropriate ten years of

430
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:01,149
somebody's work that's right

431
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:03,220
ten years you know and if there weren't

432
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,559
a patent system to protect that work

433
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,089
that investment these guys wouldn't have

434
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:08,799
a job yeah they wouldn't have an

435
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:11,740
employer their employers wouldn't have a

436
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,509
business yeah and all of us wouldn't

437
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,160
have those special varieties they spend

438
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:17,980
all that time developing yeah so you

439
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,870
know maybe the world would still turn if

440
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,970
we didn't have grapes that ripens two

441
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:24,939
weeks earlier or that tasted that much

442
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,350
better or whatever but there is a hell

443
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,150
of a lot of work that goes into that and

444
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:31,058
that's right that's what the plant

445
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,650
patent system exists to protect I do

446
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:38,079
have a friend who's a cannabis breeder

447
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:39,309
and he I absolutely believe that there

448
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,740
are a lot of things that aren't worth

449
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:43,660
patenting even though I'm a hammer and

450
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,058
everything looks like a nail there are

451
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,730
some things that you know you can

452
00:21:46,058 --> 00:21:49,990
protect just with agreements either

453
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,788
handshake agreements

454
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,829
or written agreements and you can say

455
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:56,980
alright I'm not gonna bother to patent

456
00:21:53,829 --> 00:22:00,250
this but when I send you my clones I'm

457
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,558
gonna ask you to only make only

458
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,528
propagate this many and to pay me this

459
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,210
much and to restrict anybody else from

460
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:09,548
propagating and to sell them for this

461
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,929
much and it is kind of respect the fact

462
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:11,889
that I originated it and give me some

463
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,259
credit yeah

464
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,850
that can work I do have this friend

465
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:19,259
though there's a cannabis breeder and he

466
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:20,829
actually did that and he sold his friend

467
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,980
500 clones

468
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:26,379
pretty soon he sees this strain showing

469
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,569
up in catalogs and he knows it's his

470
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,130
strain it's distinctive and I think his

471
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:32,288
friend might have even used the same

472
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,450
name and so he called his friend and

473
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:36,700
said hey dude where's my money what's

474
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,429
the deal you're selling us in catalogues

475
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,220
and he said oh you know sorry business

476
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:44,200
business is business

477
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:48,009
dude I you know yeah we had an agreement

478
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,778
but this is this is real life and that's

479
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:52,619
when he came to me and said I think

480
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:56,230
maybe I need a patent my strains because

481
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:59,709
some people you can't trust and that's

482
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:02,649
kind of what it comes down to at some

483
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,659
point things are valuable enough that

484
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:07,509
even if you wish you didn't have to it's

485
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:10,630
nice to have the recourse that's not the

486
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:12,669
case with everything but to this extent

487
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,929
that you invest a whole lot of work and

488
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:15,520
a whole lot of time and you make

489
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:18,038
something really special and a lot of

490
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:20,859
people are gonna want it sometimes it's

491
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:24,869
worth doing I not gonna say it always is

492
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:27,579
and perhaps with with a plant that is

493
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:30,428
easier to breed quicker to propagate

494
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:32,109
quicker to select and there are a lot of

495
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:34,809
a lot more strains and a lot more

496
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:38,259
variety it doesn't always make sense to

497
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:39,339
patent it but there is something about

498
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:41,169
that and I think there's a big

499
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:43,829
difference between plant patents and

500
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:46,419
utility patents and especially the

501
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:48,250
potential for abusing utility patents by

502
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:49,778
just pretending to invented something

503
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,220
that you damn well didn't invent and

504
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:54,970
taking it out of the public domain that

505
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:57,009
that does make me kind of crazy well I'd

506
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:59,470
say clearly this isn't necessarily just

507
00:23:57,009 --> 00:24:01,929
a black and white issue I think one

508
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,089
thing to take home is the open cannabis

509
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:06,180
project

510
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:08,309
is a much needed resource for the US

511
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:13,740
Patent and Trademark Office and for our

512
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:16,710
community industry and that Dale you are

513
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,779
a very knowledgeable person I'm on this

514
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,630
subject and I think that it would be

515
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:24,240
great to have you come on board with the

516
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:28,950
cannabis project literally on the board

517
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,019
maybe it's a non-profit so you know

518
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,789
it'll be public records soon enough

519
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:34,799
thank you well we could geek out about

520
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:36,299
this for a long time but fortunately

521
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,529
we're out of time right now they're

522
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:39,899
probably trying to kick us out of this

523
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:42,269
hall so yeah that's probably all for now

524
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,060
I see that the guys in black coats I

525
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:47,129
don't know if if I'm just staying

526
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,960
overstaying my welcome or maybe I've

527
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:52,760
been infringing on some Manhattan I

528
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,759
don't know about it's tequila time

529
00:24:54,869 --> 00:25:01,819
you

530
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:01,819
