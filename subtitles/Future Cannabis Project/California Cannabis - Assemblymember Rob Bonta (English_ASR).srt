2
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,210
I'll just share a little bit of a look

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,699
back a reflection on the current state

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,859
of our cannabis laws and regulation and

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,140
then and then talk about what the future

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,429
might hold again my name is Rob Ponte I

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,099
served in the California State Assembly

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,988
I represent Oakland Alameda and San

9
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,619
Leandro I'm probably most known for

10
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:39,238
having maxima Colonus in my office

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:43,919
where's max max is here somewhere

12
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:47,070
there's max so I mean this is the man

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,579
who wrote the MCR essay and spent

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,539
thousands of hours and in meetings you

15
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,518
know working it out with with

16
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,960
stakeholders and I've I feel like we've

17
00:00:56,518 --> 00:01:00,539
come a long way in a short period of

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,198
time and we're still not where we need

19
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,629
to be but I think there has been a new

20
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:09,359
mood and a new openness among California

21
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:12,868
state legislators to address cannabis

22
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:15,659
policy like any other policy issue that

23
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:16,769
affects our residents it affects the

24
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,790
people of California affects our

25
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:23,340
businesses our patients our environment

26
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,930
our health and safety and and and that

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,689
is good because when we when we were

28
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,899
working on this issue back in I think it

29
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:34,500
was 2014 in the fall and then throughout

30
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:37,950
2015 that was not the case we had a lot

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,590
of legislators who this is a bit of an

32
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,359
exaggeration but not really when I would

33
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,728
say hey I have this cannabis bill I'm

34
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:46,919
working on I'd love to have your support

35
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,239
I'd like to explain it to you and let

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,439
you know what it does how it's good for

37
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,819
California how it's good for the

38
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,949
environment how it's good for patients

39
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,688
that was good for safety and they would

40
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,159
almost put their fingers in a cross and

41
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,489
back up slowly and say that's the

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,229
cannabis bill I'm a no on that and it

43
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,298
was just any mentioned of cannabis seem

44
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:06,868
bad and and and because it carried this

45
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,090
stigma right and so through our work and

46
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:11,610
I say our because this has been very

47
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,520
much a team effort between a number of

48
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,230
legislators who sort of lifted up the

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,420
original M CRS a work it was

50
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:20,209
Assemblymember Joan Sawyer assembly

51
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:23,659
members would

52
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:26,420
somebody member Cooley and a bipartisan

53
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:30,199
group Assemblymember Lackey who worked

54
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:32,089
on this together with myself to really

55
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,139
do something groundbreaking to to do

56
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,789
something that hadn't been done in

57
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:37,129
twenty years to provide this regulatory

58
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:39,469
regime in the state of California for

59
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:41,509
medical cannabis that we hadn't had

60
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:43,400
since the passage of the Compassionate

61
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:46,639
Use Act and this had been something that

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,930
had been tried it wasn't it wasn't for

63
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,299
lack of trying had been tried multiple

64
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,550
times and it had failed multiple times

65
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,560
and one of the reasons that I think we

66
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,910
were able to succeed was because we we

67
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,229
set about to address this in a different

68
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:01,819
way rather than have one coalition of

69
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:04,009
stakeholders on one side that had

70
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:06,199
traditionally been together largely the

71
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:09,829
League of California cities and public

72
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:12,139
safety folks on one side and have sort

73
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,410
of our patient advocates and and and

74
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:16,969
Labor and Industry on the other we

75
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:19,310
decided to work together and invite a

76
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:21,949
big table and say anyone who's

77
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,379
interested in making our cannabis policy

78
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:26,569
better stronger more effective working

79
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:28,280
out the kinks and doing something

80
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:31,219
historic you're welcome to come to this

81
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,840
table and put your best ideas forward

82
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:35,840
and they will be considered they might

83
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,539
not always be implemented or included in

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,240
the final piece of law but they will be

85
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:42,769
considered and and and that's what we

86
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,020
did and that and that's that's where max

87
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,969
came in that's where someone else you

88
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,290
may know in the cannabis world who's now

89
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:50,479
working who was on my staff at the time

90
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:53,509
on she so came into play they both

91
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:56,329
worked hours and hours listening to

92
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:58,099
everyone and tried to get to try to get

93
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:03,020
the best piece of legislation possible

94
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:05,210
and we we slowly made progress we we

95
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,310
kept moving past hurdles where in the

96
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,500
past legislation had fallen down and

97
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,629
failed and either failed in committee or

98
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,919
gotten held and then we finally got on

99
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:14,870
the verge of the governor's desk and

100
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,909
then when you're close to the governor's

101
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,160
desk that's when he gets engaged and he

102
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,840
started looking more closely at the

103
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,970
legislation had his staff get involved

104
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,009
and they had some ideas that they wanted

105
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,600
to include as well and so we were able

106
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:28,370
to have a discussion with the governor's

107
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,530
office and then in 2015 we got the MC

108
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,579
RSA passed and that was exciting because

109
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:32,869
they didn't never been done before and

110
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:35,180
that was exciting because it had been

111
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,009
done in a way that had never been done

112
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,709
before with with a coalition working

113
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:42,409
together side by side and that group of

114
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:45,319
legislators and stakeholders I think

115
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,660
continue to be committed to to to the

116
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,909
approach I think that the approach drove

117
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,740
the result and allowed us to do

118
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,170
something unprecedented and and we want

119
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,060
to continue to do that and and we felt

120
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:59,390
that we made a significant contribution

121
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,189
to medical cannabis policy in the state

122
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:02,839
of California we knew it wasn't perfect

123
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:05,060
when you do something that big it's

124
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,619
impossible to get it right just right

125
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,290
but to get it perfect it's gonna have

126
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,060
unintended consequences it's gonna have

127
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,400
components that that are intend to do

128
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,230
one thing but don't accomplish that

129
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,239
there'll be some blind spots that get

130
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,740
revealed where you expected it to do

131
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,970
something but it's something else kind

132
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,590
of squeezed out the side and then you

133
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,510
gotta be committed to the ongoing work

134
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:27,349
to fix those challenges and we have and

135
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:31,180
we a big part of that is you you know

136
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:35,860
you're the experts you're on the ground

137
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:39,530
you know how the law impacts you impacts

138
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,900
businesses patients the environment so

139
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:43,519
that feedback loop is critical to us and

140
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,929
a lot of legislators say we want to hear

141
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,500
from you and we really want to hear from

142
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,259
you to share with us what's needed next

143
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,899
in the next iteration to you know move

144
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,459
towards perfection of our cannabis

145
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:58,099
policy in the state of California I came

146
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:59,599
at this from a certain perspective I was

147
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,620
chair of the assembly Health Committee

148
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,750
at the time I've been on the assembly

149
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,030
Health Committee my entire time in the

150
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,149
legislature I saw this as an important

151
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:10,779
issue for patients that that that voters

152
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:14,089
for whom voters had approved access to

153
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:15,639
cannabis as medicine and I wanted to

154
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:17,719
make sure that that was high quality

155
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,680
medicine that it was tested that it was

156
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,260
reliable that those with compromised

157
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,060
immune systems weren't put at risk and I

158
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:29,209
also came at it as a representative from

159
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:32,899
Oakland who as you know there are many

160
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:36,709
pioneering cannabis leaders from my city

161
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:39,859
and and so I wanted to work with others

162
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:42,500
to try to get the right policy but but

163
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,150
you know this wasn't something that when

164
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,069
I ran for the legislature back in 2012 I

165
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:49,739
thought I would be working on

166
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:52,649
I'm proud and glad I have but really

167
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:58,620
relies on being the next policy

168
00:06:52,649 --> 00:07:00,929
components rely rely on you and so fast

169
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:06,269
forward one year from fall of 2015 and

170
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:09,360
fall of 2016 and in literally a year we

171
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:13,918
get the M CRS a past and then we get

172
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,770
prop 64 past and and so we're a year

173
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,509
before we didn't have any medical

174
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:22,079
cannabis regulations and adult use

175
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:24,060
cannabis I was not legal now both are in

176
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:28,139
effect and so that's a lot of movement

177
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,930
in a short period of time and the prop

178
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:36,350
64 was based on them CRS a but it had

179
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:41,009
some noted departures from our work and

180
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:42,600
I supported prop 64 as well and you know

181
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:44,550
definitely I there I do have pride of

182
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,280
ownership but not that much pride I was

183
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,530
I was I was fine with the overall

184
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,728
approach and I think prop 64 brought a

185
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:56,038
lot of people behind it whether it be

186
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:58,379
you know patient advocates or those in

187
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,000
the industry themselves or social

188
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,219
justice folks criminal justice reform

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,319
folks folks who believe that what it was

190
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,229
that the war on drugs was a failure and

191
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,370
it needed to be fixed and addressed and

192
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:10,379
there needed to be some changes going

193
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,439
forward and and that brought a lot of

194
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,629
libertarian folks who thought that the

195
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,829
government shouldn't be deciding whether

196
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,930
or not you can use adult use cannabis

197
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:21,269
since you're an adult and and and the

198
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,978
the election showed that the the numbers

199
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:26,009
were strong was 57 percent throughout

200
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:28,740
the state of California and and so now

201
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,909
we have adult use pass as well and we've

202
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,650
been trying to roll out the regulations

203
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,259
every year I'll be working with the

204
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:36,870
bureau we've been always trying to

205
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:40,110
improve and strengthen and build on the

206
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:43,560
work that we we got done with MCA RSA

207
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,360
and and prop 64 I have a bill that's

208
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,338
right now on the governor's desk that

209
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,200
would help speed up the process for

210
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:54,120
expungements and reductions in cannabis

211
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,040
crimes thank you

212
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,840
maybe the panel beforehand was talking

213
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,839
about that and other issues I know

214
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,310
but you know my view is this is a

215
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,200
substantive right that was given by prop

216
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:08,489
60 for the people of California voted by

217
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:13,230
a supermajority that not only going

218
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:15,539
forward will cannabis be legal but that

219
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,460
it has a retroactive impact and and it

220
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:20,879
should be able to it should change your

221
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,920
criminal record and that that conviction

222
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,299
that had been haunting you and chasing

223
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:26,099
you and following you around and making

224
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:27,870
it difficult to get housing and make it

225
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,820
difficult to get a job you should no

226
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,279
longer have to deal with that but the

227
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:38,100
process is burdensome it's confusing

228
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:39,419
it's costly its time-consuming and a lot

229
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,129
of folks aren't taking advantage of it

230
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,839
because of those reasons because they

231
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:46,259
need to take a day off from work and go

232
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:49,110
to court and file papers and maybe have

233
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,610
a lawyer and they need it for they need

234
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,740
to even know that the right is theirs

235
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,600
that it's something that that they enjoy

236
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,220
and they can pursue and I think this is

237
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,899
somewhere where government should be

238
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,139
able to step in this is sort of a

239
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,579
classic good government role where the

240
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:03,960
right is already it's already been

241
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,259
decided that individuals deserve this

242
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,840
right now now make it so and use the the

243
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,879
power of government use use that use the

244
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,950
fact that the DOJ has a database where

245
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:17,460
they can search for all of the

246
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:20,009
qualifying cannabis crimes and they can

247
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,360
do a data dump literally and provide it

248
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:23,370
to the district attorneys who can have a

249
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,560
chance to review them and challenge them

250
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,049
if they like and if they don't then

251
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,479
these crimes should be wiped or reduced

252
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:34,109
and that should all just be done by

253
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,879
operation of law and so the governor has

254
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,320
a few more days to sign this bill I'm

255
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,450
getting nervous because it's not because

256
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,720
he has to the end of the month and he

257
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:47,000
hasn't done it yet but I think he sort

258
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,800
of takes he dresses bills in in sort of

259
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,049
thematic groups and so maybe he hasn't

260
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,250
addressed all of the cannabis bills yet

261
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:56,129
but I'm but I'm very hopeful for that

262
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,419
one that one is is it's a bill that got

263
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:59,759
a lot of support including support from

264
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,169
law enforcement folks and others and I

265
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,700
think it's just it's a bill that will

266
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:03,959
really help achieve social justice it'll

267
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,050
show that government can work for the

268
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,519
people and it'll it'll make people's

269
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:10,539
lives better who are hurting because of

270
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,399
these these convictions and so

271
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:13,629
I'm proud of that bill and I hope it

272
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,049
gets signed by the governor so I got my

273
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:19,059
fingers crossed

274
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:21,069
thank you you know we also I want to

275
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:22,179
give a shout out to Fiona ma I know she

276
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,030
may have been here earlier or may be

277
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:26,109
coming but we worked for a number of

278
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,459
years together first of all I'm a big

279
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,980
supporter of her she's gonna be our next

280
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,570
treasurer she's forward-thinking and

281
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,180
open-minded and she embraces the

282
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,760
cannabis industry and wants to create

283
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:38,469
better solutions and make the system

284
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:43,149
work and she and I have been in

285
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:45,519
particular that's worked together and we

286
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:47,230
wanted to do something that I thought

287
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,329
was practical and simple we set about to

288
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,120
do it last year which was to take away

289
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:56,259
that 10 percent penalty on the non EFT

290
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,799
tax payments because the cannabis

291
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:01,600
industry can't pay through electronic

292
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:06,639
fund transfer given the the federal

293
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,519
overlay and the the cash bit business or

294
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,230
the all-cash nature of the business so

295
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,879
that bill actually we tried again this

296
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,250
year and that bill is signed it's the

297
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,620
law there's no more 10% penalty for

298
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,779
paying tax payments in cash I think that

299
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,340
provides equity and fairness it

300
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:23,350
encourages our cannabis businesses to

301
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,580
pay their taxes which is a good thing

302
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,550
from from the perspective of the

303
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,720
government and businesses so we got that

304
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:31,089
bill passed and we're excited about that

305
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,180
one that I regret we didn't get passed

306
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:37,210
which I really feel was necessary and

307
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:38,739
I'm open to seeing how we address it

308
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:42,879
going forward but was that was the

309
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,100
three-year reduction in excise taxes and

310
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,360
and a complete moratorium on the

311
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:52,149
cultivation tax we're we're in a time of

312
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,509
transformation right now you know with

313
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:58,120
with laws going into effect in in

314
00:12:54,509 --> 00:13:02,740
January of this year and the new regime

315
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,480
being implemented we wanted to encourage

316
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,009
as many folks as possible to move from

317
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,750
the black and gray market to the

318
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:11,019
regulated market that's what this whole

319
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:13,679
proposition was the proposition of of

320
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:18,129
the MC RSA the the proposition of

321
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:20,559
proposition 64 it said come out of the

322
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:22,299
shadows come into the light embrace a

323
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,399
regulated marketplace where you follow

324
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:26,759
all the rules

325
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,230
and if you do you'll be a business just

326
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,860
like any other California businesses

327
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,909
creating good jobs paying your taxes and

328
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,269
for being fully compliant with the law

329
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:37,740
and in order to do that we need to make

330
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:38,909
sure that our businesses aren't undercut

331
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,820
by the gray and black market where

332
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:43,500
they're where they're not paying their

333
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,700
taxes whether we're there

334
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,350
they're undercutting based on cost

335
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,520
savings because of because of the cost

336
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,100
of compliance that they're not following

337
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,360
and in order to do that for temporary

338
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,450
period for three years I thought it made

339
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,759
sense to reduce the taxes too to invite

340
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,680
and encourage and spur along that

341
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,669
migration from the black and gray market

342
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:07,859
to the to the regulator marketplace but

343
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:11,099
not all of my colleagues agreed and it's

344
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,300
a it's a legislature with it with

345
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,680
multiple branches of government multiple

346
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,879
members in the legislature not a

347
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,528
monarchy and we weren't able to get that

348
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,000
done what I was excited about was that

349
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:20,129
was a bipartisan effort Assemblymember

350
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,659
Tom Lackey was the co-author along with

351
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:25,139
me we got a good amount of support along

352
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:26,819
the way in committee and it got held in

353
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,039
in appropriations on the assembly side

354
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,990
so maybe we try again on that or maybe

355
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,659
we sharpen our pencils and roll up our

356
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,000
sleeves and decide a better way to do it

357
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:37,230
a more effective way to do it but you

358
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,278
know in the discussion part of this I'd

359
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,580
love to hear what your thoughts are on

360
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:44,549
that bill and and and what the future

361
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:47,209
might hold one other thing that the

362
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:50,729
legislature wasn't ready yet for yet was

363
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:55,919
protection of medical patients in the

364
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:57,720
workplace I was ready for it I I think

365
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:03,000
it makes it's common sense it's

366
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:05,580
practical that a medical cannabis

367
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,490
patient like any patient using medicine

368
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,230
should have their status as a medical

369
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,278
patient protected and should be

370
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:16,680
reasonably accommodated obviously if we

371
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,088
had some components in there where you

372
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,338
know in safety sensitive jobs it

373
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:21,600
wouldn't apply and and and this is an

374
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,279
area where the state of California would

375
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,830
not be the first to do this other states

376
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,350
have done it including red states and so

377
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:31,259
we need to catch up and we need to do

378
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,329
better by our employees because right

379
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,769
now the incentive is to not use cannabis

380
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:37,019
and instead to use things like opioids

381
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:39,259
which we know we have an opioid

382
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:45,539
epidemic and that cannabis can be a

383
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:46,528
safer healthier alternative so what that

384
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:48,120
tells me is that while we've made

385
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:51,480
progress while we're we've moved the

386
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,649
needle while our trajectory is heading

387
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,820
in the right direction where we're not

388
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,100
able to do everything that's necessary

389
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,690
yet and I think sometimes it's

390
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,730
incremental sometimes there's a there's

391
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:04,410
a time and a place for for each policy

392
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:06,149
and maybe this year wasn't the time for

393
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:08,429
that but but but maybe next year we'll

394
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:13,649
be and so we have to continue our

395
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:14,849
efforts and you know meanwhile we're

396
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,278
dealing with a federal administration

397
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:20,278
that's tough on cannabis that makes it

398
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,350
harder to make the progress that we that

399
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,750
we need you know I always thought that

400
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:28,759
maybe with a different president we'd

401
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:34,500
have a rescheduling or addi scheduling

402
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:36,870
that we'd have more openness to to what

403
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,200
states are doing and in deference to

404
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,959
states rights more along the lines of

405
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,390
the Cole memo but even more and instead

406
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,250
of a you know a retraction of the Cole

407
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:50,819
memo which is what we have and an

408
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:53,549
attorney general who is hostile towards

409
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,629
cannabis so the federal overlay it makes

410
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:58,469
things tougher and the schedule one

411
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:59,730
nature of the drug in the eyes of the

412
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,470
federal government makes it tough and

413
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,019
and so does the fact that there's no

414
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,449
banking that makes it very difficult for

415
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:10,318
our businesses to be to be successful

416
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:13,709
and to thrive so for sure choppy waters

417
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,959
ahead challenges ahead but my reflection

418
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:19,350
is the the appetite of the California

419
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,600
Legislature is is growing to be

420
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,308
supportive to be open-minded to try to

421
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,469
craft solutions to try to fix problems

422
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,178
in the cannabis space to build on what

423
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,589
we've done with a lot of

424
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,720
self-recognition that we didn't get it

425
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,609
exactly right that it's not perfect that

426
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,850
it needs to be improved and the way to

427
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:38,250
improve it is through the input of you

428
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:39,959
you know you literally telling me and

429
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,750
some member jones-sawyer and assembly

430
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:46,289
member wood and Lackey and Cooley what

431
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,609
needs to be done next so I'd love to

432
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:50,059
have our discussion include some of that

433
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:51,589
if you have some ideas about what

434
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,179
what California who prides itself in

435
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:55,159
leading on so many things and I think we

436
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,769
are leading on cannabis what else we

437
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,070
need to do to sort of cement that role

438
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:02,269
as as leaders in the cannabis space so I

439
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:05,929
want to thank you for all that you do I

440
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:07,400
know it hasn't always been easy to be in

441
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,160
in the cannabis world

442
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,240
I think it's hopefully it's getting

443
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,009
easier although the regulated

444
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,039
marketplace is not something I guess

445
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:18,109
you'd put you put the label easy on but

446
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,940
it is but it I feel like it is necessary

447
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:21,829
when we want to support our good actors

448
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,240
and and it's bringing as many people

449
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:26,119
into the regulated marketplace as

450
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,940
possible and sort of sort of shed that

451
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,009
stigma for good and keep working and

452
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,809
building on on creating a more perfect

453
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:35,119
cannabis policy in the state of

454
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,859
California so with that I'll end my

455
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,119
remarks and just say thank you for the

456
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:39,829
opportunity to be here with you thank

457
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:41,059
you for this state of cannabis

458
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:43,549
conference I was here a couple years ago

459
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:45,139
and seems like it's growing and and and

460
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:48,049
we're always getting better thought

461
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,400
partners and engagement and look forward

462
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,470
to your questions into our discussion

463
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:57,380
thank you

464
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:57,380
[Applause]

465
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:04,059
homeland security issue that happened

466
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:09,549
with the transportation company two

467
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:13,720
weeks ago jr. about that so wild rivers

468
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:15,490
transport was taking some cash somewhere

469
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,480
that it needed to go and they got pulled

470
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,160
over by CHP and then they got they let

471
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,110
them go and then further down the road

472
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,700
Homeland Security came and got him and

473
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:30,579
took their cash and now they've retained

474
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,559
Matt cumin and they're they're suing CHP

475
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:35,409
so you said there that you know we've

476
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,269
got some issues federally have you heard

477
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:40,269
about this workaround with Homeland

478
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:42,369
Security apparently isn't held to

479
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:46,029
Rohrabacher far so there's some money

480
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:48,879
there to come and do some enforcement

481
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:51,399
have you heard about this you know we

482
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,170
had a bill that I think would have

483
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,810
helped with that and this is where I

484
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:57,370
need max back in my office

485
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,839
Assemblymember jones-sawyer we were it

486
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:02,889
was sort of a almost like a sanctuary

487
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:04,929
state approach to to cannabis we're in a

488
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,970
place where like California where we

489
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:11,920
legalized medical and adult use cannabis

490
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:14,759
there would not be that ability to sort

491
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,130
of refer or tip off or communicate with

492
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,720
the federal government because it's

493
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,950
legal in the state of California similar

494
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,250
to what we've done with our sanctuary

495
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,860
state for our undocumented friends and

496
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:29,200
neighbors and and and and immigrant

497
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,169
residents so maybe something like that

498
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,440
would help address something like this

499
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:37,120
the the problem is is something that

500
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,340
well hard to hear is not shocking from

501
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,469
the federal administration and it might

502
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:44,289
be something that is susceptible to a

503
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,579
state fix along the lines of the Joan

504
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:47,889
Sawyer bill that I was working on with

505
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:50,139
him last year one thing I'd like you to

506
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,660
address is I haven't heard much talk on

507
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,370
is our friends at the League of Cities

508
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,470
sending out a thing you're gonna have to

509
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:58,899
ban or you're gonna leave your lose your

510
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,269
rights to control it and this the state

511
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:04,300
is going to control it and now some

512
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:07,789
ungodly number of municipalities and

513
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:10,399
counties and so forth have complete bans

514
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:13,309
is there something at the state level

515
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,550
that might go I think we've learned that

516
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:20,750
it's way way easier to ban than to unban

517
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:23,299
and you know now with 80% of the cities

518
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,690
and counties having bans how does the

519
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:29,899
state legislature look at that and is

520
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,940
there any help fix other than the

521
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,820
regular thing of you know changing

522
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:40,009
hearts and minds one of the the key

523
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:45,669
components of the MSR CRS a that allowed

524
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:48,619
it to pass and it was part of sort of

525
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:51,980
the grand deal and the grand bargain and

526
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:54,379
then later was adopted more or less by

527
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,569
prop 64 was this idea of local control

528
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,470
so the League of California cities had

529
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:02,389
had traditionally been able to oppose

530
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,940
legislation that did not have strong

531
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:08,750
local control components and and and

532
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,880
those bills died and so we believed that

533
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,099
that in putting the MC rs8 together in

534
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,710
2015 we would not be able to get a bill

535
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:18,349
passed and signed by the governor if it

536
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:21,890
didn't have a local control component

537
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:23,649
and I think that's an absolutely

538
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,570
accurate assessment it's not guesswork

539
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,740
you know they would have the league

540
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:28,909
would have gone strong opposed law

541
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,450
enforcement would've gone strong opposed

542
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:36,590
and legislators would have followed so

543
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:39,769
we would have had nothing there was also

544
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:43,459
a component in there that we had to fix

545
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:46,700
when we came back in 2016 which was very

546
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,430
unfortunate because it was unintended it

547
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:54,529
got into the language and it helps spur

548
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:56,840
this sort of urgent call out to locals

549
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:58,369
to to BAM because they thought they were

550
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,509
gonna get preempted by the state and the

551
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:01,969
state was gonna act for them if they

552
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:06,170
didn't act and so that was unintended

553
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:07,250
that's part of the when you know when we

554
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,600
do something this big you don't get it

555
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,390
up always get it right into some

556
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:14,179
imperfections that one had consequences

557
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,710
and and when people decided to ban it's

558
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,090
hard to reverse it's better when you

559
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,190
start from a place of no action and you

560
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:20,139
can decide a course either their ban or

561
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,950
adopt

562
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:26,790
I think what we might be able to do and

563
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:29,710
so this is a huge issue right

564
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:31,450
we have don't use cannabis we have state

565
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,890
licenses but then we have a lot of

566
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:37,539
places that are banning all or some of

567
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,310
the supply chain in a cannabis

568
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:42,730
marketplace a lot or nervous about

569
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:47,049
dispensaries maybe more okay with

570
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:49,120
manufacturers or testers maybe even

571
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:50,919
cultivators but with a little more

572
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,659
worried about dispensaries and so this

573
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,269
sort of the full supply chain in the

574
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,860
marketplace that's needed is not robust

575
00:23:55,269 --> 00:24:01,029
enough and and so we've had a number of

576
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:02,679
sort of roundtables to think about what

577
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:06,149
the solution is to that you know one

578
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:09,820
thought I had was it's weird if a

579
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:12,190
locality if the people have voted to

580
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:13,899
have adult use cannabis but their

581
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,090
representatives their City Council or

582
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,850
their supervisors say we should have a

583
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:24,669
ban that seems like a you know attention

584
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:28,269
a problem a conflict prop 64 to be fair

585
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:31,360
and mtrs a did say that locals could ban

586
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:33,009
and so so maybe that's the way that gets

587
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:37,839
harmonized and the eyes of those folks

588
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:39,309
but I think one of the things I had

589
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:45,549
thought of was also having a sort of

590
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:47,139
model template for locate locals to use

591
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:48,339
so they like I think people get

592
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,870
overwhelmed like I don't know anything

593
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:50,919
about cannabis I'm a city council member

594
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:52,089
I came because I would cared about

595
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,070
public safety or I cared about

596
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:57,099
development projects or I cared about

597
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:59,049
parks cannabis is new to me it's just

598
00:24:57,099 --> 00:25:00,639
easier if I just ban it like some of my

599
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:02,259
neighbors are kind of worried about it

600
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,610
and I don't have to deal with them when

601
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:06,339
I go to the supermarket or the soccer

602
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:07,629
sidelines at the soccer field those are

603
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:09,639
all real examples for me when I was in

604
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,560
the City Council not not being afraid

605
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,509
but seeing people in the supermarket and

606
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:15,159
on the sidelines at the soccer field and

607
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:16,839
so easier to ban but if they had

608
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,450
something that said this is what the

609
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:22,000
state proposes as a good solid model

610
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,400
template that you can adjust and tweak

611
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,779
and make it work for you but it but it

612
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,750
addresses some of the key issues that

613
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:30,490
highlights the the key components of

614
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,230
what you might have so that they can

615
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,430
have a starting place and they could

616
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,839
work with their attorne their city

617
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:37,600
attorney and their

618
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:40,148
to get it right you know that's so this

619
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,099
idea of providing tools to locals to

620
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:44,018
help them get there because I feel like

621
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:47,678
they get overwhelmed and I know that

622
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:49,740
there are some efforts you know max I

623
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,169
guess this is this is the maxilla

624
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,460
keynote but max has been working on had

625
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:57,159
been working with a number of locals on

626
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:02,230
on just that you know getting into place

627
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:04,269
a regime and that supported it had the

628
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:06,159
right safeguards and and guardrails

629
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:07,599
around cannabis and maybe that's

630
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,210
something that could be helpful as well

631
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:13,689
but it's we're in a tough spot because

632
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:15,610
it requires reversal of bans right again

633
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,929
if we if we had no position instead of a

634
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:19,868
banned position it would have been

635
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:21,159
easier but I am open in and you know

636
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:23,378
we've we've pulled together some people

637
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,330
some of our thought leaders in cannabis

638
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:28,269
policy in Sacramento to talk about this

639
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:31,480
don't know that we've exactly figured it

640
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:32,769
out but I think that's an area that

641
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,269
needs to get addressed and we need to do

642
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:36,579
something in the next legislative cycle

643
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:37,028
so if you have thoughts or others have

644
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:39,009
thoughts

645
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:41,079
that's something the problem is on our

646
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:44,349
radar the solution is it's not something

647
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:46,599
that where we've arrived at yet hello my

648
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:51,579
name is Alfonso I'm a Content producer

649
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:56,138
and I am looking to get a public service

650
00:26:51,579 --> 00:27:02,319
announcement campaign where social

651
00:26:56,138 --> 00:27:05,829
equity and a more accessible industry

652
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:09,069
for for people now is that something

653
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:11,999
where you could assist in directing me

654
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:15,609
and getting some feedback and maybe

655
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:19,600
getting those ideas to certain areas

656
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:22,569
like in Los Angeles or up north or down

657
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:27,609
in in those areas that where that

658
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:29,618
message might be best received happy to

659
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:31,148
talk to you further I mean this is a

660
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:34,048
component that kind of animates the

661
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:37,118
whole cannabis industry this idea of

662
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:39,398
equity and social justice and providing

663
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:43,408
opportunity to particularly those

664
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:45,219
communities that have been harmed by the

665
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:47,110
prior

666
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:50,259
approach and policies towards cannabis

667
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:52,479
and we're working on things at the state

668
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:55,359
level to help address that on the

669
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,519
regulatory side as well I know the

670
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,299
bureau and Laurie Ajax's are is working

671
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,150
on some things we've had some

672
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:02,680
roundtables about that we have a bill

673
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:05,890
that would provide 10 million dollars to

674
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:10,950
support equity coming from the state

675
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:14,320
we've had ideas around incubators and

676
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:16,059
sort of this idea of a golden ticket if

677
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,509
you if you go through an incubator and

678
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:21,369
you take certain steps and you're from a

679
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:22,480
community a disadvantaged community that

680
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:26,409
has that have been harmed in the past

681
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,660
you would be able to have more direct

682
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:31,000
access to it to a license

683
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,279
Oakland's done a lot on equity maybe

684
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,579
gone a little too far in some ways but

685
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,809
this the spirit is right so you know I'm

686
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:40,629
right in the heart of kind of this

687
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:42,549
equity discussion in Oakland and and I'm

688
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,350
happy to talk to you more about it hey

689
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:45,909
hi Assemblymember Bonta first of all

690
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:48,990
thank you for all of the work you've

691
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:52,000
done max of course and and all the other

692
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:55,089
legislators it hasn't gone unnoticed we

693
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,269
know where you played a role in this so

694
00:28:55,089 --> 00:29:00,639
thank you so god there's just so many

695
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:02,500
fixes that need to happen in in the pin

696
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,480
policy and the regulation side and all

697
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,519
of it so instead I want to look a little

698
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,620
into the future and ask you what your

699
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:10,569
thoughts are on public consumption we

700
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:12,789
have an issue even here at this event we

701
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:14,889
have issues everywhere with people out

702
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:16,869
smoking tobacco right and they can't

703
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:19,600
smoke cannabis out again of his event

704
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:21,489
and it's not just here it's anywhere I

705
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,469
mean it sounds like a little bit of a

706
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,900
progressive policy but by some token

707
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,990
it's working in Canada right in Canada

708
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,970
if your medical card holder you can

709
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,230
smoke right on the street now people

710
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,660
hopefully can be responsible about it

711
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,579
but nevertheless that is available and I

712
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,410
and do you are you guys looking into

713
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:40,059
that at all is that too far down the

714
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,680
road or do you think that California

715
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:43,839
could eventually come around where we

716
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,740
could somehow figure out a safe way to

717
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,079
have public consumption

718
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,539
despite the lounges that may open in

719
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:52,059
cities right just for everybody for my

720
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:55,210
crystal ball if I looked into it today

721
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:57,579
I'd say probably not next year I think

722
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,630
it's it's a number it's it it's it's an

723
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:01,449
iterative process

724
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:04,750
well you need to take one step and then

725
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:07,360
take another step to get there it'll

726
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:10,089
prop 64 did not allow for that and so

727
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:13,389
part of what voters just voted on

728
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:17,470
included not having the the public

729
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:19,509
consumption a that you refer to but we

730
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:24,220
have the Assemblymember bill quirk bill

731
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:25,900
which allows for use in more areas and

732
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:29,079
again there's a local control component

733
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:31,600
if the local if the city agrees on it

734
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:37,329
and I think I think people need to see

735
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:39,609
that use can occur beyond sort of

736
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:41,439
personal use in your home and can occur

737
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:43,449
in certain at certain events for special

738
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,490
events and see that the world keeps

739
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,569
turning in the sky doesn't fall and then

740
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,750
you do a little bit more and then the

741
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:51,129
same thing happens but if you go in one

742
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,019
big step all the way to public

743
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,330
consumption then you know the fear

744
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:57,668
monger has come out and the horror

745
00:30:55,329 --> 00:31:02,859
stories come out and I think it's a

746
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:05,409
little bit harder so I think it's a few

747
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:07,829
years away I thank you so much for

748
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:09,850
coming here you've raised so many

749
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:13,058
important points I want to just raise

750
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:17,439
two first of all taxes as a cannon

751
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:20,259
longtime cannabis patient I'm losing my

752
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,580
patience with being charged an

753
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:25,359
exorbitant

754
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:29,019
syntax for a medicine that I actually

755
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:31,269
really need I do not do sales in the

756
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:33,879
black buy product from the black market

757
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:36,429
anymore but I'm one of those people and

758
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,340
I'm a longtime a cannabis trade

759
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:41,890
journalist in this industry but I can't

760
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:44,109
afford it anymore so I'm going to be I'm

761
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,880
gonna go back to narcotics or black

762
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:49,329
market or nothing or something like that

763
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,299
so and I'm kind of so upset about it

764
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:55,658
that I may become a full-time consumer

765
00:31:52,298 --> 00:31:58,629
activist on this subject because that

766
00:31:55,659 --> 00:32:02,110
the tax regime the patchwork the

767
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:04,150
layering on affects the entire food

768
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:07,178
chain in the entire cannabis market I

769
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,519
just wanted to say that as a comment but

770
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:12,310
I'm wanting to ask you about what is

771
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,529
called an extinction event

772
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:17,589
people have used that term in California

773
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:20,379
I believe that California's cannabis

774
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:22,750
legacy is in great part tied up in the

775
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,150
future of the North Cal region I've

776
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,940
spent a lot of time up there talking to

777
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,890
farmers covering it and you know when

778
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,740
people talk about an extinction event

779
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:36,160
it's like a really serious term and I'm

780
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:38,650
curious what goes through your mind when

781
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,900
you hear that and I'm also curious if

782
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,990
you have a sense of where the

783
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:46,780
legislature in general is at with the

784
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:48,519
idea that this entire region may go

785
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:50,649
through what is being called an

786
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,619
extinction event or what BDS analytics

787
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:55,330
says will be three extinction events and

788
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:57,399
I'm curious what you think about that

789
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:58,869
and also what the solutions are I

790
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,700
believe there was just a bill that would

791
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:04,119
have allowed farmers markets that wound

792
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:06,220
up in suspense and so there seem to be

793
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:09,909
solutions that will help those farmers

794
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:12,910
help that region help the future of this

795
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:14,320
state and California's legacy two great

796
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:17,279
points let me take the the first one

797
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:19,149
first about medical patients and taxes

798
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,549
you know that's kind of where my heart

799
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:26,530
has always been in this discussion is

800
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:28,990
with patients and you know with someone

801
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:30,940
dealing with chronic pain or or a child

802
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,079
dealing with seizures and and making

803
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,529
sure that they have access to the

804
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:38,859
medicine that helps them and makes them

805
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:40,180
you know feel better and and addresses

806
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:42,849
their their their symptoms and their

807
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:45,700
challenges and so to the extent that we

808
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:48,759
have a tax regime that makes it

809
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,410
difficult for those patients to to

810
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,809
receive them at the medicine medicine

811
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:55,450
they need I'm very open-minded to making

812
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:57,549
changes and taking action that can help

813
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,900
ensure that I think there is I mean I

814
00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:02,159
think there's a sales tax exemption

815
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,160
right for card holders

816
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:10,250
right right so yeah it's something but

817
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:13,608
it's not it's not a lot I mean the

818
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,358
extinction event that worries me that's

819
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:16,098
disturbing

820
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:18,348
that makes me anxious that's not

821
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:22,760
something that we ever wanted or an or

822
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:24,859
intended I don't know if it's true but

823
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,909
the fact that it's being discussed is a

824
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:32,389
problem and you know we always wanted

825
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:36,740
folks who had been longtime members of

826
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:39,440
the industry who operated in in in the

827
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:42,289
great gray spaces because California

828
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,139
hadn't yet regulated or made it lawful

829
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:46,398
to be able to migrate to the to the

830
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,588
regulated marketplace to the lawful

831
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,289
marketplace to be able to embrace that

832
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:52,250
marketplace and be successful

833
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:54,829
participant in it for many years to come

834
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,719
that was always the idea and that was

835
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:59,150
the intent and you know the the mom and

836
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,139
pops the small farms the the growers

837
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:04,970
that had been there for multi

838
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:07,670
generations yeah yes and so so the fact

839
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:09,679
that that's a that that's that we're

840
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,019
dealing with that makes me want to talk

841
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:15,409
to you more and and figure out what we

842
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:17,210
can do to avoid it so I'll stay

843
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:19,368
afterwards I'll give you my card and

844
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,990
this is the time when we're preparing

845
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:23,630
our legislative package this is the time

846
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:25,309
when we're actively soliciting input and

847
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:28,460
ideas and then we introduce our bills

848
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:31,159
early next year so I want to learn more

849
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:35,059
from you thank you may be related to the

850
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:36,769
extinction concept if banking is not

851
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:39,259
available

852
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:41,929
typically what goes on is those

853
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:44,829
businesses with larger resources and

854
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:49,519
larger contacts are able to get by and

855
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:52,039
small businesses without banking just

856
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,440
disappear and get crushed there was some

857
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:57,469
discussion this morning about banking

858
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,480
the only way most likely way that gets

859
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:01,730
resolved in California is that the

860
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,010
federal issue has to get resolved and

861
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:07,190
there's pretty much no way forward other

862
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:09,260
than that I'm wondering if you agree if

863
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:11,210
you think there are any other pathways

864
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,680
to resolving particularly for small

865
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,659
business people in California

866
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,149
for it to get banking support and be

867
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:21,500
able to use banks in development of a

868
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,500
business which is required

869
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:27,870
III don't know if the federal fix is the

870
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,920
only fix but for a long time I've said

871
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:33,469
that's the best way we're going to

872
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:36,030
address this and we have tried and and

873
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:40,079
scratched our heads and put pen to paper

874
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:42,480
and and a mad imagine and reimagined

875
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,920
other possibilities you know credit

876
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,900
unions I know

877
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,789
soon-to-be treasurer of Fiona Maas been

878
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,769
working on this current Treasurer John

879
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,360
Chung has been working on this Senator

880
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:56,099
Hertzberg and I had a bill working on

881
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:58,050
this this past year I'm open to the

882
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:00,839
possibility of a creative fix to it but

883
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:03,600
I don't know what it is and I think the

884
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,250
the best way the cleanest way the most

885
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,679
impactful way is for the federal

886
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,929
government to act and so you know that

887
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:13,289
that's not easy to hear right now given

888
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:14,639
the constitution of the federal

889
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:18,809
government and who's sitting in those

890
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,889
those decision-making seats but it

891
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:21,929
doesn't mean that that's what the future

892
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:22,440
holds it doesn't mean that things might

893
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:23,909
change

894
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,059
you know this November and they might

895
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:30,089
change again in two years so you know

896
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:32,009
real change could be two years away in

897
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:36,480
an ideal world but that doesn't create

898
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:38,700
any comfort right now but I've always

899
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,740
felt that the federal government has to

900
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:46,649
act to really make it clean and to

901
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:49,199
provide the protections that businesses

902
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:51,599
deserve having said that I don't know

903
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,799
all the answers and if you or others

904
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,329
that you're working with have a proposal

905
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,120
that you think could work in the state

906
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:58,319
of California I'm all ears and and and

907
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,109
if that can provide relief to businesses

908
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,590
that need it faster then I think we

909
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:06,180
should try state-owned public banking

910
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:08,550
what do you think about doing a public

911
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:11,069
bank for California which I think would

912
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:13,050
be a way to like circumvent the federal

913
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:16,830
restrictions in terms of getting banking

914
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:18,870
and banking cannabis businesses cannabis

915
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:20,460
growers what do you think about the idea

916
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:23,929
of doing a California statewide

917
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:26,429
public bank I think the statewide bank

918
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:28,349
idea is a good one generally I think

919
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:32,489
it's trick

920
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:33,960
and you know I think people who don't

921
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:36,419
know about South Dakota or north dakota

922
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,820
I think folks point to North Dakota a

923
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,940
lot smaller and a lot different than in

924
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:46,769
California and even if we had a bank

925
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:48,300
that that allowed cannabis proceeds and

926
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:50,759
revenue to be banked in it at the you

927
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,870
know a state bank doesn't get FDIC

928
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:57,330
insurance I think I think no maybe the

929
00:38:54,869 --> 00:39:01,259
state provides that that you know

930
00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:04,349
something similar in terms of that sort

931
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:07,170
of insurance or guarantee and then is it

932
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:08,339
is it susceptible to a federal raid and

933
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,019
saying you know these are all you know

934
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,850
the federal government in our eyes this

935
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:13,349
is all criminal enterprise the state of

936
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,690
California it might be might be state of

937
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:18,000
California bank but those revenues are

938
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:20,130
from in our eyes criminal enterprise and

939
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,289
we're gonna raid it and take it and it's

940
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:24,000
gonna be subject to forfeiture you know

941
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:25,619
I think that's something that this

942
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,530
president would would love the

943
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,639
opportunity to do but maybe there's ways

944
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:31,620
to protect it maybe there's ways around

945
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:35,639
it the state bank idea has come up many

946
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:37,980
times it's something that max has has

947
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:40,319
spent some time analyzing and looking at

948
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:44,280
others are as well if there's a way to

949
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,960
do it from a policy perspective then I

950
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,790
think I think again we should we should

951
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,490
try I think politically it's really

952
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:52,500
difficult the the rest of the banking

953
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:54,949
industry gets really nervous when when

954
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,389
the idea of a state bank gets brought up

955
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:58,769
so you know I was just curious if

956
00:39:57,389 --> 00:40:01,379
there's been any talk or anybody's

957
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:03,179
approached you around helping with some

958
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,579
legislation around the annual fees with

959
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:07,559
BCC you know we're looking at like a

960
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:10,319
hundred thousand dollar annual fee once

961
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:12,809
annual licenses become issued which you

962
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,980
know could be some time which could you

963
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:16,619
know move into the next legislative

964
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:18,090
session you know the idea that yes

965
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:19,739
you've got to recover costs because of

966
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,660
implementation

967
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:23,009
I feel like this first year I mean I

968
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:25,139
mean there's some talk that it will come

969
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:27,480
down because the you know it's not gonna

970
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:29,609
cost that much to continue regulation

971
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,369
but a hundred thousand annually is an

972
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,930
unbelievable amount of money even if we

973
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:36,210
do over two and a half million a year as

974
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:36,989
we do it's still just a very huge amount

975
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,579
of money and

976
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:39,989
to be paying an agency I mean you pay

977
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:41,400
that for a liquor license but you can

978
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:42,979
sell that liquor license in ten years

979
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,300
and I think we need let you know

980
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,500
legislation to to help operators make

981
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,060
that happen I'm just curious if you've

982
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,250
heard of anything or if you would

983
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:51,869
support that I've definitely heard of

984
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:54,329
that you know when we were talking about

985
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:56,789
taxes and sort of this this three year

986
00:40:54,329 --> 00:41:00,299
moratorium on the cultivation tax and

987
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:02,009
the reduction in the excise tax part of

988
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,800
the conversation included want to help

989
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,869
with the licensing fees those are very

990
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,289
burdensome as well and maybe some relief

991
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:12,090
there could help and so I think that's

992
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:14,309
an area where we can explore maybe that

993
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,869
may be because the the tax approach

994
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:19,440
didn't work this year maybe that the

995
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:21,059
licensing fee approach could could work

996
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,200
next year with with some reduction some

997
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:26,940
relief to our businesses I'm open to it

998
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,009
and and I think that that's that's an

999
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,970
area that we should explore and and see

1000
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:35,070
if we can make it work to help our

1001
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:37,099
responsible compliant businesses be

1002
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,100
successful

1003
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,318
thank you everybody appreciate it

1004
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:57,369
