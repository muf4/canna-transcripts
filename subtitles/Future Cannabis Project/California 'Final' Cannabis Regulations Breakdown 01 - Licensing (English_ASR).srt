2
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:14,699
coming from the philosophical background

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,368
I thought it might be fun to talk about

4
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,719
whether permanency is a valid concept in

5
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,960
relation to California cannabis

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,729
regulations considering that really in

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,910
the grand scheme of things this is just

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,039
another little tiny seed of evolution in

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,630
the process that's going to be dialing

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,840
in regulated cannabis in California this

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:40,940
is what we're we're at I mean to talk

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,640
about what has just happened is that on

13
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:48,390
Monday December 3rd the three major

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,789
agencies of California cannabis the BCC

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,079
Bureau of cannabis control the

16
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:58,460
Department of Public Health and the

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:01,558
Department of Food and Agriculture you

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:05,308
so there's no further public comments at

19
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:07,798
this time as many of you know we were

20
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:10,019
gonna have totally peaceful happy

21
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,000
holidays in blissful ignorance of what

22
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,739
the regulations were going to be they

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,079
weren't going to publicly share them

24
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,269
until after January when they became

25
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,329
active but they changed their mind

26
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:23,219
because you know a lot of people wanted

27
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:25,429
to know what it said so they could

28
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:29,929
prepare for when they become immediately

29
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:33,210
active as soon as the OAL approves them

30
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,920
so that is why we're doing this now

31
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,719
because now we know what it says so

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,099
we're starting to sort it out

33
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:43,438
the oal has 30 working days to review

34
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,359
the regulations that were submitted so

35
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,639
if they use that full time they have

36
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,438
until January 16th we're imagining it's

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,920
going to be about January 16th is when

38
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,898
they will become active and the role of

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,109
the oil is you don't know it's the

40
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,030
Office of Administrative Law is to

41
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:02,700
confirm that to the regulations proposed

42
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,000
by the agencies is actually in alignment

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,890
with statute with what was in what was

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,080
in mikasa what's in the business

45
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,449
professions code those things have to

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,800
align so there is a small possibility

47
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,719
that the OAL

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,300
find something that they decide is not

49
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,419
in alignment with Mikasa and and strike

50
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,280
things or reject them but there's not a

51
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:25,859
lot of anticipation of this happening

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,199
the general anticipation is that the

53
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,230
language is in there now is what we'll

54
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:33,139
have to deal with when in January when

55
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:37,439
it kicks in

56
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:39,419
until that time right now the emergency

57
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,030
regulations are still in effect and will

58
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:44,159
remain in effect until January 16th when

59
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,240
the new regulations take effect

60
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,289
immediately

61
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,659
upon adoption so there was lots of

62
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:53,459
adjustments lots of things that were

63
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:56,009
proposed it carried over we're gonna

64
00:02:53,460 --> 00:03:00,180
have Josh is gonna talk through a lot of

65
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:05,129
the things that impacted the licensing

66
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:08,790
aspect of those regulations so Josh

67
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:11,490
singer my person the presentation is

68
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,530
going to be a little bit of an update on

69
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,490
what's new for those of you who are

70
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,490
submitting licenses

71
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,900
starting with we're just gonna do a

72
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,830
quick overview of this is not exhaustive

73
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,080
this is just a number of the changes

74
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,440
that took place in this some of these

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,239
are actually we're first put in June

76
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,069
some of them were putting in October

77
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,739
most of these were not put in in the

78
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,810
most recent change but we're gonna talk

79
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,219
about them now that we it looks like

80
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,569
they're going to go into the permanent

81
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:47,520
regulations so I'm gonna do a quick

82
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:51,979
overview and then just go into more

83
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,570
detail on each of these first of all the

84
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:57,569
BCC decided that they did not like

85
00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:01,259
everyone submitting their own procedures

86
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:03,569
for review and instead has chosen to

87
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:07,189
create these forms these were initially

88
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:11,129
put together in the first round of

89
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:12,419
permanent regulations in June and now it

90
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,280
looks like they're going forward with it

91
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,608
it's not most of you I think know about

92
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,850
these but that's where they're going

93
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:22,500
number two they took out more recently

94
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,840
in October they took out the waste

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,339
management procedures so those of you

96
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,750
who have already prepared those for your

97
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,979
annual application it

98
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,670
doesn't look like they're going to be

99
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,220
going through those number three there

100
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,790
were some slight but significant changes

101
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,350
in the definitions of owner and in what

102
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,410
needs to be disclosed with your

103
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:46,140
financial interest holders number four

104
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,300
the license fees at least for the BCC

105
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:51,569
changed and thank God for that because

106
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,759
the previous licensing fees did not make

107
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,639
any sense

108
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,289
number five and I'm sure a lot of you

109
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,839
are very interested in this and want to

110
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,090
know more we're gonna go into a little

111
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,279
bit more detail on the expiration of

112
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:09,629
temporary licenses at least what we know

113
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:13,168
right now number six there are new OSHA

114
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:16,740
requirements for applications to all

115
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:18,779
three agencies and last with the CDFA

116
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,110
there's a very minor change in the

117
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:25,469
premises diagram requirements and in

118
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:30,090
pesticide requirements so let's go on

119
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,100
and talk a little bit about the forms we

120
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:34,619
put up the section up there just so

121
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,560
anybody who wants to look at this after

122
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,478
the presentation can take a look but the

123
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,310
basic idea is that they replace the

124
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,469
regulations regarding the procedures

125
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,709
that needed to be provided in the annual

126
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,960
application with forms instead of

127
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:51,509
everyone submitting separate procedures

128
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,978
for your non laboratory quality control

129
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:55,289
procedures your transportation

130
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,300
procedures all of these sets of

131
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,370
procedures that they previously asked in

132
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,050
the annual application instead of

133
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,360
creating your own and then having the

134
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,389
state get back to you and let you know

135
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,040
that they want this or that and whatever

136
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,860
it is they want those procedures they

137
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,810
created forums it would have been a lot

138
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,580
easier if they told us about these forms

139
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,860
for the very beginning but this is a

140
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:19,139
trial and error process for the state

141
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,790
agencies and this is how they're doing

142
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:26,899
it at least for BCC one thing to note

143
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:29,970
within these forms while the general

144
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:32,339
topics for the different forms are the

145
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,140
same as they were previously what

146
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:39,329
they're asking for in the forum's some

147
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:41,968
of them are surprises there are in clear

148
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:44,098
regulatory basis for what there

149
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:46,348
so you have to take a very close look at

150
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:48,620
those forms when we went through them

151
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:50,878
we'd noticed that there were some

152
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,370
subjects that it didn't occur to us

153
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,530
would have to be in the procedures and

154
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,959
they stick them in there so you have to

155
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:59,459
be careful a lot of people win think

156
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,318
that they have to submit certain things

157
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:04,560
in those forms and you do so read those

158
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,139
over carefully now for those of you who

159
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,819
previously submitted your procedures the

160
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,569
question is what do you do now that the

161
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:17,759
regulations changed so since these

162
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:19,528
original forms came out in June what

163
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,598
they did is initially they did not give

164
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:23,939
anybody bounce-backs asking you to fill

165
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,639
out the forms until the very end of

166
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:29,550
August we have a bunch of clients who

167
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,370
submitted way earlier who did not hear

168
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,990
anything about the forms there is no

169
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,269
question that you had to look back at

170
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,699
the forms or do anything after the very

171
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:40,258
end of August the state started telling

172
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,840
anybody who submitted annual

173
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,000
applications again from the BCC they

174
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:49,468
started asking you to refer to the forms

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,560
and they had this legalistic provision

176
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:54,838
in their letter that said wow we have

177
00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:00,718
not finalized the permanent regulations

178
00:07:54,838 --> 00:08:02,250
just yet we do want you to use the forms

179
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:05,819
as a framework for what you're

180
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,319
submitting to the BCC and we tried to

181
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,330
since many of our clients had already

182
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,550
submitted procedures we try to adjust

183
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:13,500
their procedures to just meet what was

184
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,478
in the forms but going forward you're

185
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,418
going to have to submit those forms in

186
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,620
the order that they ask so everyone keep

187
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:21,598
that for those of you who have not

188
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,218
submitted your annuals keep that in mind

189
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,139
for those of you who have submitted your

190
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:26,728
annuals but have not gotten any bounce

191
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,288
back you're also probably gonna have to

192
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:32,098
put them in the forms so get ready for

193
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:36,588
it moving on does anybody have questions

194
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,589
about the forms yes

195
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,469
so if you if you submitted about a month

196
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:51,629
ago

197
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,240
eventually I at least unless your

198
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:56,789
procedures are perfect I think and it's

199
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,320
very at least from what I've seen not

200
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:02,360
everybody who thinks that their

201
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,610
procedures are perfect they aren't but

202
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:09,509
yeah so you can download them online

203
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:13,019
they have it within the the package that

204
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:17,240
was released on the BCC website they

205
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,240
have the forms that they're downloadable

206
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:42,350
and JC Penney's for instance before you

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,350
could start working with them

208
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,009
right thank thanks for the comment

209
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:07,870
you're absolutely right it would have

210
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:09,460
been nice had they done that and again

211
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,779
you're asking specifically about these

212
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,540
forms and that was a good idea so

213
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:15,759
everyone had the same templates at least

214
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:17,259
the same structure for these forms they

215
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,509
took your comment to heart and I think

216
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:20,919
probably many others and they did

217
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:22,539
something about it now the problem is

218
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,659
transitioning for the people who did not

219
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:27,219
submit those forms moving forward why

220
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,839
are they going to happen we don't know

221
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,310
exactly how they're going to integrate

222
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,490
those two things but hopefully they'll

223
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:35,439
create some sort of wave you just wait

224
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,120
you have to wait until they get back to

225
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,190
you and know and they'll help you I want

226
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,529
to get onto some other things but I I

227
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,820
for you specifically I would wait and

228
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:45,339
see how they bounce it back to you

229
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,780
because they have different depending on

230
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,840
the stage that you submitted they're

231
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:54,699
gonna have a different request for what

232
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:57,399
you submit moving forward so it depends

233
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,720
when you submitted if you submitted your

234
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,059
annual if you haven't submitted your

235
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,810
annual my recommendation is as part of

236
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:07,509
your annual you use the forms right but

237
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:09,459
if you submitted previously at least the

238
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:12,279
stages that I've seen are people who

239
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:15,070
submitted before September they were

240
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,480
asked specific questions and if they

241
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,980
were in the forms or not in the forms

242
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,779
they just asked them to address them and

243
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,659
the procedures they had four people who

244
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:25,720
submitted after September the BCC asked

245
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:28,629
to you can still use procedures but to

246
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,430
use those forms as a framework for what

247
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:32,320
you submit moving forward I think

248
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:34,209
anybody who hasn't submitted they're

249
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,620
annuals yet I highly recommend you use

250
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,460
those forms it's gonna make it a lot

251
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,049
easier for you going forward okay

252
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,180
removal of waste management procedures

253
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:45,969
this was kind of surprising and

254
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:48,849
interesting and there's a discrepancy

255
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:51,730
between the different agencies so the

256
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,220
BCC took out all the specific

257
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:58,090
regulations related to waste management

258
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:01,509
procedures they left in the requirement

259
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:03,340
that the waste is all unrecognized

260
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:05,230
recognizable but they took out the

261
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,410
specific section related to waste

262
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,200
management procedures and in the FSO are

263
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:13,990
the claims were that they were redundant

264
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,710
with the non cannabis regulations and

265
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,659
the cannabis waste requirements so

266
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:22,060
that's where the BCC stands we've

267
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:24,519
submitted numerous annual applications

268
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:26,169
and they all included waste management

269
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,840
procedures it looks like going forward

270
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:31,509
the BCC is not asking for that now I

271
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:35,590
don't know why the BCC thinks that the

272
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:38,200
current the regulations outside of

273
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:41,050
cannabis and deal with it but the CDFA

274
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,400
and the CDP age don't agree but it seems

275
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:44,079
that there is a discrepancy between

276
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,659
those regulations so those of you

277
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,940
applying to CDF a and C D pH you guys

278
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:50,949
still need to have some sort of waste

279
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,870
management procedures those applying to

280
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,879
the BCC I would definitely I think it's

281
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,950
absolutely best practice that have those

282
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,480
procedures in place but they do not need

283
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:04,390
to be submitted with your annual

284
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:06,580
applications now the interesting stuff

285
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:11,500
with new owner and financial interest

286
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:13,300
regulations we from the very beginning

287
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,690
have been telling all of our clients

288
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:19,359
that there's gonna be very few if any

289
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,700
ways to get around disclosing your

290
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,639
owners if you have owners setting up

291
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,840
multiple layers of corporations is not

292
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:32,199
going to hide the individuals who are

293
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:36,160
running those entities and now the BCC

294
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,570
and to certain extent the other agencies

295
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:41,919
have made that clear in their

296
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:43,780
regulations all of those entities need

297
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,240
to be disclosed and they need to be

298
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:49,059
disclosed until they get to warm bodies

299
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,460
so if you think you're going to submit

300
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:53,349
multiple layers of entities and they're

301
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,210
not going to ask who the individuals are

302
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,810
who owned those entities you are

303
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,210
mistaken

304
00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:01,269
and we've already seen this even prior

305
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:04,389
to these new regulations the BCC was

306
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:06,279
asking who the owners were who owned

307
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,899
those entities and if you went to

308
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,370
another entity they said what about that

309
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:11,319
entity and when you go to another entity

310
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,570
they ask about that entity there is

311
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,010
going to be very little way to get

312
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,900
around that so my

313
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:20,980
recommendation to anybody who does not

314
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:23,230
want to be disclosed you are not going

315
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,550
to be able to make that work I don't see

316
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,820
any way that you're gonna get around

317
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:29,769
that so people are going to have to come

318
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,420
to grips with the fact that those

319
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:35,909
individuals are going to need to be

320
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:35,909
disclosed now sorry go ahead

321
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:50,370
so what you're referring to is LA

322
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:56,470
Regulations not the state regulations

323
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:59,740
they do not you can you can they at

324
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,210
previous efforts to try and limit and I

325
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,610
even specifically retail by previous

326
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:07,330
efforts to try and limit how much an

327
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:09,850
individual owner can own did not go

328
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,160
anywhere what did and my the one

329
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:15,040
exception I don't wanna go too off-track

330
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,679
is people who are cultivating with the

331
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:20,740
CDFA you are only allowed to own one

332
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:23,379
medium cultivation site you cannot have

333
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:27,600
more than one medium cultivation site so

334
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:27,600
keep that in mind yes

335
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:35,259
so that's a different question which I'm

336
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:37,539
about to get to financial interest

337
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:39,970
holders so what's now changed with the

338
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:42,519
financial interest holders is anybody

339
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:45,129
who had any profit sharing whether it be

340
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,659
employee or there are a lot of people

341
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:49,480
who tried to come up with different ways

342
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:52,149
to hide their financial interest holders

343
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,980
whether it be someone who who had some

344
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,769
sort of profit sharing relationship a

345
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,509
landowner who didn't want to own the

346
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,519
license specifically but wanted to get

347
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:02,739
some sort of profits from it those

348
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,899
relationships are no longer hiding the

349
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:07,389
financial interest holders anybody who

350
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:09,909
has a profit sharing relationship with

351
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:12,428
the entity that has the license has to

352
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:14,230
be disclosed now that's not the same as

353
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:16,418
an owner disclosure an owner disclosure

354
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,188
you have to do an owner submit oh and

355
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:20,350
they do a background check if your

356
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:22,899
ownership share is less than 20 percent

357
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:26,739
and you're not an officer director or

358
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:29,379
someone who's managing the day-to-day

359
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:31,329
operations then you are simply a

360
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:33,459
financial interest holder which means

361
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:36,038
that you need to disclose who that

362
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:37,568
person is you do not net that you do not

363
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:39,759
need to go through that background check

364
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:41,259
but you will need to be disclosed you

365
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,199
will need to provide your driver's

366
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:46,389
license number and some specific some

367
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,578
other specific information anybody who

368
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:51,159
had takes on new financial interested

369
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:53,138
holders has a required notification to

370
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:54,879
the agency that gave you your license

371
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:57,999
and you will need to make that

372
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:00,938
notification and send it over to the BCC

373
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:02,859
I believe it's now 10 calendar days if

374
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:04,838
someone can correct me I got confused

375
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:06,250
one was 14 days the other was 10

376
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:11,708
calendar days I think they switched it

377
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:14,669
to 10 calendar days yes so if they're

378
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:14,669
getting any profits

379
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,720
so that's an in so the interesting

380
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,490
comment was that anybody who has

381
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,730
employees who have some sort of profit

382
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,289
sharing relationship if you have twenty

383
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,789
five thirty employees and they all have

384
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:33,200
a profit sharing relationship you're

385
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:35,178
gonna have to disclose all of them and

386
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,150
this is gonna be a process I don't know

387
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:40,610
how that you know comes out in specific

388
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,730
details but according to these new

389
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:45,949
regulations everyone needs to notify the

390
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,808
BCC about anybody who has this profit

391
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,029
sharing relationship my recommendation

392
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:51,710
to anyone in here who was not aware of

393
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:54,440
that I would definitely have it on your

394
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,329
radar and either now or as soon as those

395
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,700
regulations are officially implemented

396
00:17:56,329 --> 00:18:01,279
make sure you make that notification to

397
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,919
your specific agencies and those

398
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,529
financial interest holder requirements

399
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,660
changed in all three agencies so any

400
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:12,740
anybody who has a state license is gonna

401
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:18,380
have to make that disclosure license

402
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:20,509
fees so the CDFA and the CD pH my review

403
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,750
those did not change very much there

404
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:26,058
were some additions in how you calculate

405
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,380
your annual revenue and I don't think

406
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:30,259
there were changes as much as

407
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,360
clarifications and having it in writing

408
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:36,440
exactly how that calculation is supposed

409
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:38,058
to be made with the BCC I I there were

410
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,340
I'm sure there are many people in this

411
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:42,829
room who were aware that the BCC license

412
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:46,699
fees did not make very much sense there

413
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:50,058
were very large intervals and very large

414
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:52,730
fees but for example if they had they

415
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:54,649
used to be I think two point five to

416
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:59,360
seven point five million dollars in

417
00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:00,620
annual revenue for retail shop and the

418
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,729
license fee would jump

419
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:06,649
I think forty or fifty thousand out some

420
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:09,380
outrageously large amount so is to the

421
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,970
benefit of the license holder to shut

422
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,500
down their shop for a couple of days to

423
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,120
make sure they don't hit that revenue

424
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,000
amount because it was such a large fee

425
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:19,129
disparity the state the BCC fixed that

426
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,980
and now they're smaller intervals I

427
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:24,230
think that the in general all of the

428
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,789
license fees went down slightly I think

429
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,679
they realized that they were unrealistic

430
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,029
it's part of the trial and error system

431
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,159
but for those of you who are very

432
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:32,178
worried about that I think because of

433
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,549
the

434
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:35,960
narrowing of those intervals you're

435
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,819
going to be benefit it's gonna make a

436
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,380
little bit more sense I don't think

437
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:40,639
anybody likes paying the license fees so

438
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,990
I'm not going to say it makes complete

439
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,809
sense but it makes a little bit more

440
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,120
sense than it did previously and all

441
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:49,009
just for the record the section there

442
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,839
has all of if you look in the red line

443
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:53,029
you can compare them and see them I

444
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,909
didn't want to go through each separate

445
00:19:53,029 --> 00:20:04,308
license category but they're all in the

446
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:05,929
regulations yes yes if you pass the most

447
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:08,029
threat I think the most threshold

448
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:10,309
I don't recall exactly what the amount

449
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:13,038
is now but and it depends on I guess the

450
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:16,279
license category you're in but it's all

451
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:21,650
you know 7.5 and higher you're gonna hit

452
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:23,298
that amount in the license fee so I can

453
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,220
tell you based on the applications they

454
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:27,079
always have the highest threshold and

455
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,140
higher and that's what you're putting in

456
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:33,769
the license application all right

457
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:35,120
I would definitely it for whatever

458
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:37,038
reason that's not clear in the

459
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,959
regulations I would assume the highest

460
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,669
category they can't make up the amount

461
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,169
you're paying so it's gonna be it's

462
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:47,259
gonna be that highest license fee

463
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:49,159
expiration of temporary licenses again I

464
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:51,200
think I don't think this is new to

465
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:53,510
everyone this was initially in the this

466
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,130
was one of the big items in the June

467
00:20:53,509 --> 00:21:01,579
release but the temporary licenses no

468
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:06,710
new licenses or temporary licenses can

469
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:08,869
be issued after December 31st 2018 now

470
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,450
those of you who have not submitted your

471
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:14,959
application for your temporary license

472
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,909
it might be too late for the CDFA is a

473
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,220
little bit slower I think it could be

474
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:21,820
very unlikely for some of you who are

475
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:24,350
still applying to the BCC or the CD pH

476
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:26,178
you might be able to get in but it's got

477
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,599
to get in today in order for them to

478
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:31,429
issue it before the end of the year so

479
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,109
everyone has to make sure that they are

480
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:36,500
doing that again that applies to all

481
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:39,769
three agencies now the reason that this

482
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:42,679
is interesting is there's interplay

483
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:45,619
between the temporary licenses and the

484
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,800
provisional licenses in order for you to

485
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:52,519
get a provisional license this new

486
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:56,659
statutory creation from I guess it was

487
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:58,789
in the summer this provisional license

488
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,610
where you are going to pay your license

489
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:05,000
fees and you go on track and trace and

490
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:07,369
then you will have a year license it's

491
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,808
it's I guess it's provisional license

492
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,279
because it's only a year but it's more

493
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:13,039
than your temporary license and it's not

494
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:14,660
a regular annual license in order for

495
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,329
you to qualify for those you need to

496
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:19,759
have a temporary license you need to

497
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:21,619
have submitted your annual license and

498
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,490
you need to have gone through the full

499
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:30,229
sequa project and report and submit that

500
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:33,740
now the area which is a little bit

501
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:35,539
uncertain is that is whether or not your

502
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,329
annual license needs to be in before the

503
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:41,329
end of the year now I've never gotten

504
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:42,799
any indication from anyone that that was

505
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:44,240
the case all that needs to happen before

506
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,609
the end of the years you need to have

507
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,259
your temporary issued moving forward I

508
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:50,509
would pay close attention to that but I

509
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:52,429
was on a call with the c-d-c DFA this

510
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:54,379
morning and that was the one agency I

511
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:56,300
was a little uncertain of the BCC and

512
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,760
the CD pH I think already made it pretty

513
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,950
clear that you can submit your annual in

514
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:02,240
the beginning of next year the CDFA

515
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,640
there was a rumor that went around

516
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,079
saying that maybe you needed to submit

517
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,090
your annual before the end of the year

518
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,460
according to the person I spoke to from

519
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:12,799
the CDFA that is not the case you can

520
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,569
submit it next year your annual and

521
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,129
still qualify for the provisional

522
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:18,500
licensing now that was with the phone

523
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,890
call so don't take that to the bank just

524
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,359
yet

525
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,090
I'm waiting for it to see it in written

526
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,619
form but pay close attention to that and

527
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:26,269
for those of you who haven't submit your

528
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:27,678
annual make sure you're ready to submit

529
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:28,940
that at the beginning of next year so

530
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:35,300
that way you can move on to your

531
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:37,250
provisional licensing okie dokie the new

532
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:40,279
OSHA requirement

533
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,740
all three agencies have the exact same

534
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:46,009
text and is written right in the slide

535
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,960
if you have more than one employee you

536
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:51,170
need to make an attestation in your

537
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,720
annual application that one supervisor

538
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,840
and one employee who have successfully

539
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,480
completed a Cal OSHA 30 our general

540
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:01,189
industry outreach course offered

541
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,470
by a training provider that is

542
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,299
authorized by an OSHA training institute

543
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:09,049
Education Center to provide the course

544
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:10,669
so planning in advance that regulation

545
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:12,589
is a clear change you have to make that

546
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,120
attestation that if you haven't done it

547
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:18,789
yet you will be doing it in the future

548
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,789
so please put that into your planning

549
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:24,320
CDFA the new premises diagram

550
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:26,389
requirement now this is gonna be a very

551
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,579
specific detail but I want to throw it

552
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,040
out there you need to have an area for

553
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:33,409
segregating cannabis or non manufactured

554
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,049
cannabis products that are subject to

555
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,029
administrative hold for whatever reason

556
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:39,649
you have issues with the state agency

557
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:41,480
and they put any of your products on

558
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,790
administrative hold you need to have a

559
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,440
separate area not necessarily a separate

560
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:49,809
room by a separate area to put those

561
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:53,210
products this is specifically for the

562
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:54,769
CDFA I there is no comparable provision

563
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,350
that I've seen in the other agencies but

564
00:24:54,769 --> 00:25:00,369
specifically in the CDFA regulations you

565
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:05,089
need to make sure that you have that

566
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:06,829
lastly new pesticide requirement this is

567
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:09,109
not new but they put it into the

568
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:11,240
regulations so that it's clear you need

569
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:13,490
to have an attestation that says you're

570
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,950
going to contact your County

571
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,380
agricultural commissioner and make sure

572
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,720
that the pesticides you are using are

573
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,610
legal for those of you who have not done

574
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,740
that I would reach out usually the

575
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:27,740
county agencies at least LA County has

576
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,690
been very nice they have people who are

577
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,759
in the field working on this you can

578
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,680
reach out to the county and they've been

579
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,869
very helpful to us in talking to them I

580
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,700
would reach out and for cultivators make

581
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:41,569
sure that you are only using legal

582
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:44,360
pesticides lastly and not in the slides

583
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:47,329
for those of you who are concerned about

584
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:49,789
illegal grows I want to remind everyone

585
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:53,089
that the collective sunset is expiring

586
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:55,490
or the collective sunset is sunsetting

587
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:58,429
so those of you who are concerned about

588
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,920
people who are in that gray area where

589
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:03,440
they were operating as a collective as

590
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:06,590
they have been for the last ten years or

591
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,509
whatever it may be they those those

592
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:11,000
collectives are no longer going to be

593
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:13,279
able to legally operate which means that

594
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,009
the toolbox for both state

595
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,349
state enforcement agencies and often

596
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:20,779
local enforcement agencies got much

597
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:22,669
bigger so illegal group whoever is

598
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:25,190
operating illegally is gonna have a much

599
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:27,680
tougher time going forward that does not

600
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,049
I I I'm not certain the exact day it was

601
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,380
based on notification of the initial

602
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:35,569
regulations or the the notification of

603
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:39,530
the first license that was issued that's

604
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:43,869
when the one-year expiration began and

605
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:47,869
I'm not I'm pretty certain January 9th

606
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:49,699
all right so this is not coming directly

607
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:53,409
from me from hearing from the crowd is

608
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:56,539
January 9th the collective sunset so

609
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,730
hopefully the state enforcement agencies

610
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:59,960
will take that under consideration as

611
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,420
they move forward and hopefully that

612
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,670
provides them with more tools to shut

613
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:13,490
down the legal shops and grows and

614
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:14,960
whoever else yeah so the the collector

615
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:17,690
exactly under collected under the

616
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:22,190
collective program and 215 when the when

617
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:24,529
mal curso was drafted and passed they

618
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,230
had specifically in there that one year

619
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:28,910
from the the notification

620
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,190
one year from the notification of the

621
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,890
first license being issued that there

622
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:36,320
would be the collective you can no

623
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,509
longer operate as a collective and you

624
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,720
would not fit under the collective me me

625
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:43,460
all right and with that unless there are

626
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,860
any specific questions I don't want to

627
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,809
take too much more time I'm gonna pass

628
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:48,929
down to Julie

629
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:53,219
[Music]

630
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,219
