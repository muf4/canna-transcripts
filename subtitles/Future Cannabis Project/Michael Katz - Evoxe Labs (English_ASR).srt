1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,210
so we've created a line of

2
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:11,519
self-contained vaporizers that blend

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,710
organically-grown essential oils with

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,599
cannabis oil for the first time to

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,240
create a more holistic and complementary

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,310
medicating experience and we've done

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,839
this by selecting organically grown

8
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,689
essential oils that enhance the natural

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:28,890
properties of each cannabis variety so

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,109
for example sativa which is a energetic

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,450
and uplifting experience we have blended

12
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,120
with peppermint lime cypress and

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,520
cinnamon essential oils all uplifting

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,218
and energizing for indica which is a

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,440
more physically relaxing sensation we've

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,808
enhanced the relaxation properties by

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:49,619
blending lavender chamomile orange

18
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:51,659
essential oils we have a hybrid pen

19
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,669
that's blended with just a little bit of

20
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,609
coconut essential oil and a

21
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,980
non-psychoactive CBD pen that's blended

22
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,469
with frankincense ylang ylang tangerine

23
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,509
and geranium and what these essential

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,060
oils do is all kind of prepare the body

25
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,890
and activate it in a way to make the

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,710
experience of medicating with each of

27
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,489
these cannabis varieties more impactful

28
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,489
for the medicator

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,618
you
