2
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:16,079
thanks everyone for being here and

3
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,879
meadowlands for giving us this

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,209
opportunity to talk about regenerative

5
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:23,579
cannabis we have not sitting in order

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,699
Jessie who created the regenerative

7
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:30,629
cannabis farm award with Dan Marr over

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,750
here as well as Jacob and Carla from

9
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:35,579
flower days farm in Trinity County

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,829
forest and Patricia from Sun roots farm

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,609
in Mendocino County and Josh from moon

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,770
gazer farm in Mendocino County so these

13
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,450
all of these amazing farmers can tell

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,940
you guys all about regenerative farming

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,829
but before we start that I just want to

16
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,468
let everyone know that the reason I'm

17
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,570
here is because I spent years trying to

18
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,850
find the dankest weed that I could smoke

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,250
and that search led me to these farmers

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,859
and their weed really is the dankest and

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,929
when I found out that they grow in a way

22
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,640
that is actually good for the soil and

23
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,069
their watersheds and the bees and the

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,840
whole ecosystem I was amazed and

25
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,219
inspired and it's basically the only

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,228
thing giving me hope for the future

27
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:14,849
right now but even if I didn't care

28
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:16,829
about the environment or my carbon

29
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:18,298
footprint or the survival of humanity I

30
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,000
would still want to smoke their weed

31
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,850
because the flavors and the effects are

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,769
of a spectacular quality and from my

33
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:28,349
point of view as a pot snob who cares a

34
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:30,840
lot about quality I believe that the key

35
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:33,449
to that spectacular dankness is in the

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:39,359
relationships between the farmer and the

37
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:41,159
plant and the soil so I think so Jesse

38
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,739
should tell us about the regenerative

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:49,079
cannabis farm award on how it recognizes

40
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:51,688
those connections well traditionally in

41
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,399
like cannabis cups we're celebrating the

42
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:56,789
flowers we're really excited about

43
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,159
what's the dankest and and I'd and I

44
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,770
agree I think that the dankest practices

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,450
lead to the dankest flowers that it is

46
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,670
it's a relationship with the soil with

47
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,219
the land with community the art that you

48
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,030
put into the flower biodiversity healthy

49
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,500
environment that that comes forth that

50
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,979
makes the flower art it makes it

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,229
something that

52
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:19,949
you want to ingest but like how do we

53
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:22,109
talk about that and so with the Emerald

54
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:23,639
cup and the cultivation classic we

55
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,260
created this award called the

56
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,229
regenerative cannabis farm award that

57
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:30,209
recognizes these practices and we

58
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:33,149
created an application process where we

59
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,090
can have farms tell us about them hear

60
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,189
their story we have a lot of different

61
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,340
specific things that we ask about so we

62
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:44,430
can know about watershed we can know

63
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,610
about soil practices closed-loop systems

64
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,239
community work and then we get to set up

65
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,769
site visits and go and meet them and

66
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,819
recently this last year's we've been

67
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:59,730
doing documentaries with with Claire of

68
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:01,500
la Oso films who's filming right now and

69
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:04,348
man they've been coming out so beautiful

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,639
they connect the audience with the

71
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:07,738
practices because you can see the

72
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,108
animals you can see the soil you can see

73
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,759
the connection with the land and it's

74
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:13,409
like that's the cannabis I want to smoke

75
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,620
that's growing from this beautiful soil

76
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:18,780
in Pali culture so it's been this

77
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,519
amazing journey of the last few years

78
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,379
and one of the coolest parts is you get

79
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,439
to meet really amazing friends along the

80
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:27,120
way and you get to learn a lot and then

81
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,829
you get to feature the best farms and

82
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,419
then now this conversation is out there

83
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,359
about the practices how is cannabis

84
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,739
grown how can we do it better for our

85
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,040
environment how can we do it better for

86
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,129
our watersheds and our communities and

87
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,689
and also grow the best cannabis and

88
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:45,030
reduce our costs at the same time and

89
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:48,079
come together as a community of sharing

90
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,750
information so we have some amazing

91
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:56,040
farmers here that have that represent

92
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,628
the last two years three years oh yeah

93
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:02,578
that's true yeah sorry three years yeah

too so the very first year all three

96
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:08,939
years are represented so that's amazing

97
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,159
um the very first year we had dragonfly

98
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:14,489
Earth Medicine GreenSource gardens and

99
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:19,048
moon gazer farms and it's it's been

100
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:20,608
amazing to see how how you know putting

101
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:22,199
having them come up on state you know

102
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:23,788
take that award having people connect

103
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,468
with that and seeing the journey of

104
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:27,539
that's come from there and the

105
00:04:25,468 --> 00:04:29,449

have been doing amazing work

107
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,170
consistently building their land every

108
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,870
year there's improvement there's more

109
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,340
closed-loop systems there's and with so

110
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,689
much food and polyculture and now

111

you've taken on connecting with the

117
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,980
community being at events like this to

118
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:01,979
continue talking about these practices

119
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,650
and you know it's like we all have these

120
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,870
abilities to do these things we can

121
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:09,349
build soil we can build polyculture and

122
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,149
we can grow better cannabis as we do it

123
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,890
and the more we talk about it the more

124
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:15,120
we empower each other the more we show

125
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:16,919
each other practices there's not like

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,750
one way to do something the best it's

127
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,509
each different environment and each

128
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,579
different you find what works for you

129
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:26,519
and it's it's a it's a collaborative

130
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,509
effort but yeah let's let's hear a

131
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,399
little bit about what's going on your

132
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:36,539
farm thank you

133
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:38,039
I'm Josh from moon gazer farms yeah I

134
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,530
mean it's been a it's been a wild

135
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:45,390
journey since 2016 I mean we we had just

136
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,009
actually landed at this property so we

137
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:50,789
had just started building our Google

138
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:54,240
culture beds then and just seeing how

139
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:58,460
much life is coming through in these

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,259
beds and and and all the worms and and

141
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:03,209
activity I mean we have just you know

142
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,769
the worms are now just kind of going

143
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,299
even into like the forest and they're

144
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:08,399
helping to even just break down like

145
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,699
things in the woods like even faster and

146
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:17,310
stuff - I mean you've create a sanctuary

147
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:20,550
on your land that is you know is is a

148
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:23,189
haven for for up for life you know and

149
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,290
and bees and and we're able to do that

150
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:27,060
as small cannabis farmers and if we are

151
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:31,110
able to do it then why shouldn't we do

152
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,790
it it's kind of how I feel and and you

153
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,480
know if I and as and as a cannabis

154
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,480
consumer myself

155
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:44,819
I prefer why wouldn't I prefer to have

156
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:49,168
well I prefer to have something that's

157
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:52,110
grown in the soil in this full Sun of

158
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:54,029
course sangra Sun grown in general is

159
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,730
better than even an even endure of

160
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:58,529
course but for me personally I would

161
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,540
like to see it in the full Sun this is

162
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:01,918
where we talk about full spectrum if

163
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,950
we're talking about the highest quality

164
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:07,139
product I want it to be planted in the

165
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:10,680
spring and I want to be harvested in

166
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,329
this in the in the fall and we have and

167
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,990
it's and it's going through the entire

168
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:17,789
cycles of nature you know and when we're

169
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,240
talking about like the moon cycles and

170
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,250
the cosmic cycles this is this is part

171
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,129
of just a natural rhythm right now it's

172
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:30,779
spring everything's green outside and

173
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,939
yeah so that's kind of how we're how

174
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,709
we're approaching approaching it and

175
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,959
we're just blessed that we're able to

176
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:39,029
grow from seed we don't have the

177
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,529
pressure of having to do a lot of Konoe

178
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:42,659
I understand people have to grow from

179
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:45,869
clones that come from who knows where

180
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,640
and you need to have a consistent

181
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,949
product for the market I get that but

182
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,250
you know we've been able to figure it

183
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:54,899
out to be able to grow from seed you

184
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,288
know continue to breed on our land

185
00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:00,659
continue to create strong genetics that

186
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:02,339
are meant for our land and of course

187
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,930
bring in you have to bring in genetics

188
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,788
too sometimes from people so it's nice

189
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,900
to have this regenerative network of

190
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:09,538
people because you don't you don't wanna

191
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,589
I don't like to imbrie too much to so

192
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,699
that's what's beautiful about this

193
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:13,379
connection that we have with other

194
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,810
farmers and stuff too that we're able to

195
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:17,519
I got some velvet goo actually growing

196
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,060
right now from sun roots that I'm pretty

197
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:23,069
stoked about and and and some cherry

198
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,610
lime dog from Jessie that's going real

199
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:31,158
strong I gotta get some of that rose

200
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:34,500
lemonade from you guys too but yeah yeah

201
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:36,870
but yeah so that's kind of where I stand

202
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,729
and it's so beautiful to have this just

203
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,759
the support of the regenerative movement

204
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,229
so that we can really grow in the intim

205
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,379
in my opinion like the most ideal

206
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:48,060
fashion possible

207
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,620
we still don't make a hundred percent

208
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:51,500
all of our own potting soil but we're

209
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,600
working towards that

210
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:57,000
maybe you guys could talk about it well

211
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,580
I just want to mention that I've spent a

212
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,490
lot of time in moon geezers few goals

213
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,670
and its really you can if you've if

214
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,560
you've been to a pot farm you really

215
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:09,029
have not experienced anything like what

216
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,099
it feels like to walk around moon

217
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:12,689
geysers garden even from you guys have

218
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,980
been building up your soil over the

219
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,720
years and it just keeps getting better

220
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,129
and better but even from the first year

221
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,950
even when you were still building them

222
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:23,129
there already was just bursting with

223
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:25,560
this like vibrant energetic life force

224
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,389
that like just feels so different than

225
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:30,149
than what you would normally think of as

226
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:31,799
a farm and watching it grow is really

227
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:33,990
awesome and watching it just like keep

228
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,969
exponentially amplifying and building on

229
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,070
itself and watching the goat herd keep

230
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,259
getting bigger is really a delight and

231
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,060
these and Josh's Josh and his wife

232
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,309
Sandra who's not here have been super

233
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,259
awesome about inviting people to come

234
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:47,789
and see what they're doing and like feel

235
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,769
that feeling and then take that home

236
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:51,089
with them to their farm and I think it's

237
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,860
been really beautiful what you've been

238
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,379
doing to build community and like

239
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,919
holding up that example for everyone so

240
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:01,799
thanks for that and I was hoping that

241
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:04,049
some that actually no flower days that

242
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,120
flower days would talk to us about their

243
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:07,740
farm and specifically what I think is

244
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,289
really having also gotten to visit your

245
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,789
farm what really stands out is how you

246
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:14,370
guys are very dedicated to keeping

247
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:17,279
things small because you're very focused

248
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,560
on these little details that might get

249
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,939
lost otherwise and it like the way that

250
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,779
you're approaching it from this boutique

251
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,460
standpoint I was hoping you could tell

252
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:30,179
us about that and how that translates

253
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:33,090
for you well part of our effort to stay

254
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:37,439
small is also the limitations of the

255
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:42,870
land we work with so a goal on our farm

256
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:46,650
is to try and explore what what we can

257
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:49,740
how we can cycle nutrients through the

258
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:52,500
land and so we are keeping animals and

259
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:56,340
the land is also feeding them it's also

260
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,440
growing food to feed us and so through

261
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:03,030
that we're able to generate enough

262
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,320
fertility for what we're working on and

263
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:09,089
that's a really

264
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:12,870
special thing it's basically since in

265
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:16,440
1925 farm farmers were recognizing that

266
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:19,590
soil and nutritional quality of food and

267
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,180
medicine were deteriorating and so this

268
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:24,120
has been a problem for a long time and

269
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:26,689
so since 1925 it's degraded even further

270
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:32,450
and so what work we need to do is

271
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:36,180
recreate natural cycles of animals

272
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,910
consuming you know like the coarse

273
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:41,969
fibers that grow on the land not

274
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:45,839
imported foods and recirculating that

275
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:50,580
through our farms so that we can rebuild

276
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:52,350
this high nutritional quality and really

277
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,730
that nutritional quality is what's going

278
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,740
to give you the quality that you're

279
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,409
going to enjoy and take and taste and

280
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,879
your food in your in your cannabis and

281
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:04,319
so I mean that's something for all

282
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:07,230
agriculture to start striving for we

283
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,810
don't really have time to start doing

284
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,629
anything else and keep getting this

285
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:16,049
fertilizer from Indonesia and this thing

286
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:18,240
from there and these cow bones are from

287
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:22,949
industrial slaughter offices but we call

288
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,590
it organic like that that's not progress

289
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,600
you know and so we're talking about

290
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,060
climate change and we have these goals

291
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,730
that we're trying to meet and so what is

292
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:34,979
what is the answer to that and like so

293
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,139
for me I took that really personally

294
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:43,649
like I was living in the city and I felt

295
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:49,110
like dude my life is this is not you

296
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:51,079
know like this is not a solution that

297
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,639
I'm being a part of you know

298
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,370
participating in this huge consumptive

299
00:12:53,639 --> 00:13:01,080
society and so how do we figure out how

300
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:04,529
to to fix that and and so we went on a

301
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,180
quest for that and we've discovered that

302
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:08,069
the cannabis we were producing was

303
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:10,469
really high quality and so it's our goal

304
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:13,110
to produce cannabis that goes out and

305
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:16,029
inspires people to keep to maybe make a

306
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:18,340
change in their life and

307
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,589
so that's kind of where we're coming

308
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,740
from with staying really small-batch on

309
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,680
our land and we hope that as we build

310
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:32,500
our fertility you know the batches will

311
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:35,620
grow but we are we put ourselves in a

312
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:47,950
box so that we could try to think

313
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:50,769
outside of the box yeah I mean I think

314
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:52,660
in a lot of ways we just really made a

315
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:54,699
lot of changes in our lives because of

316
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:58,809
our initially because of our personal

317
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:02,170
health and cannabis is very integral to

318
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:05,409
our own healing and our both physical

319
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:08,439
and metaphysical and spiritual healing I

320
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:11,289
would say and in our kind of quest to

321
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,200
discover what living a sustainable life

322
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:18,069
really means in today's world and how

323
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:22,240
how we could actually be part of the

324
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:25,390
solution we through cannabis the plant

325
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,190
led us to to Trinity County and to this

326
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:29,230
homesteading community in hi and palm

327
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,880
which is kind of outside of Hayfork

328
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,490
so you get to Hayfork and then you still

329
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,529
have to go like 45 more minutes down a

330
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,200
windy road and it's on the South Fork of

331
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,449
the Trinity River and it's this just

332
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,360
epic little valley and there's a lot of

333
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:46,600
beautiful epic little looks out here and

334
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,060
it's the mountains are steep around us

335
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,040
and it's like canvas just loves to grow

336
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:53,229
there we have a long outdoor growing

337
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,349
season and we can grow all our stuff

338
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,750
like josh is talking about doing it

339
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,970
through the whole full season in the

340
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,980
cycle of nature and once you start

341
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,320
really integrating yourself into nature

342
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,750
you start seeing like like Kate ins

343
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,020
Caitlin's talking about how lovely it is

344
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,389
to see the goat herd and life exploding

345
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:15,639
everywhere and it's springtime and you

346
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:17,110
really witnessed that right now and when

347
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,620
you start to see that you realize that

348
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,750
ok well we know that it makes our food

349
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,659
better we know it makes my canvas better

350
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:32,059
we see in the science

351
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:34,860
everything nutritionally all of the

352
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:36,599
terpenes the whole profile everything

353
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,629
we're looking at doesn't matter if

354
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,360
you're talking about food or or cannabis

355
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:45,480
you you see everything testing higher

356
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,060
better just more nuance coming out in

357
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,839
the flavor especially but in the

358
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:53,609
nutrition in the quality and so for us

359
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,320
being small batch or a three acre

360
00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:00,209
property and we initially bought a place

361
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,240
that needed some work but from a

362
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:06,569
permaculture perspective as far as a

363
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:12,539
property that you could really work on

364
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:14,940
the soil work on the design of the land

365
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:17,278
as a whole and figure out how to turn

366
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,740
the farm into a real integrated living

367
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,078
organism and if you can let the

368
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,070
biological systems really thrive and

369
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:29,669
build the systems that provide sanctuary

370
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:32,910
then suddenly you see that life is

371
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:35,669
exploding and that you don't have to

372
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:38,578
deal with the problems because they're

373
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:41,819
being dealt with already like you don't

374
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:45,000
have to spray for a pest or you don't

375
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:48,450
see a pest infestation because you have

376
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,179
an actually complete ecosystem that is

377
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:54,570
dealing with itself you have health and

378
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:59,059
you have health in a in another way

379
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:03,870
because you have this joy and you see

380
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:06,029
you start to see life really working in

381
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,039
a progressive way where it's actually

382
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:11,009
getting better things are getting better

383
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:13,709
and it happens quickly remediation

384
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:15,959
happens quickly regeneration happens

385
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:17,939
really quickly cells rebuild themselves

386
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,578
really quickly in the human body the

387
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:23,429
human gut becomes healthy really quickly

388
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:26,220
but you have to do the things to make

389
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:28,830
the right environment and then you see

390
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,440
the results in the quality and for us

391
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:33,299
it's about the art and it's about the

392
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,429
plant and that's never going to change

393
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:37,168
and so we can only put so much energy in

394
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,610
and on three acres you can do what you

395
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:40,259
can do on three acres but we're not

396
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:42,779
planting three acres of can

397
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:46,920
we live on that three acres our animals

398
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:50,269
live from that three acres and we grow

399
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:53,539
all our food on that three acres we grow

400
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:56,970
all our animals food on that three acres

401
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:59,009
we're getting there you know we we have

402
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,839
things we source sometimes locally and

403
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:03,150
that's the other really integral part of

404
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,759
it is that it's a larger ecosystem that

405
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:08,640
you're a part of you're one part you're

406
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:11,720
a living biological system your farm is

407
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,130
and then it's part of another localized

408
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,620
ecosystem and we need to work in our

409
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:21,150
localized communities for resources

410
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:23,489
because they're abundant and if we use

411
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:26,430
our surpluses that we have on a small

412
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:29,009
scale to supply each other like hey Fork

413
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:32,820
you know needs to grow a lot more hay

414
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:36,119
because we need a lot more local organic

415
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:37,829
straw mulch it's actually frustrating to

416
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,750
try and source things sometimes which is

417
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:42,960
why we went to the point of realizing

418
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:45,690
like we need to be self-reliant enough

419
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,920
to not have to import anything and so

420
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,230
that's what we're striving for

421
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,360
ultimately and what that does for the

422
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,420
quality too is it builds your terroir it

423
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,459
actually makes your specific

424
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,220
characteristics of your soil in your

425
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,079
land and the place where you live come

426
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,839
out and there's a story behind each

427
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:05,609
place and you know we really understand

428
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,429
that to a pretty sophisticated level in

429
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:12,809
wine but as far as cannabis we still

430
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:15,690
have a lot of education and people need

431
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:18,599
to actually experience it to know it and

432
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:21,690
understand it and that's part of what

433
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:23,459
terroir means it's you know the place

434
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:28,340
and the characteristics of that place

435
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:31,319
that give the product that's being

436
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:34,649
cultivated there whether it be wine or

437
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:36,539
cheese or cannabis I mean there's

438
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,720
Appalachians that were just talking

439
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:43,799
earlier about Appalachians for chamomile

440
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,630
and there's an amazing terpene and

441
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,460
chamomile which we found in some of our

442
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:51,000
strains were really prevalent and it's

443
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:53,669
it's part of what makes it calming it's

444
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,098
part of why it makes the highest

445
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:57,839
amazing I mean there's so much nuance to

446
00:19:56,098 --> 00:20:01,048
it that's the art behind it and that's

447
00:19:57,838 --> 00:20:02,729
why it's so fun to be a farmer and what

448
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:05,009
we really need more of actually is

449
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:07,379
scientists to come out to the farm and

450
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:11,128
help us continue to collect collect data

451
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:13,828
because it's a lot to manage and that's

452
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:18,208
something we could really you know use

453
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:19,819
some collaboration with people doing

454
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:22,798
that kind of work

455
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:24,328
suggestions I just got a weather station

456
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,398
and they're not that expensive and it

457
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:28,019
constantly just updates data but it's

458
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:31,858
just a great tool to be able to put

459
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:36,179
right near gardening your cultivation

460
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:38,458
location and get the radiation the

461
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:41,309
temperature the humidity you can get

462
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:43,528
them with soil probes to get temperature

463
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:45,298
you could set up game cams and like

464
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:47,940
really like pay attention to everything

465
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:49,408
and the rhythms of the plants with the

466
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,609
environment but it's cool just to have

467
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:56,820
it you can look on your phone at any

468
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:59,848
time and see yeah that's awesome so

469
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:02,398
there's those close loops the looking at

470
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:05,878
the farm as a whole we had a really good

471
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:08,578
example this trip up to Oregon and our

472
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:11,368
winners this year Lane Creek Kemp they

473
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:14,128
do full Google cultures they have

474
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:16,488
animals on-site lots of different like

475
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:20,248
llamas and sheeps and goats and pigs

476
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:23,308
they grow about 27 acres I think of a

477
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:25,379
straw that's feed for the animals and so

478
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:27,178
they've actually fully closed that loop

479
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:29,788
and it's kind of interesting just like

480
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:32,339
looking at this land and seeing the way

481
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:35,338
water moves and energy moves and the way

482
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:37,708
they've done like small things that are

483
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:41,368
gonna like lead to really big thriving

484
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:42,899
changes and just with how energy flow is

485
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:44,939
how water flows and putting the things

486
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:47,418
in the right place for a system to build

487
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,979
itself and then building diverse

488
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:51,869
polyculture both in the soil diversity

489
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:53,519
and in the plants that you're growing

490
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:56,488
and when you're doing that you're

491
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,469
bringing up all this all this ability to

492
00:21:56,489 --> 00:22:01,399
process nutrition when you have a

493
00:21:58,469 --> 00:22:04,379
diverse biology in the soil it's able to

494
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:05,818
you eat whatever is there and make it

495
00:22:04,378 --> 00:22:07,138
available for the plants and then all

496
00:22:05,818 --> 00:22:07,388
these different plants are able to bring

497
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:08,798
all

498
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:11,348
these different minerals and nutrition

499
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:13,028
up and they bring it to the surface and

500
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:14,439
then that's mulching back in and it's

501
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:16,628
just constantly building soil when

502
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,338
you're part of that process you're part

503
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:20,138
of sequestering carbon to create

504
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:22,898
something that that leads to nutrition

505
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:24,069
and it's a system that just thrives and

506
00:22:22,898 --> 00:22:25,658
thrives and thrives and you're able to

507
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:28,058
make an economic product at the same

508
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:31,149
time something that has value that let

509
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:33,519
you know that people get jobs based off

510
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:35,018
of that feed family and you're literally

511
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,519
improving the environment like how

512
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:38,739
amazing is that there's very little

513
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:41,679
thing few things in the world like a

514
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:44,259
business that actually don't have you

515
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,329
know dramatic negative effects on the

516
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:48,878
environment and regenerative agriculture

517
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:51,128
is one of those things that that do and

518
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:54,398
most of Agriculture is horribly

519
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:56,378
destructive and so the more we support

520
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:58,238
small farmers that build soil that build

521
00:22:56,378 --> 00:23:01,028
polyculture that reach out to community

522
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:04,058
that provide really good products that's

523
00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:06,459
what we need to do as a society so

524
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:07,898
support these farmers up here thank you

525
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:10,659
for coming to things like this and

526
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:13,689
believing in this I was just gonna say

527
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:15,759
real quick in the regenerative cannabis

528
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,669
calendar I just saw for this month the

529
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,378
the stropharia opposed there were there

530
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:22,209
was a lot of info about it that I hadn't

531
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:24,908
known about how it benefits the bees

532
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:26,709
even so with those Kings for for your

533
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:29,049
mushroom you're benefiting the bees

534
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:33,249
you're growing food you're sequestering

535
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:35,618
carbon and that's that's a really that's

536
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:37,899
a fine tenet of regenerative canvas so

537
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:47,708
he's referring to - mushrooms wood

538
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:50,998
eating mushrooms like yeah oh yeah once

539
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:53,169
Jessi starts talking about closing loop

540
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:56,440
well I think everything that we're

541
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:58,059
saying about systems and all these

542
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,338
things integrating really speaks to what

543
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:02,648
for me is the real differentiator

544
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:06,458
between these farmers and most farmers

545
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:08,348
is this attitude of like instead of like

546
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:10,749
you're the master farmer and you're

547
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:12,638
looking down at your farm and everything

548
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,348
is like your responsibility and if

549
00:24:12,638 --> 00:24:16,328
there's a pest problem you have to solve

550
00:24:14,348 --> 00:24:18,668
it it's seeing there's this incredibly

551
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:20,259
powerful larger force and it's like

552
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:20,679
working within that and creating that

553
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:23,349
environment

554
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:25,659
and that's necessary to let these forces

555
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:28,990
do what they need to do is just a much

556
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:30,730
more powerful and an effective approach

557
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,798
I think and that's what really makes all

558
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,599
of the any whether it's cannabis or

559
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:35,769
produce stand out when it comes out of

560
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,808
these kinds of Gardens

561
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:40,149
so I think some roots should tell us

562
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:42,668
about how they do that to make

563
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:44,949
especially really beautiful enormous

564
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:46,960
crazy colored cool-looking plants in

565
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,669
particular but also just really

566
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,749
nutritious and good for the soil and all

567
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:54,788
that stuff - thank you you guys are all

568
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:57,009
amazing and everyone here for being here

569
00:24:54,788 --> 00:25:00,278
thank you so much for taking the time to

570
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:02,460
care it matters it matters to care

571
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:06,970
everything that we do makes a difference

572
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:10,720
I'm Patricia and speaking on kind of

573
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:12,460
what you were saying Caitlin about not

574
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,379
looking down on your farm as if it's

575
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,069
you're the master gardener because

576
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:21,158
there's no hierarchy in the garden there

577
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:22,210
is something I always want to speak on

578
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:26,470
when we talk about regenerative

579
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:30,159
agriculture is that yeah letting go of

580
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:33,490
control in the garden and letting go of

581
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,759
control in a way that helps you to open

582
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:40,240
your your eyes and your perspective to

583
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:42,970
what you may not see when you have all

584
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:48,128
these ideas and all these structures in

585
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:51,129
front of you and when you let go in the

586
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:54,269
garden you're listening more and that's

587
00:25:51,128 --> 00:25:57,308
my biggest thing on regeneration is that

588
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:59,288
we're here not as controllers but as

589
00:25:57,308 --> 00:26:01,450
servants to this earth really I see

590
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:03,460
myself is this like okay mom on earth

591
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,798
like I will do this I will continue

592
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,440
working hard and and for my community

593
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:11,589
and for everything that I stand for it's

594
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:14,019
not easy work it's intensive labor

595
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:16,749
intensive you know mentally physically

596
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:19,450
spiritually you're in it all the time

597
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:21,519
and it's a commitment and you know we're

598
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,929
human so we're it's wonderful to make

599
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,109
mistakes because we learn and grow from

600
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:31,210
them but yeah regeneration in the garden

601
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:33,969
again and just in our lives where we're

602
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,329
all need to do our part and then power

603
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,519
you

604
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:39,490
hether and support these kind of small

605
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:43,329
farms and support the lifestyle of of

606
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:45,308
helping one another out because not only

607
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:46,750
are we regenerating our land and working

608
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:49,329
our soils and building and building

609
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:52,089
every part of the year we're building up

610
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:56,460
soil because the work is not really ever

611
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:59,019
done so you continue doing things and as

612
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,440
you build up in that you build up in

613
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:06,880
other parts of yourself where you can be

614
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,649
better for the world and be better for

615
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,929
the environment because right now we

616
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:13,719
need all these earth stewards to come

617
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:16,298
forward like you're all-powerful each

618
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,519
one of us has so much power to really

619
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:20,138
make a difference in this world and yeah

620
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:23,349
we're all these little small farmers in

621
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:25,719
these mountain areas way out there but

622
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:27,699
wherever you are you make a difference

623
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,250
so with your little Gardens you know

624
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,649
plant what you can and even if it's in a

625
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,369
container and a patio in the city that's

626
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:37,509
fine

627
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:39,849
do do our part and I'll let forests talk

628
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:43,528
about big plants because this man is

629
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:47,168
like I always praise them up but just

630
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:49,750
yeah I walked into his farm five years

631
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:52,000
ago and it's changed a lot since then we

632
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:54,028
have a lot more flowers and the

633
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,619
everything is building and building

634
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:58,778
we're basically building compost piles

635
00:27:56,619 --> 00:28:02,199
for every single plot of land we have

636
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:04,528
ten by tens where we just keep adding

637
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,319
the manure adding the straw adding

638
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:13,419
mushroom mycelium woodchips adding

639
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:16,388
plants chop and drop that is definitely

640
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:18,788
a big creation of the larger plants and

641
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:21,908
also the genetics that that we're

642
00:28:18,788 --> 00:28:23,648
working with our local and I'll let for

643
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:30,278
us get into it more but thank you all

644
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:33,189
for listening thank you and so diversity

645
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:35,798
is one of our main things that we try to

646
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:41,340
focus on having as many types of plants

647
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:44,528
and as we can around the the ganja and

648
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:46,359
giving space and the vision to seeing

649
00:28:44,528 --> 00:28:47,769
how you know if you're gonna grow a big

650
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:49,839
plant you need to like

651
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:54,039
invision at the end you know giving it

652
00:28:49,839 --> 00:29:00,129
enough space so it has that potential to

653
00:28:54,039 --> 00:29:02,440
get to where you want it to go and just

654
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:07,470
keep building the soil up layer by layer

655
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,470
and having those natural you know

656
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:13,029
systems to help you on the way

657
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:15,250
so maybe get some context for when you

658
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:18,480
say big plants what that means in case

659
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:21,579
people haven't seen your plants

660
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:29,529
last year the look the largest one was

661
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:31,659
like 20 pounds they 60 yeah 16 feet 20

662
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:33,519
pounds dried yeah

663
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,400
no way I call bullshit but I saw these

664
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:39,970
players painted like they're beautiful

665
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:43,360
that one was grown on like a compost

666
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:46,059
pile of old we'd like stems and stalks

667
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:52,029
but like I mean the majority of them

668
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:53,559
were 10 plus you know these these are

669
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:57,779
all strains that I've been breeding

670
00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:00,009
myself you know on the farm for years so

671
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:03,759
no not 20 feet high

672
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:08,140
not quite that big how wide probably

673
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:12,250
like 12 feet wide by you know 13 14 feet

674
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:14,680
tall you know if you go to regenerative

675
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,319
cannabis farming org there's videos that

676
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,140
you can link to that walk you walk

677
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:22,629
through these monster pants it's it's

678
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:27,430
all it's all about how many bud sets the

679
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:29,320
the density of the the colas and how

680
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:32,230
happy they are you know if you're giving

681
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:35,319
them the right nutrients and an adequate

682
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,299
amount of water you know we we have drip

683
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:39,700
systems that go you know once around the

684
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:41,980
base and then around you know the big

685
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:46,090
part of you know the mass amount of the

686
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:49,210
soil that we have and so like they pull

687
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:51,459
out water when they need it and you know

688
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,750
have as much nutrients as they need also

689
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:58,390
so available so you know throughout

690
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,819
their course of growing

691
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,250
oh all I have to do is go out there with

692
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:06,099
a hose and like do a hand water to like

693
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:08,470
feed them extra food you know I don't

694
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:10,119
have to add anything else everything

695
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:13,180
else everything that they need is in the

696
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:15,239
soil already so we walk us through the

697
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:19,539
soil building and composting process

698
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:23,890
well that's like a yearly process like

699
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:26,920
in the fall we we prep the beds by

700
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:31,240
laying more more straw and covering any

701
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:35,110
bare spots and then in this in this and

702
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,309
then we throw out cover crops too so you

703
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:39,339
know during the winter there's cover

704
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:41,289
crops that are growing and then in the

705
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:47,519
springtime you know we cut the cover

706
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:50,470
crops and add bring in more more manure

707
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:54,509
locally-sourced and our own you know we

708
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:57,549
have alpacas so they're really good

709
00:31:54,509 --> 00:32:04,210
adding nutrients they have a high

710
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:04,829
phosphorous it's phosphorous we're in

711
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,269
public

712
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:09,099
California Mendocino so two hours inland

713
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:10,379
from here but I just wanna say about the

714
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:12,819
apakah

715
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,280
because they have communal dung piles

716
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:18,220
and they are really hygienic and they

717
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,779
are light on the earth they don't eat as

718
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:23,589
much they don't drink as much and

719
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:26,910
they're less harmful in ways that

720
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:30,069
livestock can be so that's one of our

721
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:32,529
you we don't milk them just some we the

722
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:35,259
little koreas the baby alpacas we let

723
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:37,899
them have all the milk and I think you

724
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:39,879
can though the camel lid milk is

725
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:46,090
apparently very delicious but we haven't

726
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:49,810
tried it so in the springtime then we

727
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:52,659
bring we pretty much make a pile of

728
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:56,200
manure right in each plot where we're

729
00:32:52,660 --> 00:33:01,360
gonna put one plant so each plant gets a

730
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:03,269
pile of manure and then what was I gonna

731
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,959
say

732
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:09,789
no-till so if anything we have these

733
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,650
meadow Forks metal creatures they're

734
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:13,599
great broad Forks

735
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:17,320
so if you want to loosen up your soil

736
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:19,959
you have a you have those to do a little

737
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:23,289
bit of mixing if you need to other than

738
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,450
that you know that's pretty much it just

739
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:27,460
pruning the plant up when when like

740
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,200
three or four times during the grow

741
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,660
cycle

742
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,120
caging them really well because right

743
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,670
where we have we have lots of strong

744
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:40,509
wind and they'll blow your plants right

745
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:42,610
down if you don't have them fence post

746
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:45,879
in you know we have tea posts on each

747
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:48,219
corner and then a cage going up you know

748
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,890
two feet high off the ground so we can

749
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:53,170
actually you know support the plant well

750
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,840
and then we'll have to like do a third

751
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,539
cage at the end right before that you

752
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,859
know they're they're done you know in

753
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:04,269
august-september we're third caging it

754
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:07,299
so it's a big process but you're totally

755
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:09,878
worth oh yeah we start our seeds in

756
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:12,519
February second week in February second

757
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:15,250
third week in February so you know

758
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:18,579
having that whole process of you know

759
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:20,860
from springtime all the way till fall so

760
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:23,829
these plants are sucking in all this

761
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:28,480
energy from the the cosmos and the

762
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:30,668
ground all that nutrients and you know

763
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,378
just making a real medicine for the

764
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,969
people you know and that's what it's

765
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:36,909
about you know we're all we're all

766
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,829
growing medicine so and that's the most

767
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:43,648
important thing keeping the cannabis

768
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:47,710
sacred so that's how we feel thank you

769
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:50,159
thanks so much I was hoping that we

770
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,480
could maybe get a little bit more into

771
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,829
kind of explaining what's going on in

772
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,860
the soil that you guys are creating

773
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:58,389
because for me as I was like visiting

774
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,250
farms like these guys and really

775
00:34:58,389 --> 00:35:02,259
starting to understand what makes them

776
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,719
so special that was like a big light

777
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,940
bulb moment for me was like oh living

778
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:10,149
soil that's really what it comes to it's

779
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:13,000
like no-till living soil going to a farm

780
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:15,160
and having having Jesse say look at look

781
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,110
at this look at my soil look at these

782
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:19,599
worms look at these spiders and he's

783
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:22,510
like oh my god my worms

784
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,980
so I think you know we could talk about

785
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,540
like how you build your soil and that's

786
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,969
really valuable information for people

787
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:30,880
that are gonna do it but just for anyone

788
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:34,299
that's gonna consume cannabis or buy

789
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,420
cannabis or sell it like what is live

790
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:40,720
like what makes living soil different

791
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,670
than you know what a bagged soil with

792
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,009
maybe you know you can put nutrients in

793
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,800
it but what makes that no-till living

794
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:51,490
soil special and different than then

795
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:57,130
other than dirt it's connected to

796
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:58,809
everything and it has like as far as

797
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,910
like building it like there's no like

798
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:02,440
this is a way to build soil or make some

799
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,699
super soil it's like working with your

800
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,860
environment what makes sense you know

801
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:07,659
like certainly cover cropping and

802
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,640
mulching working with animals and

803
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:12,869
building biodynamic compost and

804
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:17,769
integrating that back in Google cultures

805
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:20,889
burying wood creating dynamic spaces

806
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:22,360
with organic matter that's like tons of

807
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:24,429
different types of foods for very

808
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,099
diverse microbes and continuingly

809
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:29,500
building on that diversity and adding

810
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:31,779
more organic matter and as you do that

811
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,159
you just draw more and more life and you

812
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:38,470
know it's not just about like we talked

813
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:41,710
about the the bacteria and the fungi but

814
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:44,619
I when you're seeing a lot of the larger

815
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:47,820
bugs you know the centipedes and little

816
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:51,789
soil mites and all kinds of fun things

817
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:53,350
worms and like there's all this nutrient

818
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:54,759
cycling that's happening you're like you

819
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:56,679
just think about how much energy is

820
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,480
happening to constantly have these more

821
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:59,859
and more critters that are like moving

822
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,539
around eating and pooping and and

823
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,250
they're just building more and more soil

824
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:07,059
and they're all just doing their own

825
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:09,190
thing you'd like feeding themselves but

826
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:10,840
they're all improving everything you

827
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,659
know as they do their thing you know

828
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,250
they all have their specialized way and

829
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:16,989
you know I kind of see that as part of

830
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,940
this regenerative movement is like

831
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:20,769
paying attention to like you know all

832
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,210
those bugs are building soil and they're

833
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:23,769
doing their own thing you know like how

834
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:26,230
we can all kind of connect like that and

835
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:28,000
and put carbon in the ground and build

836
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,159
living soil and grow good things out of

837
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,769
that you know the same with with

838
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,339
mutualistic relationships of any kind

839
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:36,550
with plan

840
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:38,320
with with soil biology you know cannabis

841
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,630
roots there cannabis is a mutualistic

842
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,450
organism that's how it like evolve zits

843
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:46,300
very smart so it knows how to give other

844
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:49,089
organisms what it wants and so the main

845
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,870
process that's happening on the the

846
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:55,480
roots is is this exudate exchange where

847
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:57,190
the roots of the plant are they have all

848
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,230
of this energy from the Sun that they

849
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:01,210
can turn into carbohydrates and they can

850
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,949
feed different bacteria in the soil they

851
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,690
can feed different fungi those fungi

852
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:06,909
have the enzymes that can then break

853
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:09,940
down other minerals in the soil the

854
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:13,000
plant can uptake that and it becomes

855
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:15,700
this cycle where the soil biology

856
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,679
thrives the plant thrives all the energy

857
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:18,879
is coming from the Sun the carbon gets

858
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,500
stored in the ground and it's a system

859
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,170
that continually builds and builds and

860
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,030
builds and what's left behind is soil so

861
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,829
like yeah those are the processes to

862
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:30,280
mimic and that's what plants have

863
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:32,679
evolved to have their best health with

864
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,000
just like us eating a healthy diet like

865
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:38,169
eating a fibrous market you can eat

866
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:42,099
around food a plant growing from insect

867
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:44,170
poop and fungi and in and well developed

868
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:46,779
in aerated because like worms are moving

869
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,849
through and because the fungi clumps

870
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,220
things together we have aggregated soil

871
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:53,170
that allows the right amount of air that

872
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:55,209
allows the right amount of organisms to

873
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:57,070
have an environment to all thrive and it

874
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,110
just continues and continues and that's

875
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:02,530
going to give birth or give rise to the

876
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:04,120
best you know how off the best in the

877
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,820
plant and then the best cannabis and

878
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:09,639
terpene production at the end so that's

879
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,230
why if you buy soil and then throw it

880
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:13,000
away at the end of the season that is

881
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:15,760
incorrect and should not be your

882
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,170
approach you're the soil you know it

883
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,810
just just be this thing that you're like

884
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,849
constantly like improving and adding to

885
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:23,529
and and it's like it's the most valuable

886
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:25,809
thing you have you know and if we all

887
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,970
like think about that like that's where

888
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:29,500
everything of value comes from that we

889
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:31,629
grow all of our nutrition that's what

890
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,119
keeps us healthy like and if every

891
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:36,250
person you know like their space like

892
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:37,809
thinks about that soil and say a sacred

893
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,159
and something like they can make thrive

894
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,929
more and more every year

895
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:43,829
you're sequestering carbon and you're

896
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:43,829
bringing health to the world

897
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:53,119
what is it oh so easy ya know all kinds

898
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:56,239
of things you know compaction bare soil

899
00:39:53,119 --> 00:40:00,559
the Sun beating down having water go

900
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:03,979
over correctly spraying anything doing

901
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,539
any kind of salt nutrients pH going off

902
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,260
there's all kinds of things that you

903
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:10,579
know you make it like a change and the

904
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,890
biology is very specific especially

905
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:14,480
different bacterias for a very specific

906
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:16,489
environment so the pH gets thrown off

907
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,110
salt balance gets there you have a total

908
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:20,419
die out of a certain thing and then that

909
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:22,329
throws a whole cycle off so like you

910
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,500
have to be really careful of not

911
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:27,230
allowing any kind of collapse in your

912
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:29,300
soil biology that using things like that

913
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:31,909
you know keeping it protected don't over

914
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,620
compact don't leave things bare don't

915
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:40,699
every you know don't use salt nutrients

916
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:44,929
don't use pesticides thank you for

917
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:46,639
explaining that to us so when I started

918
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:48,319
smoking cannabis that came out of this

919
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,109
kind of soil and realized how different

920
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,970
it was then the cannabis that I might

921
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,950
have previously been smoking it pretty

922
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:56,480
quickly made me realize that I only

923
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:58,189
wanted to eat food that was coming out

924
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,059
of living soil also because the

925
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:03,110
difference is so dramatic and then that

926
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,670
kind of means you have to start growing

927
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:06,950
your own food and building your own soil

928
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,260
if you want that but I think a big part

929
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:11,509
of all of your Gardens is like that is

930
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,460
the same soil is providing your food

931
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,530
that you eat like you're not gonna spray

932
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,849
pesticide on your cannabis cuz you are

933
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,650
dedicated to what you're doing and you

934
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,150
know that's wrong but also like that's

935
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,430
your food that you're eating is coming

936
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,960
from right right there so I was hoping

937
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:25,399
maybe anyone who wants to speak to it

938
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,050
all you could talk about just what it's

939
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,119
like to have that kind of connection

940
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,700
like it's not just like this is my job

941
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,409
this is my cash crop it's like this is

942
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:35,269
my life this is my food this is

943
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:37,129
everything and that's I think a really

944
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:39,889
magical relationship that not very many

945
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:42,710
people nowadays have gotten to see your

946
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:45,319
experience and it really like it really

947
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:48,079
colors like your whole existence I think

948
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,670
when you are doing that and eating

949
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,090
eating the food that's coming out of

950
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:54,860
those kuegel beds or those those beds so

951
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:57,039
does anyone talk about their food that

952
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,039
they grow

953
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:07,889
I'll start because I think the change we

954
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:10,739
made in our lives basically saved my

955
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:12,748
life from a health perspective I think I

956
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:18,150
don't know where I would be if I hadn't

957
00:42:12,748 --> 00:42:22,469
started seeking the answers to like what

958
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:26,818
am i eating and and insource I mean the

959
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:28,858
city sourcing your food is it took it

960
00:42:26,818 --> 00:42:30,829
would take me all week and I had certain

961
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:34,788
farmers at the farmers market and I knew

962
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:38,789
exactly how they grew their food and

963
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:43,739
they nourished me and kept me alive but

964
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:46,170
I think it's really important that you

965
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:51,358
know ultimately the solutions are

966
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:53,909
solutions to a lot of things and if

967
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:56,699
we're only focused on profits for the

968
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:59,629
sake of profits and we're not taking

969
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:05,038
into account the people or the planet

970
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:09,838
and their health like for real like the

971
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:13,349
quality of the life then what are we

972
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:18,058
really gaining and for how long is that

973
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:21,869
even sustainable and we don't have the

974
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:23,579
time to waste anymore to be playing that

975
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:25,579
game and I'm not interested in playing

976
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:31,259
it I'm not interested in buying anything

977
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:33,269
or consuming anything that does doesn't

978
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:36,179
take these things into account and so

979
00:43:33,268 --> 00:43:39,088
for me it was like a big life choice in

980
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:40,980
a lot of ways that led me to be a canvas

981
00:43:39,088 --> 00:43:42,719
farmer in a remote valley in Northern

982
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,650
California where I'm growing all my own

983
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,480
food but to know what it tastes like to

984
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:50,608
go to a high-end pomme potluck there's

985
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,380
like the saying that like once you've

986
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:54,179
been to a high-end pomme potluck you're

987
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,298
like ruined forever because you could go

988
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:59,068
to like the best restaurant in Paris or

989
00:43:57,298 --> 00:44:02,699
wherever and you're just gonna be like

990
00:43:59,068 --> 00:44:04,380
yeah it's pretty good or you could

991
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:05,969
appreciate the chef or if you go to a

992
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,619
place that's really farm-to-table like

993
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:09,419
for real and you can really appreciate

994
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:14,039
it but there's nothing

995
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:16,530
like homegrown so like one thing is if

996
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:21,389
you can grow it in your backyard I hope

997
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:24,559
you will and the other is that it's Luke

998
00:44:21,389 --> 00:44:28,139
it is lucrative to support sustainable

999
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:30,599
business that's based on health and

1000
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:33,239
well-being of everybody involved and

1001
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,859
that's mutually beneficial and it's

1002
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:37,379
really important that we start thinking

1003
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:38,969
that way because if we don't where are

1004
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,099
we going and how does that how does

1005
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:43,259
anybody really win otherwise and it's

1006
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:44,789
just like we were just like there's no

1007
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,000
more time to waste we're just gonna like

1008
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:50,338
die like well I'm dying I can feel

1009
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,739
myself dying I'm like not even that old

1010
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:54,690
this is fucked up you know so like what

1011
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:57,029
are we gonna do about it and oh look at

1012
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:58,289
these mycelium in the woods they like

1013
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:00,869
found their way indigenous

1014
00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:02,789
microorganisms to this crazy plastic

1015
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:04,740
that some cartel left here and they're

1016
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:07,170
like eating it and turning it into soil

1017
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:09,239
and like if you just build it they will

1018
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:11,548
come so like like seeing the

1019
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:16,078
microbiology on are just three acres and

1020
00:45:11,548 --> 00:45:19,858
what it could do to our ecosystems I

1021
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:22,318
mean we can reverse climate change if we

1022
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:27,058
practice regenerative agriculture it's

1023
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:34,460
very simple I don't even know what the

1024
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:34,460
original question was I'm sorry I think

1025
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:42,838
going back to the no-till growing our

1026
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:45,710
food in this system is is very

1027
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:49,880
unconventional in terms of agriculture

1028
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:53,010
having the this this constant supply of

1029
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:56,519
luscious you know lomi amazing living

1030
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:59,220
soil for for your food I mean we're

1031
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:02,338
going through this right now my you know

1032
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:04,048
my wife just had two babies and there's

1033
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:06,358
a whole there is this you know in terms

1034
00:46:04,048 --> 00:46:07,679
of milk production and lactation all

1035
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:12,000
this kind of stuff I mean there is a

1036
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:14,039
real nutrient like food sort of science

1037
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,659
to all that you know I mean we're

1038
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:19,619
harvesting like stinging nettles out of

1039
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:21,529
our garden and these are all things that

1040
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:24,079
are growing in like a no-till

1041
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:28,040
nutrient-dense

1042
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:31,369
style and and it's real and you can

1043
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:32,779
really feel it and and it goes on I

1044
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:34,940
spoke about worms in the beginning but

1045
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:37,250
it you know there's all kinds of life

1046
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:39,079
there's all different kinds of earthworm

1047
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:42,079
castings are wonderful but then you have

1048
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:44,239
the insect frass from the pill bugs and

1049
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,920
I mean it goes even all the way to

1050
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,259
hummingbird poop I mean there's probably

1051
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,108
some special compound in that and we're

1052
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:54,020
a track and we're attracting them with

1053
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:57,949
with certain flowers that we grow next

1054
00:46:54,019 --> 00:47:00,289
to our plants you know so it's just

1055
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:04,579
creating creating good life is where

1056
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:09,650
it's at I wanted to tap in and just say

1057
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:12,559
to like to be real also with not all of

1058
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:14,210
us have access to being on a farm and up

1059
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:15,440
in the mountains like you live in the

1060
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:18,650
city you live in the city and that's

1061
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,300
perfectly fine and fine I think it's

1062
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:23,088
important to find your strengths and

1063
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,950
where you are you know like our strength

1064
00:47:23,088 --> 00:47:27,858
is growing food but that's not

1065
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:30,439
everybody's lifestyle so you go out and

1066
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:33,049
you support the people who support you

1067
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,780
back and in turn you know where you guys

1068
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:39,230
have a mutually benefiting relationship

1069
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:41,450
and also diversifying with different

1070
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:42,920
foods and medicine I think it's so

1071
00:47:41,449 --> 00:47:44,719
important to talk about not many people

1072
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,088
talk about this in cannabis I feel like

1073
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:49,848
you know herbal medicine there's all

1074
00:47:47,088 --> 00:47:51,769
these other herbs and sacred flowers and

1075
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:54,050
food is medicine and everything that's

1076
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:57,170
growing is basically medicinal all

1077
00:47:54,050 --> 00:48:00,710
around us and when we can combine the

1078
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:03,200
intake of cannabis with different herbs

1079
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:05,000
that were either growing or sourcing

1080
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:07,608
from someone that we know who's growing

1081
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,250
them I grow them if anyone is ever

1082
00:48:07,608 --> 00:48:13,608
interested in herbs because I I believe

1083
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:16,099
that we have to blend up the different

1084
00:48:13,608 --> 00:48:19,309
medicinal values of each plant so you're

1085
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:21,710
not only receiving anti-inflammatory and

1086
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:23,389
adaptogenic properties from one plant

1087
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:25,760
but you're receiving it from multiple

1088
00:48:23,389 --> 00:48:28,309
different sources so that your medicine

1089
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,410
is actually now enhanced and more

1090
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:32,559
diversified and it's all about that it

1091
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:35,029
always comes down to that how we can

1092
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,449
diversify everything around us our

1093
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:39,869
culture's our come

1094
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:41,608
Unity's and ourselves internally it's

1095
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:44,160
it's I think it's an important balance

1096
00:48:41,608 --> 00:48:46,619
to have thank you so much for bringing

1097
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:48,149
up the importance of diversity and I

1098
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:50,250
think that really comes through across

1099
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,838
like the soil the companion planting

1100
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:54,659
growing around food all of it it's

1101
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:57,029
really like diversity is a huge part of

1102
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:59,399
every regenerative farm I think and when

1103
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:01,109
I see like a big monoculture now it

1104
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,780
makes me just really sad and it looks

1105
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:05,338
dead to me because it's like the

1106
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,190
diversity of all the different plants

1107
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:09,750
and one hukill bed or in one space and

1108
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:11,490
then the diversity of all the different

1109
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:13,619
types of life that are going on in the

1110
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:17,039
soil I think all of that comes together

1111
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:18,750
in this amazing symphony and I thought

1112
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:20,940
it would be nice to hear you mentioned

1113
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,829
that um Patricia you mentioned that you

1114
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,480
didn't always have so much things

1115
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:26,339
besides cannabis growing in the cannabis

1116
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,929
garden and now you guys have more

1117
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:29,699
flowers and more all different kinds of

1118
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:32,578
things and I was wondering if you have

1119
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:34,529
noticed changes you know changes in the

1120
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:37,070
space changes in the cannabis after

1121
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:39,839
increasing more different types of life

1122
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:42,390
absolutely one of the parcels that were

1123
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:46,170
honest actually was planted 20 years

1124
00:49:42,389 --> 00:49:48,389
prior with by a woman who created a

1125
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:50,210
Wildlife Sanctuary so we had one half of

1126
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:52,559
the property that's like amazing

1127
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:54,000
thriving plum trees fruit trees

1128
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:57,929
everything that nature and all these

1129
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,849
birds and bats want and then on our side

1130
00:49:57,929 --> 00:50:02,219
of the property when we move there

1131
00:49:59,849 --> 00:50:05,849
it was a long progress because most of

1132
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:09,029
it was just cattle ranching you know our

1133
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:11,430
areas AG land so a lot of ranchers

1134
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:13,560
around there and it's all flat all the

1135
00:50:11,429 --> 00:50:18,868
trees have been kind of in the valley

1136
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:21,719
what was it used to be a swamp more

1137
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:24,710
grassland and then it all got fenced off

1138
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:27,269
so what we had to do was sheet mulch and

1139
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:29,338
sheet mulching is beautiful because you

1140
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:31,259
can start with like a graph a piece of

1141
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:33,480
like land of gravel where nothing's

1142
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:36,839
growing at all and you just start adding

1143
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:40,170
the layers of soil and two years later

1144
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:41,460
or even months late months later I mean

1145
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,750
three months later you can see the

1146
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,490
difference in the soil you can put your

1147
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:47,519
hand in and it's soft and it's it's

1148
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:49,889
workable but years later and I'm talking

1149
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,369
about now I mean the amount of flowers

1150
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:56,309
and

1151
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:58,500
and thriving native plants and trees the

1152
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:59,969
birds are crazy like people who stay

1153
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,469
over our house they're like oh my god

1154
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:03,569
why are these birds so happy in the

1155
00:51:01,469 --> 00:51:06,149
morning like 5 a.m. they're going off

1156
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:07,740
and you can't sleep anymore but but

1157
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,579
unless you're used to like me and you

1158
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:11,129
can sleep through it

1159
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:13,670
but yeah it's just you're creating like

1160
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:16,230
a paradise an ecosystem that is

1161
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,700
literally paradise like if you can

1162
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,679
imagine the most beautiful place that

1163
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:22,829
you would want to go to I'm sure it has

1164
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,539
flowers and gardens and edibles and

1165
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:28,500
fruit that you can just pick off trees

1166
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:30,809
that drips on you and it's divine that's

1167
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:34,349
what we're striving for is just making

1168
00:51:30,809 --> 00:51:36,599
this paradise and I we keep spreading it

1169
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:41,089
wider and wider and wider and that's

1170
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:41,089
what we do with each other - hopefully

1171
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:50,279
it's amazing with the herbs and

1172
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:53,730
medicinal plants is just growing them

1173
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:56,190
with cannabis you you improve your past

1174
00:51:53,730 --> 00:52:02,519
situation like big time having yarrow

1175
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:03,659
having basil oregano Lavin all these

1176
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,460
different herbs that are really easy to

1177
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:06,690
grow that just kind of take off on their

1178
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:10,289
own that you want to have in your garden

1179
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:12,590
anyway chamomile and love it's like

1180
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:15,059
they're bringing in all these different

1181
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:18,510
insects that keep the the whole system

1182
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:20,789
in balance and I almost never see out of

1183
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:23,190
control you know out of balance pest

1184
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:28,159
issues in gardens with a huge amount of

1185
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:31,679
polyculture so last year we had a Fadel

1186
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:34,710
they showed up and all of a sudden they

1187
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:38,489
were like all over in certain parts of

1188
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:42,389
the garden and it was Connie unnerving

1189
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:45,539
for a minute and then you know what do

1190
00:52:42,389 --> 00:52:48,779
you do you know no we're not gonna spray

1191
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:52,889
chemicals on them so we did a little

1192
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:56,340
research she found out that spraying

1193
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:59,339
milk on them helps so we started doing

1194
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:02,130
that and then you know the beneficial

1195
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:05,099
bugs these little sipper flies the

1196
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:08,519
Hoover flies they started laying their

1197
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:10,019
larva on on the plants and I was like

1198
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,969
what the heck what are these little

1199
00:53:10,018 --> 00:53:15,179
larvae is on here now I have all sorts

1200
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:17,159
of bugs it's like it's like a haven for

1201
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:19,710
all you know all these types of new bugs

1202
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:20,848
that I add it's like whoa so he's like

1203
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:25,619
why'd you make us plant all these

1204
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:27,479
flowers here ruining it but then then we

1205
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,789
find out that that they're you know

1206
00:53:27,478 --> 00:53:32,518
they're going around eating these aphids

1207
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:33,960
and I'm like taking the aphids and

1208
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:39,929
putting them in front of the little

1209
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:42,630
larva and watching them devour them and

1210
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:44,460
then I see the aphid population

1211
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:46,680
diminishing off for certain plants you

1212
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:49,289
know like Oh some of them almost like

1213
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:52,649
you know a hundred percent and so it's

1214
00:53:49,289 --> 00:53:55,910
pretty amazing to see like this actually

1215
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:57,900
working and you know the garden just

1216
00:53:55,909 --> 00:54:00,778
taking care of itself

1217
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:04,979
you know so having that diversity is

1218
00:54:00,778 --> 00:54:07,768
very crucial and you know just having

1219
00:54:04,978 --> 00:54:09,568
fruit trees around and you know being

1220
00:54:07,768 --> 00:54:12,228
able to pick your fruit with you you

1221
00:54:09,568 --> 00:54:16,199
know as you smell your buds and you know

1222
00:54:12,228 --> 00:54:17,968
it's it's all it's just you having like

1223
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:20,038
a Garden of Eden around you you know

1224
00:54:17,969 --> 00:54:23,940
it's just that's all I think what we all

1225
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:26,489
want so I think that gives a really

1226
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,139
different like seeing that seeing those

1227
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:29,969
systems work and seeing how quickly they

1228
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,650
can work and how the garden can sort of

1229
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:34,139
take care of itself when it has the

1230
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:36,599
appropriate amount of diversity it seems

1231
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:38,400
to make make you guys all a lot more

1232
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:40,170
calm than a lot of people who are

1233
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,079
managing a garden like I've been in Josh

1234
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:45,119
takes patience developing that patience

1235
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,278
and that calm really it comes in or

1236
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:50,670
anything you do did not panicking but

1237
00:54:47,278 --> 00:54:53,659
also you start to learn you know these

1238
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:56,789
plants and the animals and the insects

1239
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:59,998
they're not just like working for us

1240
00:54:56,789 --> 00:55:01,739
they're beings of their own independent

1241
00:54:59,998 --> 00:55:06,449
nature that deserve our love and respect

1242
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:11,099
and we can't get along well without them

1243
00:55:06,449 --> 00:55:13,689
and so if we keep farming in ways that

1244
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:16,630
hurt these creatures

1245
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:18,579
we're in big trouble yeah let's get

1246
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:21,190
along with the creatures I've been in

1247
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:23,650
I've been in moon gazer scarred a lot of

1248
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:25,630
times and seen because like I said you

1249
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,650
guys always have just different people

1250
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:28,480
coming through and checking out the

1251
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:29,740
garden and so I always see we're always

1252
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,150
walking through the garden and someone's

1253
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:32,919
coming through and they're like Oh Josh

1254
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:34,358
I just found something here there's you

1255
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,280
out of bugs here there's some stuff

1256
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:37,869
growing here and every time he's so

1257
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,579
chill they're like oh look out and these

1258
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:41,079
are you know experienced farmers not

1259
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:43,210
just random people that are like oh my

1260
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:44,410
god a bug like they're experts they know

1261
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,670
what they're talking about they're like

1262
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:47,379
oh oh you got something to worry about

1263
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:49,088
here and every single time you just let

1264
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:51,010
it roll right you're like oh something

1265
00:55:49,088 --> 00:55:53,380
will come along and eat that like just

1266
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:55,119
so chill and your weed is amazing and it

1267
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,369
does not get all eaten by bugs so it

1268
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:00,490
seems like it's working so just not

1269
00:55:57,369 --> 00:56:02,798
stress out about that there's definitely

1270
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:07,479
an element of trusting in nature that

1271
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:12,969
that it'll it'll it'll work out and and

1272
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:15,369
observing well yeah biological

1273
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:19,808
intelligence is amazing and I mean it's

1274
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:21,430
very nuanced and so you have to know

1275
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,990
what you're looking at for sure and

1276
00:56:21,429 --> 00:56:24,759
sometimes you have to constantly be

1277
00:56:22,989 --> 00:56:27,219
doing research and we need to be really

1278
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:29,799
connected in our communities because you

1279
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:32,169
know just an in agriculture like new

1280
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:35,710
things come in as like it's actually the

1281
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:37,889
because of hemp blowing up that we saw

1282
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:41,559
these new aphids for the first time on

1283
00:56:37,889 --> 00:56:44,798
cannabis the their hemp aphids that

1284
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:46,150
crossed over so anyway there's always

1285
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:48,429
going to be something new to deal with

1286
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:53,588
and it's always changing and but but

1287
00:56:48,429 --> 00:56:56,588
biological intelligence is very nuanced

1288
00:56:53,588 --> 00:57:00,179
and it's it's something that you don't

1289
00:56:56,588 --> 00:57:04,389
want to be ever fighting against and

1290
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:07,088
actually if you just really constantly

1291
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:10,480
observe and really work with its own

1292
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:13,058
balance balance it doesn't mean you're

1293
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,619
always perfectly on a straight line in

1294
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:14,980
the middle like this that's not how it

1295
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:18,789
works

1296
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:21,849
balance is fluid and biological

1297
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:22,830
intelligence allows for a natural course

1298
00:57:21,849 --> 00:57:27,269
of

1299
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:29,730
to walk that line in a way that's

1300
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:32,639
actually fluid and that's that's what

1301
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:37,500
life means and that and so when you're

1302
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:39,960
creating as the farmer that creation

1303
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:42,989
that's what life is about its creative

1304
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:46,050
and so ultimately we are the innovators

1305
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:48,899
we are the ones that are that come

1306
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:51,380
before the science the science is that

1307
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:54,389
is what we're doing but then the numbers

1308
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:57,210
just our ways we can measure and

1309
00:57:54,389 --> 00:58:00,239
demonstrate and prove what we are

1310
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:02,400
discovering and so the discovery and the

1311
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,409
creation that's what life is doing and

1312
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,119
the biological intelligence there's more

1313
00:58:04,409 --> 00:58:07,649
more and more and more and more to it

1314
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:09,420
the more to it that you uncover and the

1315
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,980
more that you learn and so that's what's

1316
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,990
exciting about our job but the other

1317
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:16,230
thing is we need to really need to build

1318
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:19,759
space where we can be working in this

1319
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:22,349
way in agriculture and that it is

1320
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:26,070
possible to create both abundance

1321
00:58:22,349 --> 00:58:29,699
well-being health for the planet and the

1322
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:31,680
people and have lucrative sustainable

1323
00:58:29,699 --> 00:58:34,049
system so I think that's really

1324
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:36,359
important that our industry be guiding

1325
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:38,400
this because we've been doing this work

1326
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,230
there's research in Korea there's like

1327
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,750
um hundred years of research from

1328
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:46,199
Germany and other places and we're one

1329
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:48,539
of the places in the United States and

1330
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:50,879
this part of kind of the Western

1331
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:53,460
Hemisphere that you know in cannabis

1332
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,950
that we've been doing this because our

1333
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:58,740
way of life kind of plant all of it

1334
00:58:55,949 --> 00:59:04,969
leads to us asking these questions and

1335
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:08,459
so as an industry how can we really

1336
00:59:04,969 --> 00:59:11,159
support the fact that we are in a lot of

1337
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,210
ways the innovators and and part of the

1338
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:15,170
people that are doing some really

1339
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:18,059
creative work around what can happen

1340
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:20,880
positively in agriculture and with this

1341
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:22,590
plant so I hope we'll all kind of

1342
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,840
continue to really think about

1343
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:28,320
regardless like Patricia said of where

1344
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:31,110
you live how we can support those

1345
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:32,610
systems in our regions because they're

1346
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:35,920
really important to the sustainability

1347
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:39,490
of our of our cities and of our future

1348
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:42,389
in general so say and socially also

1349
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:45,250
promoting diversity as a form of

1350
00:59:42,389 --> 00:59:47,588
resilience when people come out to our

1351
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:49,329
farm and we have you know last year we

1352
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:52,409
had about that we had at one point like

1353
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:56,500
20 visitors at one time came from CDFA

1354
00:59:52,409 --> 00:59:57,759
because they're coming up with their you

1355
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:01,028
know with their ways of looking at

1356
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,940
things and and there was a couple

1357
01:00:01,028 --> 01:00:04,989
farmers there too and one farmer said

1358
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:08,200
they go aren't you are you worried about

1359
01:00:04,989 --> 01:00:11,469
you know pests coming over or you know

1360
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:12,759
and and it's it doesn't really become an

1361
01:00:11,469 --> 01:00:17,469
issue when you have the balanced

1362
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:20,920
ecosystem and and resilient resilient

1363
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:24,038
nature making sort of farm that we can

1364
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:26,200
create want to say I want to smoke the

1365
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:28,119
flowers that come from the farms where

1366
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:31,960
they're paying attention to which plant

1367
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:33,880
had hummingbird poop on it and which you

1368
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,039
know and just noticing the aphids and

1369
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,900
that there'd be you know that the hover

1370
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:39,910
fly started eating I'm like that kind of

1371
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,920
nuance like in connection with your

1372
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:44,288
landscape and your flowers there's no

1373
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,519
way to replicate that it's something

1374
01:00:44,289 --> 01:00:47,410
that's really special it's something

1375
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:51,899
that's art and then something that we

1376
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:51,899
should really do everything to support

1377
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:02,980
agreed well I think there's probably a

1378
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:04,329
lot of things that you guys could share

1379
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,969
that are valuable because you're always

1380
01:01:04,329 --> 01:01:10,089
learning and discovering new things so I

1381
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:13,028
don't if there's anything that that we

1382
01:01:10,088 --> 01:01:15,849
haven't touched on that feels important

1383
01:01:13,028 --> 01:01:19,980
to to share and then we can have

1384
01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:19,980
questions after that anything we missed

1385
01:01:21,769 --> 01:01:25,699
I'd like to encourage everyone to go to

1386
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:28,400
the website regenerative cannabis

1387
01:01:25,699 --> 01:01:30,799
farming org you can learn about these

1388
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,079
farms there's cool photo galleries and

1389
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:38,360
movies and a lot of information about

1390
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:41,019
practices and resource links does

1391
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,019
anybody have any questions

1392
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:47,180
regenerative cannabis farming dot-org

1393
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:49,789
the regenerative farming is is that

1394
01:01:47,179 --> 01:01:52,940
stand alone on its own or who is that

1395
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:56,150
sponsored by where does that stem from

1396
01:01:52,940 --> 01:02:00,440
yeah it's it's a project that I anmar

1397
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:02,750
it's just a way of evaluating farms

1398
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:05,150
based on their ecological and community

1399
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:08,389
standards and something that we just do

1400
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:10,660
independently for both the Emerald cup

1401
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:13,279
and the cultivation classic for

1402
01:02:10,659 --> 01:02:15,170
rewarding farms based on okay cool yeah

1403
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,690
that was my question awesome it's

1404
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:22,030
independent yeah I typed permaculture

1405
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:25,550
and bio vortex it's very grassroots I

1406
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:28,730
just had a question as a like city

1407
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:30,320
dweller I have a small garden and I was

1408
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:33,650
just wondering how it even gets started

1409
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:36,320
and introducing like beneficial bugs to

1410
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:43,670
my crops and where I would get that and

1411
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:45,140
like how to get smaller just build

1412
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:47,510
compost and build a bunch of flood and

1413
01:02:45,139 --> 01:02:49,639
create a bunch of flowers create habitat

1414
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:53,450
for them to come and they'll come so

1415
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:56,059
plant flowers you know move some la

1416
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:58,849
sticks logs around or get some woodchips

1417
01:02:56,059 --> 01:03:01,400
and there's a lot of availability of

1418
01:02:58,849 --> 01:03:04,969
resources in urban areas to do

1419
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,829
interesting permaculture projects look

1420
01:03:04,969 --> 01:03:08,118
up Google culture beds too and do a mini

1421
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:10,369
hula culture you might have fun with

1422
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:13,070
that in the yard it's always fun to to

1423
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:14,900
look at native plants in your area

1424
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:17,030
because that attracts the native

1425
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:20,809
pollinators and bees and bugs that you

1426
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:22,519
like right well yeah if you can do some

1427
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:25,340
research look for a native plant nursery

1428
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:27,739
in your area and there'll be a awesome

1429
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:30,019
resource to let you know how to you know

1430
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:33,608
give a habitat for the bugs that are

1431
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:33,608
best for that particular area

1432
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:41,150
hey um so I work in a nursery and a lot

1433
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:44,150
of the people that I interact with have

1434
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:46,280
indoor grows that try to be very sterile

1435
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:48,079
and use a lot of really unsustainable

1436
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:51,530
practices and I feel like everyone knows

1437
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:53,900
they can't last forever but I'm curious

1438
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:58,030
what you guys think a path toward being

1439
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,030
more sustainable indoors could look like

1440
01:03:58,179 --> 01:04:02,599
hmm

1441
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:04,730
will sustain as far as pest control I

1442
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:06,829
think like a lot of people have pretty

1443
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:10,099
good luck just doing common things like

1444
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:12,019
mineral oils and sulfur and and then and

1445
01:04:10,099 --> 01:04:13,789
then introducing biological controls

1446
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:15,829
like the bugs that might eat the next

1447
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:17,329
one but that's a very control this is

1448
01:04:15,829 --> 01:04:18,980
such a different world the indoor

1449
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:20,150
environment because it's like the

1450
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,469
opposite of what we're doing you know

1451
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:23,000
we're tracting as much life as possible

1452
01:04:21,469 --> 01:04:26,059
and you're trying to kind of control it

1453
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,369
indoors but biological controls do work

1454
01:04:26,059 --> 01:04:29,750
well and and living soil works super

1455
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:30,980
well indoors and you don't have to

1456
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:32,809
replace it and it gets better and better

1457
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:35,059
there's a lot of really good examples of

1458
01:04:32,809 --> 01:04:36,739
people doing like 30 cycles and it just

1459
01:04:35,059 --> 01:04:38,750
improves every time I always pictured

1460
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:40,489
like the most ideal indoor situation

1461
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:42,559
would be like with solar panels and you

1462
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:45,799
had some animals may be grazing outside

1463
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:47,539
and you could use that like material to

1464
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:50,930
compost your beds and stuff like that

1465
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:52,940
and do like a no-till indoor style and

1466
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:54,799
like if you check out check out green

1467
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:57,829
life productions over in Nevada they

1468
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:00,530
have some cool indoor techniques that

1469
01:04:57,829 --> 01:05:02,539
they use there's lots of micro

1470
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:05,930
mycological life and stuff like that in

1471
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:08,840
there and it says there's a way to do

1472
01:05:05,929 --> 01:05:13,009
anything and there are also quite a few

1473
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:16,059
plant based pesticide products on the

1474
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:19,790
market that could be alternatives

1475
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:22,789
there's definitely I know one called

1476
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:25,940
SNS 209 which hat is basically a

1477
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:28,849
rosemary extract it's a pet and it's

1478
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:33,079
like generally recognized as safe food

1479
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:35,539
grade product that is a is a pesticide

1480
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:37,730
you water in made out of rosemary and

1481
01:05:35,539 --> 01:05:42,079
that's it so there are definitely

1482
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:44,960
options for for consumers to support you

1483
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:47,719
know regenerative regrown products if

1484
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:51,079
you choose not to make it yourself

1485
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:54,079
like we do and I think some of that is

1486
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:58,069
definitely worth supporting

1487
01:05:54,079 --> 01:06:00,259
I think it's cool to see in places where

1488
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:02,630
Endor is the only legal option people

1489
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:04,940
exploring companion planting and no-till

1490
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:06,440
living soil in an indoor environment but

1491
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:08,780
I think that the best way to improve an

1492
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:10,070
indoor grow is to take the roof off and

1493
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:12,109
then take the walls off and then take

1494
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:14,900
the floor away we have to remember that

1495
01:06:12,108 --> 01:06:17,900
the reason we grow indoors is not

1496
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:21,530
because it's superior or more clean it's

1497
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:24,590
because helicopters used to fly over and

1498
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:26,780
you could get you could get away with it

1499
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:28,579
you know that's the only reason we grow

1500
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:30,769
indoors why would you ever eat it tomato

1501
01:06:28,579 --> 01:06:33,440
grown indoors are you kidding me like

1502
01:06:30,769 --> 01:06:36,349
who eats tomatoes grown indoors and

1503
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,090
prefers tomatoes like and to grow your

1504
01:06:36,349 --> 01:06:41,210
own medicine in your house not everyone

1505
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:43,369
has a farm and for fighting yourself

1506
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:47,240
medicine it definitely makes sense but

1507
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:50,869
to commercially be be using this much

1508
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:52,819
energy I think I I don't know I heard

1509
01:06:50,869 --> 01:06:54,890
some outrageous statistics about how

1510
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:57,740
much fossil fuels go into an indoor

1511
01:06:54,889 --> 01:07:00,588
pound that's just like the equivalent

1512
01:06:57,739 --> 01:07:03,409
I'm a server of a server center yeah

1513
01:07:00,588 --> 01:07:05,809
it's like it's pretty terrible so we

1514
01:07:03,409 --> 01:07:09,039
need to fix that there's we don't really

1515
01:07:05,809 --> 01:07:12,440
there's no excuses anymore

1516
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:16,400
at least not for us because we have the

1517
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:19,639
environment to do it and we we need we

1518
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:23,088
should be celebrating that and and doing

1519
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:24,920
that because we can now and there aren't

1520
01:07:23,088 --> 01:07:26,358
I mean they're actually that's not true

1521
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,550
they're still helicopters flying over

1522
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:32,779
but that's a longer story and not not

1523
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:36,019
with this panel is about anyway so I had

1524
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:37,880
a friend who grew pretty traditionally

1525
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:39,858
you know whatever worked kind of style

1526
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,390
and you know he was pretty good at it

1527
01:07:39,858 --> 01:07:44,480
and he definitely knows cannabis well

1528
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:46,098
but he was doing a nursery and he's all

1529
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,358
he's been all excited like calling me

1530
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:49,039
the last like several months it's like

1531
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:50,750
constantly like oh my god I'm doing so

1532
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,550
much less work I'm like because he's

1533
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:54,469
gone told the organic and he's just done

1534
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:56,180
natural predators for his nursery and

1535
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:57,529
like there's no spray it's just like I

1536
01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:58,699
don't have to hire anyone up to do

1537
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:01,220
anything the plants are happier than

1538
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:06,799
I've ever seen and you know he's doing

1539
01:08:01,219 --> 01:08:08,358
your amounts of kind of classic you know

1540
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,490
hype strains and stuff like that - and

1541
01:08:08,358 --> 01:08:12,170
keeping them clean just with you know

1542
01:08:10,489 --> 01:08:16,880
organic and biological control simple

1543
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:19,548
it's cool to see that next question yes

1544
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:22,730
so thank you I'm gonna start off by

1545
01:08:19,548 --> 01:08:25,609
saying that I'm vegan and I'm very

1546
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:28,608
regenerative so these questions might

1547
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:31,910
come a little bit more of a reality

1548
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:34,338
check for for me anyway 80% of the

1549
01:08:31,909 --> 01:08:38,180
cannabis that's consumed is grown

1550
01:08:34,338 --> 01:08:41,059
indoors and so the 20% which is where

1551
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:44,710
the beautiful also gets pricing that's

1552
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:46,910
much lower and often much better quality

1553
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:51,289
so I think there's got to be a way to

1554
01:08:46,909 --> 01:08:54,108
bridge that gap and be become more plant

1555
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:57,019
centric for sure

1556
01:08:54,109 --> 01:09:00,039
and you don't need an example of that

1557
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:02,509
with the regards to different kinds of

1558
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:04,219
comparing you know additives that you

1559
01:09:02,509 --> 01:09:05,930
might do whether it's chemicals salts

1560
01:09:04,219 --> 01:09:09,350
whatever because you can look right

1561
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:11,359
around you and see this beautiful that

1562
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:14,750
really doesn't have Monsanto here

1563
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:17,239
doesn't have you know a peak number xxx

1564
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:20,869
it does it on its own it's been doing it

1565
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:24,379
for years right I think the issue is how

1566
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:26,899
do we the Sun is extremely important as

1567
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:30,219
we all know the UV factor so no matter

1568
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:33,559
whether you put it on a greenhouse or

1569
01:09:30,219 --> 01:09:35,838
you do it indoors

1570
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:38,450
the issue is you're not getting UV and

1571
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:40,159
UV is so significantly important for

1572
01:09:38,449 --> 01:09:43,909
pest control as well as compound

1573
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:45,738
development and outside we can get so

1574
01:09:43,909 --> 01:09:47,838
much more compound so much more medicine

1575
01:09:45,738 --> 01:09:49,789
it's all medicine whether you're getting

1576
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:54,069
high on it or not it's medicine so my

1577
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:56,119
question is I see a lot of camaraderie I

1578
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:58,099
certainly do and that's one of the

1579
01:09:56,119 --> 01:10:00,738
reasons I came because I want to be

1580
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:02,690
centered in there it's the kind of souls

1581
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:06,009
that are here but where's the

1582
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:09,589
collaboration in fighting off that 80%

1583
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:11,900
grow and fighting from a quality

1584
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:14,029
perspective from a land race perspective

1585
01:10:11,899 --> 01:10:14,659
being able to buy the true medicines

1586
01:10:14,029 --> 01:10:16,849
that are

1587
01:10:14,659 --> 01:10:19,729
available to us not just in cannabis in

1588
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:23,690
psychedelics and and em but grown in a

1589
01:10:19,729 --> 01:10:27,109
way not only that you are servant

1590
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:29,419
to mother nature but that you produce

1591
01:10:27,109 --> 01:10:32,210
the best highest quality because they

1592
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:34,640
will find you so my question is what

1593
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:37,010
strains or what plants what are the

1594
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:39,800
plans of the group here to differentiate

1595
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:42,350
yourself in the marketplace with a

1596
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:44,930
quality product that no matter what

1597
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:48,650
other people make they know you your

1598
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:52,630
farm for that how how is it that you're

1599
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:55,759
gonna do this against this huge machine

1600
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:57,409
that's going to be branding and they're

1601
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:00,110
gonna do everything else they're gonna

1602
01:10:57,409 --> 01:11:01,819
poison it and I do this often and I'm

1603
01:11:00,109 --> 01:11:05,509
sorry for this I'm getting on a soapbox

1604
01:11:01,819 --> 01:11:08,750
I figure that everything that's not done

1605
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:11,750
the way you do it is poison cannabis

1606
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:14,210
truely's poison cannabis in this way we

1607
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:16,250
extract it with bioaccumulates in our

1608
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:18,829
body along with the chemicals that you

1609
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:21,409
use to grow it which also is in the

1610
01:11:18,829 --> 01:11:25,130
plant so the question is how do we

1611
01:11:21,409 --> 01:11:27,349
collaborate in a way to be able to

1612
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:29,869
change that balance a little bit because

1613
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:32,060
we all know in our heart the cannabis

1614
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:34,809
growing out there in living soil

1615
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:40,190
outdoors is going to produce the best

1616
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:42,230
medicine and high so how would you guys

1617
01:11:40,189 --> 01:11:44,000
go about doing that well that is the

1618
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:45,889
point of the regenerative cannabis farm

1619
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,770
award I got at the heart like that's the

1620
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:51,380
concept it's like the getting this out

1621
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:53,360
there at that thermal cup you have 4,000

1622
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:56,210
people on stage looking up and we are

1623
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:58,250
showing the movies connecting the farms

1624
01:11:56,210 --> 01:12:00,050
with the animals the soil the poly

1625
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:03,079
culture the community work and they see

1626
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:05,570
it and and then you know connecting them

1627
01:12:03,079 --> 01:12:09,470
with the flowers after that - and we had

1628
01:12:05,569 --> 01:12:11,979
a really cool flower testing - and you

1629
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:14,600
did these amazing reviews certified dank

1630
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:17,029
did amazing reviews of all the different

1631
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:18,950
flowers so each different farm put in

1632
01:12:17,029 --> 01:12:21,729
like two different samples and they were

1633
01:12:18,949 --> 01:12:24,649
they were all got these really fun

1634
01:12:21,729 --> 01:12:26,299
elaborate wine type reviews that we're

1635
01:12:24,649 --> 01:12:27,859
actually quite on point because I'm very

1636
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,590
familiar with a lot of problems like wow

1637
01:12:27,859 --> 01:12:31,469
that's really

1638
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:33,630
really good very specific it almost be

1639
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:36,960
funny if you read one of those but the

1640
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:39,029
more that we like kind of have that the

1641
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,829
practices be the subject and the more we

1642
01:12:39,029 --> 01:12:42,989
communicate also with dispensaries there

1643
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:45,029
certain dispensaries like soulful that

1644
01:12:42,989 --> 01:12:47,309
really do push forward these practices

1645
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:49,979
they have the you know come meet the

1646
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:52,230
farmers and so then the consumers get to

1647
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:54,479
connect with you know see pictures talk

1648
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:56,819
to the farmers know the practices and

1649
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:58,259
it's you know it starts off slow you

1650
01:12:56,819 --> 01:13:01,319
know a few years ago it was just like

1651
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:03,510
there's no concept you know as far as

1652
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:05,309
the general public on these things and I

1653
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:07,380
think it's grown more and more every

1654
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:09,660
year and we just have to just constantly

1655
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:10,920
be beating that down in beating that in

1656
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:13,349
everyone's head talking to the

1657
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:16,440
dispensaries just letting everyone

1658
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:19,050
demanding it as a consumer but the more

1659
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:20,729
people come in contact and learn about

1660
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:22,409
these things there's only one direction

1661
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:23,759
nobody's all the sudden like now I'm

1662
01:13:22,409 --> 01:13:25,829
gonna go back to that you know chemi

1663
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,320
endure because that was working for me

1664
01:13:25,829 --> 01:13:29,640
like this region thing that there's only

1665
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:32,460
one direction I've never seen anyone

1666
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:36,289
like who really gets to like know the

1667
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:38,579
quality of living soil sun-grown like

1668
01:13:36,289 --> 01:13:40,500
amazing genetics of course to go with it

1669
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:41,930
too but like once you've experienced

1670
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,430
that you know there's not really

1671
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:46,380
backwards so I think it's a constant

1672
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:48,720
slope and it's all of us constantly

1673
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:50,940
talking to each other about supporting

1674
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,650
each other and and bringing each other

1675
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:54,689
up it has to be mutualistic so much

1676
01:13:52,649 --> 01:13:56,729
business it's like you know cutting the

1677
01:13:54,689 --> 01:13:58,739
other person down and why you're the

1678
01:13:56,729 --> 01:14:00,809
best and it's not like that in this

1679
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:02,849
movement it's why you know it's like

1680
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:04,560
supporting everyone's practices and

1681
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:06,770
because there's there's stuff to be

1682
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,970
learned from everyone and and

1683
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:11,090
celebrating the differences in the

1684
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:14,460
diversity and how that makes us stronger

1685
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:17,430
just as a group just constantly putting

1686
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:19,380
out the education and and hopefully the

1687
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:21,960
public supporting that it definitely

1688
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:24,029
feels like a David and Goliath situation

1689
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:26,730
and it's like oh man there's so much

1690
01:14:24,029 --> 01:14:27,750
endure everyone like they think okay

1691
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:29,759
something costs more to produce

1692
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:31,319
therefore it's been we're expensive

1693
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,119
therefore it must be better and that's

1694
01:14:31,319 --> 01:14:35,130
really frustrating to to see that

1695
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:38,789
attitude be so prevalent but at the same

1696
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:41,489
time watching this movement grow and

1697
01:14:38,789 --> 01:14:42,000
it's really been pretty rapid and

1698
01:14:41,489 --> 01:14:43,889
amazing

1699
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,899
it's it's really true that basically all

1700
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:48,060
you have to do is just like smoke at

1701
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:49,619
once and you'll make an effort to look

1702
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:51,900
for it in the future and so the more

1703
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:54,539
people that just know that this exists

1704
01:14:51,899 --> 01:14:56,460
and get a chance to try it the more it

1705
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:58,439
will become available because the demand

1706
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:00,000
just it yet like Jesse's that you don't

1707
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:02,339
go in the opposite direction once you go

1708
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,229
this way yeah I think the quality is

1709
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:07,500
what's really gonna help us prevail

1710
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:09,479
because you know one thing that I've

1711
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,310
noticed and and as I've become a farmer

1712
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:15,289
and when I drink wine I noticed this too

1713
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:18,780
is that people who use the same things

1714
01:15:15,289 --> 01:15:21,180
all their stuff tastes the same and so

1715
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:23,819
how do you differentiate yourself in the

1716
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:29,159
market when you're using the same recipe

1717
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:32,099
as six thousand other people or more and

1718
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:34,500
so when you are bringing out a unique

1719
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:37,370
quality of your place that doesn't taste

1720
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:41,550
like anybody else's place you know

1721
01:15:37,369 --> 01:15:45,510
whether you're trying to get a lower

1722
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:48,989
price and produce more and and you know

1723
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:51,449
process it in a in a more you know quick

1724
01:15:48,989 --> 01:15:54,090
manner or you're trying to do a smaller

1725
01:15:51,449 --> 01:15:57,000
batch that you're trying to really you

1726
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:59,369
know train those plants and and produce

1727
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,680
a quote product that's equal to what

1728
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:04,470
people expect of a top shelf indoor

1729
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:10,380
that's you know finely manicured and in

1730
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:11,909
taken care of you know basically that

1731
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:14,069
quality quality is going to

1732
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:16,199
differentiate you because your land is

1733
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:19,289
different from everybody else's land and

1734
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:22,670
whether you advertise your practices or

1735
01:16:19,289 --> 01:16:26,819
not that quality is gonna help you

1736
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:29,250
distinguish yourself and so we as a

1737
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:35,899
society and as an industry need to focus

1738
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:41,699
on quality above and be off absolutely

1739
01:16:35,899 --> 01:16:44,849
and and diversity so not just like

1740
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:49,649
growing tons of the same diet different

1741
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:52,380
same clones you know like seeds they all

1742
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:54,759
have different phenotypes so each

1743
01:16:52,380 --> 01:17:00,970
phenotype is special so

1744
01:16:54,760 --> 01:17:05,050
each plant is you know should be held to

1745
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:10,480
its full you know beaut being you know

1746
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:12,369
it's it's one seed it's it's not like

1747
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:16,139
any other it's like a snowflake you know

1748
01:17:12,369 --> 01:17:21,069
so it has all different properties and

1749
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:24,820
having diversity like that it could be a

1750
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:27,099
way we keeping in a niche market yeah

1751
01:17:24,819 --> 01:17:29,949
exactly it's it's about the niche market

1752
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:35,700
which I mean as as an industry as a

1753
01:17:29,949 --> 01:17:41,409
retail market space as as a regulatory

1754
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:43,300
policy there's as far as you know all of

1755
01:17:41,409 --> 01:17:45,279
these things as far as like the the

1756
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:46,930
ability of the small farmer or small

1757
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:48,729
business to operate as a regular small

1758
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:50,020
business we have no direct retail access

1759
01:17:48,729 --> 01:17:51,129
there's you have to be pretty clean

1760
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:53,230
degraded there's all these different

1761
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:54,489
things that don't make sense that we're

1762
01:17:53,229 --> 01:17:56,649
doing in our industry that aren't even

1763
01:17:54,489 --> 01:17:59,319
standard in all other industries and the

1764
01:17:56,649 --> 01:18:01,000
markups and the way the who has to take

1765
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:02,170
what cut out of where and and none of it

1766
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,729
makes any sense it's like we've been

1767
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:07,140
talking all weekend about how crazy this

1768
01:18:03,729 --> 01:18:10,479
is that we were all doing this but but

1769
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:13,210
at the same time they're you know the

1770
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:15,129
people who want the good weed and you

1771
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:17,770
know it and back in the day you know we

1772
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:19,239
would get that amazing bag and you it

1773
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:21,940
would just come to you magically because

1774
01:18:19,239 --> 01:18:23,679
you didn't have control over what you

1775
01:18:21,939 --> 01:18:25,509
would get necessarily maybe you knew a

1776
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:27,550
guy or your friend's cousin or whatever

1777
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:30,250
if you were lucky but but you know like

1778
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:32,260
you got this mate magic bag of weed and

1779
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:35,619
it was incredible and you were like whoa

1780
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:41,590
and one day we actually met the people

1781
01:18:35,619 --> 01:18:43,809
that grew our weed and it changed our

1782
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:45,520
lives forever and just I mean like with

1783
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:47,230
wine we we have a level of

1784
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,060
sophistication with the consumer now

1785
01:18:47,229 --> 01:18:50,829
where you can have that niche market

1786
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:51,940
really thrive and it's going to take

1787
01:18:50,829 --> 01:18:54,069
time and we don't even have our

1788
01:18:51,939 --> 01:18:57,579
Appalachians set at this point like it's

1789
01:18:54,069 --> 01:18:59,859
it's gonna be difficult and we're at the

1790
01:18:57,579 --> 01:19:02,079
beginning of a long road of development

1791
01:18:59,859 --> 01:19:04,809
as far as that and as far as consumer

1792
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:08,559
education as far as all of these things

1793
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:12,580
but there is a very very strong

1794
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:16,600
desire from all demographics of

1795
01:19:12,579 --> 01:19:19,630
consumers realistically for things that

1796
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:21,610
are natural that are pure that are

1797
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:26,590
healthy that are actually legitimately

1798
01:19:21,609 --> 01:19:29,619
clean and that are going to enhance

1799
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:32,279
their health because I think the latest

1800
01:19:29,619 --> 01:19:35,979
statistic I heard was like one in two

1801
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:41,109
people in the u.s. now have cancer it's

1802
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:43,299
one in two so it's it's again it just

1803
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:46,569
goes back to how all those things are

1804
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:49,390
connected but there there's a there's a

1805
01:19:46,569 --> 01:19:51,189
bridge that we still have to build and

1806
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:52,270
then get across and we're at the

1807
01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:55,359
beginning of that right now

1808
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:58,270
and the that that's just real reality

1809
01:19:55,359 --> 01:20:01,989
but we live really sustainably on our

1810
01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:04,180
farms so we're gonna be alright you were

1811
01:20:01,989 --> 01:20:06,039
no write it out you know for however

1812
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:08,200
long and whatever is gonna happen after

1813
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:10,060
that like I'd rather be on my farm than

1814
01:20:08,199 --> 01:20:13,059
anywhere if the shit hits the fan you

1815
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:14,980
know but but we want to help help it

1816
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:17,289
thrive and we we want to help them move

1817
01:20:14,979 --> 01:20:20,739
along as quickly as possible in consumer

1818
01:20:17,289 --> 01:20:24,010
advocacy and awareness or consumer

1819
01:20:20,739 --> 01:20:25,979
awareness and just how we get the

1820
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:28,600
knowledge out there is really what this

1821
01:20:25,979 --> 01:20:31,479
movement is about and what regenerative

1822
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:34,930
canvas farming org is about and why the

1823
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:40,179
Emerald cup made it such a priority to

1824
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:42,570
create an award specifically for how the

1825
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:45,579
farms are practicing and and really

1826
01:20:42,569 --> 01:20:47,559
centering around why that makes what we

1827
01:20:45,579 --> 01:20:50,140
do up here in Northern California so

1828
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:52,110
special and why ours that creates a

1829
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:55,119
uniqueness to our story that is

1830
01:20:52,109 --> 01:20:57,210
definitely marketable and the challenge

1831
01:20:55,119 --> 01:21:00,279
is yeah there's you know a lot of

1832
01:20:57,210 --> 01:21:03,159
capital going into all kinds of things

1833
01:21:00,279 --> 01:21:05,380
right now and it's gonna be a shit show

1834
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:08,139
for a while so it's really about like

1835
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:11,800
finding the other people on the other

1836
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:13,630
side that are all part of this that that

1837
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:18,070
care because definitely people all over

1838
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:19,770
the place really care Forest forest was

1839
01:21:18,069 --> 01:21:23,309
mentioning oh really

1840
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:23,310
the diversity

1841
01:21:26,119 --> 01:21:32,309
Forrest was mentioning the diversity or

1842
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:37,200
the uniqueness and the potential of that

1843
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:40,460
flower and you know like this jar what's

1844
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:44,039
in it is its high art and it can only

1845
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:46,230
exist this year in this wet you know

1846
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:49,409
like it's it's very unique that genetic

1847
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:53,549
expression in that environment from that

1848
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:58,229
has the love of the cultivator in it as

1849
01:21:53,550 --> 01:22:01,380
well as a diverse living system around

1850
01:21:58,229 --> 01:22:04,859
it that it gave to existence to then

1851
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:06,300
change your consciousness like I don't

1852
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:08,789
we're talking about things that change

1853
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:10,529
our consciousness like let's like let's

1854
01:22:08,789 --> 01:22:13,859
care about the process that went into

1855
01:22:10,529 --> 01:22:17,460
creating this like this is incredibly

1856
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:24,089
special art to me that I love I love

1857
