1
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,399
we're going to now drill in and ask a

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,679
few deeper questions to our panel

3
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,399
members and um at the end here we're

4
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,559
going to save a few minutes for

5
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:25,839
questions from the audience you just

6
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:27,719
stated that measure D was the worst

7
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,198
ordinance written in the history of the

8
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:33,679
world and then Paul caret admitted that

9
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:36,960
he wrote measure D what is your

10
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:40,920
relationship like today because of

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,878
this love mros as well I'm sorry I led

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,079
Mr caret and I love Mr rosenal as well

13
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:47,839
they're the only two councilmen that

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,558
actually work with us I don't think it

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,879
was his fault that it came out as bad as

16
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,759
it did but actually yeah it didn't

17
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:56,839
permit us it didn't protect us and and

18
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:59,399
and those of us that have limited

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,280
immunity what happens is that the cops

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,320
law enforce want to come and and

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,519
challenge us then we have to prove to

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,478
them that we have limited immunity and

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,280
then after that you know hopefully

24
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:12,319
they'll leave us alone right it's the

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,359
worst slob because it doesn't didn't

26
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,559
give us anything it it gave us the right

27
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,879
to exist under limited immunity but the

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:24,799
rest of the illegal clubs in Los Angeles

29
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:27,118
exist the same way you know so I'm

30
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,000
sorry but you have to agree with me that

31
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,040
it's it's really really bad and that we

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,399
have to fix it and the ordinance that

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,680
glaca wrote goes in hand in hand with

34
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,640
Mera and all the things that Mera say so

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,360
that we qualify and able to do that but

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,280
it is it was it is the worst legislation

37
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,959
for a city that I can imagine that could

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,359
ever exist hopefully things will be much

39
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,879
better going forward with the other

40
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,920
cities when they regulate now before

41
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,640
measure D passed you had gathered

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,359
signatures through glocka uh and put

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,599
your own measure on the ballot that was

44
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:01,118
measure e yes that is correct there was

45
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:04,640
also a measure f yes that is correct so

46
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:07,280
you had e d and f yeah was

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,199
great and can you talk about you have to

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,560
say d passes 60% of the voter and the

49
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,359
other two because we backed off of e so

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,640
we never you know advertised it or

51
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,879
anything and the F people I think got

52
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,399
like 30% or 40% I'm not sure I just know

53
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:24,799
that D got 62% of the votes so at least

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,039
we knew that the city and you know the

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,959
the the voters wanted medical marijuana

56
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,239
in fact we did uh a poll about 6 months

57
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,439
ago when we commissioned the new

58
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:37,239
ordinance and it came back at 82% 82% of

59
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,079
La voters that were pulled said that

60
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,959
medical marijuana should exist in the

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,840
city of Los Angeles so I mean we have

62
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,519
the people on our side it's just we need

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,200
to figure out how to do it so it's done

64
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,599
correctly as far as regulation is

65
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,639
concerned so in hindsight withdrawing

66
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,238
measure e do you believe that that was a

67
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,598
good decision at that time would you

68
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:59,080
still do that today yes we had to

69
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:00,560
because the city was putting up D and we

70
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,680
were told that if we didn't go with the

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,519
city we would never win so it was about

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,719
staying alive so we went with the city

73
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,120
we won by 62% of the vote it was bad but

74
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,359
it was

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,080
good but we're going to fix that we're

76
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,400
going to fix that in hopefully in March

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,920
so and so one week ago another

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,599
organization called the ucba trade

79
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,318
Association submitted 100,000 signatures

80
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,439
to place an initiative on the ballot for

81
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:27,158
March of

82
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:31,158
2017 this would allow priority licensing

83
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:33,079
to the 135 property uh dispensaries that

84
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:35,359
have limited immunity from prosecution

85
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,000
for being a dispensary um can you talk

86
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,000
about what you like or dislike with this

87
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,438
measure the fact that 135 dispensaries

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,280
will be grandfathered

89
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:49,680
in that's what I like about that measure

90
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,158
okay

91
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,360
um um we've decided glaca has decided

92
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,719
that in the interest of the patients and

93
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,560
our community in the city of Los Angeles

94
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,719
that we will work s side by side by the

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,920
city uh ucba has elected to walk another

96
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:10,479
path and all power to them

97
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,158
um the the things that are wrong with

98
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,719
ucba uh initiative and we're going to

99
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:18,159
say one is that if you AB but two

100
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,680
residences then you'll have to move so

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,840
there's a lot of dispensaries that are

102
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,120
propd the 135 or how many were left I

103
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:30,560
you said 65 I think 85 but anyway um

104
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,478
then those places will have to close CL

105
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,600
um it doesn't affect me because I don't

106
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,439
a but to Residents I have a dispensary

107
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,840
in in in uh Chatsworth um a property

108
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,279
dispensary so I don't a but to Residents

109
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,560
I have parking I have space none of the

110
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,159
stuff that's in the initiative affects

111
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,600
me personally or my dispensary the

112
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,520
problem is is that anybody that knows me

113
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,600
knows that I'm a prop D girl that's my

114
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,879
family those are the people that stepped

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,600
up and in my opinion are the ones that

116
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,560
should be grandfathered in because we

117
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,120
fought year after year after year to be

118
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,079
alive and to be recognized and so I

119
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,240
believe that the property dispensers

120
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,839
should be grandfathered in and I that's

121
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,560
the one thing that I agree with in their

122
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:15,359
initiative but you have a new feeling

123
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,000
now that you've already gone the route

124
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,879
of the initiative and you've gone the

125
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,038
route of compromise and um how do you

126
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,680
feel the best way to proceed uh with

127
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,519
implementing full Mera implementation

128
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,879
the way we've always proceeded working

129
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,918
with the city being their friend um

130
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,319
trying to educate them trying to come to

131
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:35,799
understandings together we don't want to

132
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,800
fight with them there's no reason to

133
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,360
anymore we don't have to talk them into

134
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,560
the fact that we're medical they already

135
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,960
know it you know so now it's all about

136
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,160
good regulation what we can live with

137
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,359
and and and that's it that's the bottom

138
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,360
line and I to me working with the city

139
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,199
working side by side with the city is

140
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,038
the best path for glocka to go and

141
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,639
that's what we've decided to do do you

142
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:57,639
now view an initiative as a

143
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,478
fight

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,680
um I

145
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,759
think that the initiative was brought on

146
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,840
like last time we wrote e to force the

147
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,520
city to write something and put it on

148
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,159
the ballot hopefully something better uh

149
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:20,519
we had to choose to go with the city

150
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,960
because that's the way that we had to go

151
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:26,000
um I like my

152
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:28,279
way I want to choose to continue to work

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,399
with the city side by side and giving

154
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:33,399
them the support and and education and

155
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,519
all the things that they need for us so

156
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,038
that they can then you know craft

157
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,038
something that'll be good for our

158
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,079
community and the community at large

159
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:43,800
thank you yumy and thank you so much for

160
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,038
everything that you have done over the

161
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,918
years you've helped so many people your

162
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,719
Powerhouse we're all grains of sand in

163
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,598
the pale and sometimes the pale fills up

164
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,080
with lots of grains of sand so fires can

165
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:59,719
be put out I'm just a grain in of sand

166
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,359
in the pale that's what I am and and I'm

167
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,720
just doing what I believe I should do

168
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,560
cannabis gave me back my life so now I'm

169
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,840
giving back to cannabis and she's humble

170
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
as

171
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,478
well thanks

172
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,160
yammi Paul in 2003 you were the

173
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:18,800
co-author of S420 which allowed the

174
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,360
collective model uh can you explain how

175
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,038
that idea came to be you know who

176
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,840
decided to put all of these different

177
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:29,839
entities together to allow what was then

178
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,038
uh commercial licensing

179
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,839
essentially well I I wish I could give

180
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:38,038
you a better explanation but I won't

181
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,839
take credit for much of it it was it was

182
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,000
the late Senator John

183
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,279
vasconcelos that really did all of the

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,038
work and the Coalition building around

185
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:51,239
that I think uh it was viewed that

186
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:54,360
215 uh was too vague and we needed to

187
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,079
actually provide some direction um

188
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,000
unfortunately uh there were a lot of

189
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,038
folks that were very squeamish about

190
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,879
supporting medical marijuana at all so

191
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:05,318
it wound up being a compromise measure

192
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,240
that was pretty vague uh that wasn't my

193
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,240
call my only real involvement was to

194
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,519
support it on the assembly side to be

195
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,960
the Principal co-author to get it passed

196
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,878
and so I'll take a little credit for

197
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,399
helping get it passed um I think it

198
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,080
probably should have been written a

199
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:24,038
little more clearly uh but then again I

200
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,639
had the same problem and same

201
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:28,800
opportunity in the city uh with a

202
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,000
council that was completely all over the

203
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,599
map um and and really there was no

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,120
consensus I think It ultimately got

205
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,759
consensus partly prop D because uh we

206
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,320
could see Bill rosendal and he was still

207
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:44,759
alive and still coming to Council

208
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,000
meetings because of medical marijuana

209
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:50,319
and and how much that helped him and so

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,839
I think it w it was too personal for for

211
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,839
some of the council members to vote

212
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,399
against him again it was it was vague

213
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,880
didn't deal with a lot of the issues

214
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,078
that I would have liked to have dealt

215
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,480
with but we were lucky honestly to get

216
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,359
it through the council this is not a

217
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,879
very supportive Council and we had some

218
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,159
members that were very strongly opposed

219
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:13,759
uh some just on on the basis of being

220
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,919
anti-marijuana but more most being being

221
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,639
responsive their constituents who

222
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,399
complained about some of the nuisance

223
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:23,078
Factor now a lot of that has changed uh

224
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,639
in a few years we've had uh more than

225
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:26,838
the majority of council change so a lot

226
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,639
of the folks that were really

227
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,880
anti-marijuana mostly are gone

228
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:35,559
um many of the council members have not

229
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:38,240
had to deal with the issue at all um so

230
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:41,078
I I think we actually have a more open

231
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,839
Council now also uh our council

232
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:45,719
president herb Wesson I think has helped

233
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,240
sort of take control of the issue and

234
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,160
he's trying to come up with something

235
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,079
reasonable uh he and I and another

236
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:56,000
council member ner Martinez led the

237
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:59,078
effort to put together a working group

238
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,639
to try and come up with answers um ultim

239
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:04,359
Ely uh uh we wound up not going with the

240
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,919
results of that working group but

241
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,600
deciding to have the rules committee

242
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:13,559
which uh council president Weston chairs

243
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,759
actually um make more of the decision on

244
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,439
where this goes so we're going to have

245
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:21,159
three major public hearings try to get

246
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,240
input that way um I think since the

247
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:25,799
working group we've gotten a lot of

248
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,399
input from folks in parts of the city

249
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:30,799
that don't have a lot of dispensaries um

250
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,360
we've got a lot of input from folks that

251
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,319
we want more women-owned dispensaries we

252
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,200
want more minority-owned

253
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,720
dispensaries um and hopefully more

254
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,920
dispensaries in general than the either

255
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,079
85 or 135 so I'm not sure which

256
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,838
direction this is going to go in but I'm

257
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,519
hopeful at the end we address all the

258
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,440
intuitive things that we should address

259
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,240
like cultivation like Transportation

260
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,480
like delivery um like having access

261
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,720
throughout the city and not just where

262
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,278
people perceive the most money to be

263
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,079
made or whatever um so there's an

264
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,519
overabundance in my district and there's

265
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,719
some areas that have virtually none so

266
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,639
we'll try to correct all those what we

267
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,000
do with the initiative I'm not entirely

268
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,360
sure because we may just have an

269
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,360
ordinance to deal with this or we may

270
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,360
put an initiative on the ballot um to

271
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,879
try and pass our vision rather than the

272
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,680
vision of a group that happened to put

273
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,120
it on the ballot um or we may pass an

274
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,319
ordinance before and then ask La voters

275
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,200
to turn down what's on the ballot

276
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,760
because we've already dealt with this

277
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,959
appropriately it's it's all all very

278
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:40,439
much up in the air uh but hopefully at

279
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,239
the end of the day we'll do the right

280
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,240
thing and and put uh the vagueness of

281
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,440
this issue to bed so there's basically

282
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,959
many directions that this could go in in

283
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,800
fixing measure D you have an initiative

284
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,399
that could be on the ballot in March in

285
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,559
a special election you may issue your

286
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,159
own to compete with that or you may just

287
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,559
try to come together and create create

288
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:04,759
your own ordinance and in theory I think

289
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,559
we can also adopt what's been proposed

290
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,519
so that we don't have to put it in the

291
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,239
ballot we can just agree with it and and

292
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,639
implement it so that's also technically

293
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,198
a possibility but I think there's some

294
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,720
issues that that that initiative doesn't

295
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:20,799
deal with and I think we'll want to try

296
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:24,360
and resolve everything all in one

297
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,958
shot thank you um what advice could you

298
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,639
give to our audience members that are

299
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,879
currently trying to Advocate their local

300
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:33,440
elected officials in order to persuade

301
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:35,879
them to regulate instead of banning this

302
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,120
industry I don't know I'm not sure uh

303
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,480
whether I had great results or not I

304
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,240
think most of the the worst things that

305
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,039
were proposed didn't happen only because

306
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,399
we saw legal threats in every wrong

307
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,958
direction that we looked as well as some

308
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,559
of the right ones um but I think

309
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,078
certainly in terms of medical marijuana

310
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:57,278
uh to the extent that you can

311
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:00,919
personalize it and there are people that

312
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:03,399
are still alive or being well treated um

313
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:05,439
because of medical marijuana people that

314
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,559
are dealing better with cancer people

315
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,279
that are dealing better with HIV and

316
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:14,039
AIDS and the host of of medical issues

317
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:17,000
that can be helped um I think that's the

318
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:20,759
most compelling uh I don't have anything

319
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,480
against proposition 64 but I I think the

320
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:25,799
uh the fact that people are actually

321
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,519
helped and and stay alive I think is the

322
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,000
most compelling argument in its favor

323
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,600
now there are some areas that are very

324
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,039
depressed economically and the fact that

325
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,159
there may be more jobs and more economic

326
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:40,919
activity uh may work in some areas that

327
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,519
uh that I'm not used to thinking about

328
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,799
um but I don't think that's the answer

329
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,399
certainly in the in the greater LA area

330
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,679
I think the the the strongest argument

331
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,399
is that it can help your constituents

332
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,919
stay alive stay healthier um and that's

333
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,039
certainly the argument that I use

334
00:13:54,919 --> 00:14:00,759
because that's what I care about

335
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,759
myself thank you Paul

336
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,879
Janine Long Beach has a very convoluted

337
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,239
history with regulating marijuana just a

338
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,958
little bit can you talk a little bit

339
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,560
about the history of that sure um so

340
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,599
much of this I was kind of on the

341
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:22,399
sidelines watching and and like many in

342
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,240
Long Beach assuming that because we are

343
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,519
uh quote unquote Progressive City that

344
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,759
we would uh more easily be able to

345
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,759
regulate uh medicinal marijuana than

346
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:37,480
other cities but what we found is in

347
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,639
2010 uh we had uh my predecessor suja

348
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,199
lenthal along with other council members

349
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:45,360
decided that they wanted to move forward

350
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:47,599
uh with regulation and in 2010 they went

351
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,159
forward with a application process and I

352
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,800
have dates down just cuz I don't like

353
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,198
the pros are in the room so I don't want

354
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,758
to mess this up y these are like the

355
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:57,679
guys that have been doing this work so

356
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,199
you guys can correct me

357
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:04,319
okay

358
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:06,319
um in 2012 uh they actually we banned

359
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,079
medicinal marijuana because the city was

360
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,920
sued uh and at that time that lawsuit

361
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:15,319
went up to the California Supreme Court

362
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:18,919
and it was uh kicked down um denied and

363
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,759
so in 2012 what they did uh the industry

364
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:23,479
guys they went out and tried to put a

365
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,959
ballot measure together uh to adjust

366
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,839
this uh ban and they were shy 18

367
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:32,679
signatures 18 signat and so the city

368
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,800
council said obviously uh we are in a

369
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:37,439
city that supports uh regulation and so

370
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:39,439
they gave it to the Planning Commission

371
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,880
it went through a process we put

372
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,440
together a task force uh and in that

373
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:49,078
time we had uh elections and so we had a

374
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,279
turnover with some council members and I

375
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:51,838
believe and this was not what my

376
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:53,838
industry guys wanted me to say but

377
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,560
that's too bad uh I believe what

378
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,000
happened was that we had a shift in

379
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:00,518
culture uh from a a city that was saying

380
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,278
okay we wanted do the right thing uh and

381
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,720
trying to figure out the details and

382
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:06,679
trying to work with uh organized

383
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,440
industry trying to work with uh small

384
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,879
business owners to find out what was the

385
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,360
best model and I think this goes to what

386
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,159
uh council member caret is saying is

387
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,360
that you have intention to do good uh

388
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:18,519
but you don't know what the outcome is

389
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,639
going to be and in addition to what the

390
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,799
outcome is going to be you have to talk

391
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:26,198
about messaging and how we frame it and

392
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,838
so during that time of trying to come

393
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,719
back and say okay we want to go ahead as

394
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,040
a council and put together an ordinance

395
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,560
that wouldn't go on the ballot but that

396
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,120
the council would have the ability to

397
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,198
vote on the good thing about doing that

398
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,679
is that the council can then make

399
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,039
adjustments should there be a a negative

400
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,278
impact that you hadn't planned on the

401
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,799
council can then take another vote

402
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,919
adjust the ordinance uh and so that is

403
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,838
the the good thing about doing it uh

404
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,278
with the

405
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,560
council uh we have a a new council

406
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:59,198
member and a lot of frame around uh

407
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:01,198
Public Safety and that frame has kind of

408
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,719
gotten a wedge within our city council

409
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,438
where we felt like we were on the right

410
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,600
path we then have this conversation

411
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,199
about Public Safety that that has to be

412
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,599
number one it's no longer the

413
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,400
conversation changed from being about uh

414
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:17,198
medicinal purposes it changed from the

415
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,120
stories of you know Joey or Martha or

416
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,360
other people that would be impacted and

417
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,759
it changed to just about public safety

418
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,399
and this is why you guys in the industry

419
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,519
is so important to be able to come back

420
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,960
and give us uh facts like the fact that

421
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,558
the UCLA uh said

422
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,840
did a study a 5-year study where they

423
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:35,599
went outside of dispensaries and said

424
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,759
okay what what's crime happening and

425
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,959
what are the impacts of having

426
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,599
dispensaries in our neighborhood and

427
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,319
came back with no significant

428
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,079
correlation in crime increasing and so

429
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,038
we know whenever we regulate uh from

430
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:50,319
talking to you guys from making sure

431
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:52,519
we're working with industry um education

432
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,639
centers that when we do that together we

433
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:57,240
can have the facts that it has to be

434
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,720
about medicine and it has to be about

435
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,359
what's really happening on the ground

436
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,558
and taking away the fear taking away the

437
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,798
fear of what an impact might be to have

438
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:08,399
uh these shops in our neighborhoods and

439
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:10,158
so we tried to go through that process

440
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,919
we were I remember that night very

441
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,360
clearly we're at Council we thought we

442
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,600
had a vote uh on an ordinance that had

443
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:19,759
been worked on since 2010 you know going

444
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,199
back and forth with City attorney with

445
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,558
council with Mayors we thought we were

446
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,038
going to have a vote and unfortunately

447
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,599
there was a lot of opportunity to try to

448
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,400
as we talk about find that middle ground

449
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,558
and it's hard to find a middle ground on

450
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,798
something like medicine it's hard to

451
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,319
find a middle ground on something like

452
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:40,759
medicine that it's really the outcome

453
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,399
has to be the best interest of the

454
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,519
patients and the best interest of

455
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,080
residents uh and not you know pandering

456
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:51,519
to uh one uh type of of special interest

457
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:54,319
or another but it has to be on on that

458
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,879
basis and so we came down to trying to

459
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,000
get to that middle of the road and I'm

460
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,840
really proud of some of my colleagues

461
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,558
um who are now my colleagues um that

462
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,959
said you know what we're not going to go

463
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:08,359
down the middle path we're not going to

464
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,440
um you know say only delivery and no

465
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:13,319
shops we're not going to say only four

466
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,840
delivery services or only four shops and

467
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,798
we're not going to do that and I know

468
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:18,000
that that was a hard night but you know

469
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,879
essentially they threw their hands up

470
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,440
and said we we can't come to consensus

471
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,679
on what a good policy would be for our

472
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,400
city and so uh folks got together they

473
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,200
put uh they collected you know thousands

474
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,600
of signatures and now we have on the

475
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,919
ballot uh in November measure mm which

476
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:38,319
is regulating uh medicinal marijuana

477
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:41,799
allowing for shops to be Citywide also

478
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:43,639
regulating um grow and dispensaries and

479
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:46,918
Retail we're looking at somewhere

480
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,640
between 800,000 jobs and we're looking

481
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,120
at making sure that residents can have

482
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,120
access to their

483
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:56,399
medicine and they even it repeals the

484
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,239
old uh ban it repeals the old taxes and

485
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,240
it puts in place a new tax and for

486
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,798
retail it's like between 6 and

487
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,720
8% uh which you know personally we know

488
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:09,599
that that taxing medicine is it's a

489
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,279
little it's hard to do you know legally

490
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,000
there's some questions there but also

491
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,599
just in your gut should we be taxing

492
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,679
medicine whenever it's about making sure

493
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,279
people have uh access to that and so I

494
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:24,600
think the industry did a great job about

495
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:27,359
making this policy uh very

496
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,759
uh you know that has a longer distance

497
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,719
from schools

498
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:32,480
uh making sure that it's very highly

499
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,839
regulated for an industry to put this on

500
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,679
and so we have measure mm on the ballot

501
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,959
now uh that you know we know is going to

502
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,640
pass we just we need to make sure we do

503
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,798
all the work I'm committed to doing the

504
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,240
work with those guys um making sure that

505
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:48,558
that passes and what's been fascinating

506
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:51,679
is that the the district that has fought

507
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,720
the hardest against uh any kind of

508
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,280
conversation around marijuana is the

509
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,000
district that has the highest percent of

510
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,440
support and it's amazing what polls can

511
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,038
do you know it's amazing what polls can

512
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,440
do and so I think part of it is also

513
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,599
sharing that information and making sure

514
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,120
that that elected leaders know that

515
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,639
their constituents support things like

516
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,599
this instead of living in a bubble of

517
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,320
fear uh about what might be in addition

518
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,319
to measure mm the the mayor and the city

519
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:22,599
council put on uh another initiative uh

520
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:27,158
to tax uh medical and recreational at a

521
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:28,599
higher level should 64 and mm pass and

522
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:29,760
that happened really quick

523
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,719
you know it came to the floor really

524
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,400
quickly by the way anytime there's

525
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,200
marijuana on the agenda in Long Beach

526
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,840
it's kind of crazy it's a long night

527
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,558
there's a ton of people so I get just to

528
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:44,240
give you a little bit of information I

529
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:46,678
get sworn in and my first three Council

530
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,240
meetings all had marijuana on the agenda

531
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:52,400
every single one of them and it was you

532
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,558
know I'm all about jumping in feet first

533
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,320
and so one of them was the tax

534
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,879
initiative that we we put on the ballot

535
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:01,480
measure Ma and and it is tough because I

536
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,039
want to make sure that our city has the

537
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,558
resources that that we need when we have

538
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:08,839
a new industry coming in There's an

539
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:11,000
opportunity for new Revenue um and this

540
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:13,639
initiative now says that the city can

541
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,759
tax at higher rates so it can go 8 to 10

542
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:20,278
for medical or 10 to 12 for recreational

543
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:22,480
or adult use uh and so we get to come

544
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:24,000
back and have that debate again but I

545
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,960
think the challenge is how we have that

546
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,720
debate in and making sure it's rooted in

547
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,798
in facts and numbers and what the real

548
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,798
need is in our city is the need more

549
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:36,038
police officers if if crime is going

550
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:37,759
down whenever we regulate is the need

551
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:40,038
really more police officers or is the

552
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,599
need uh to spend those dollars in some

553
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:45,119
re-entry support uh for people that will

554
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:47,240
be coming out of jail or no longer uh

555
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,879
you know having a probation hit or

556
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,640
something like that so let's have a

557
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,000
fruitful conversation about what that

558
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,960
looks like uh where the real needs are

559
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,480
and this is again for industry to step

560
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,919
up and and and talk with us about what

561
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,640
those opport unities are but also

562
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,799
reaching out to unlikely allies to say

563
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,960
what is it what is your experience with

564
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:06,240
people coming out of the criminal

565
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,640
justice system and where are the most

566
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,480
need because we know the cities right

567
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,240
now are struggling with that and so we

568
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,240
want to support uh our residents we want

569
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,960
to make sure things are safe and I think

570
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,880
regulating is the best way to do that as

571
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,440
long as we're doing smart regulation and

572
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,760
we're doing it for the right reasons and

573
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,440
so yeah we have a little bit of a a you

574
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,000
know difficult background but I think

575
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,759
looking at what all the cities have done

576
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,079
we've had an opportunity to learn from

577
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,879
that and hopefully um you know move

578
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,319
forward in the in the right direction so

579
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,480
it does sound like you're moving forward

580
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,480
so thank you so much for your

581
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:44,720
work in the midst of what some of us in

582
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:48,519
the industry dubbed bana paloa in

583
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,440
January voted 0 to regulate the Cannabis

584
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:53,599
industry and shortly after that you

585
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,240
began talking about selling your

586
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,959
abandoned prison to a marijuana extract

587
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,159
company how did that convers ation

588
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,278
begin okay so I actually went through

589
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,799
minutes trying to figure this all out

590
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:08,640
cuz it's been 7 months or eight months

591
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,639
of this and it's got a little bit

592
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,480
convoluted so in our first meeting in

593
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,960
January we were brought with the

594
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,960
decision to regulator ban across the

595
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,840
board um all the different things

596
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,880
dispensaries cultivation personal

597
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:27,558
cultivation Delivery Systems that type

598
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,760
of thing and uh we voted 0 to go forward

599
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:32,278
with it because we had a crowd of people

600
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:37,158
that were there that were in

601
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:38,480
support and the very next meeting in I

602
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:42,440
believe it was in

603
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,798
February we had the darn near the exact

604
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,600
opposite the word had gotten out that we

605
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,759
had voted to do this and a crowd of the

606
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,319
exact opposite came and they held our

607
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:55,038
feet to the fire which I commend them

608
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:58,519
for doing so because it helped us in the

609
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:00,759
process we did not argue with them we

610
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:03,200
listened to them that was the most

611
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:06,200
important thing and for anyone looking

612
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,399
how to succeed in a city uh turning on

613
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,360
your listening ears and listening and

614
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:14,599
writing down what the fears are of the

615
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:17,519
people will help you gain uh some kind

616
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:20,480
of idea of what you can do to compromise

617
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,038
and life as a councilman and government

618
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,319
and local government is all about

619
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:28,440
compromise regardless of whether we like

620
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:30,639
that or not and so moving forward

621
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,278
our people told us all the issues that

622
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,399
they had with a dispensary because

623
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:36,278
that's what we were we were set to do

624
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:38,398
that's what our 50 vote was we were

625
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:41,640
going to allow a dispensary in the city

626
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:43,879
of Kinga that has about 15,000 people

627
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,960
and so we we listened to the medical

628
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,600
needs the compassion and then at the

629
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,000
second meeting we listened to the people

630
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:53,398
that said about their concerns with

631
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,599
crime we had three different agencies I

632
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:58,000
believe the college the school and the

633
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:01,678
parks and wreck all wrote resolutions

634
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,558
against what we were doing uh one guy

635
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,038
said that we were prostituting out our

636
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:07,558
town amazingly enough that was a hard

637
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:11,960
one to

638
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:13,200
take so um we had businesses come in and

639
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,600
said that they thought that this would

640
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,480
bring the wrong element of people to our

641
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,759
town

642
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,000
um we went forward knowing this

643
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,640
information and we held workshops we

644
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,278
held like two Workshops the first

645
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,360
Workshop was kind of a back and forth we

646
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:34,000
brought in um Mr Michael Green from the

647
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:36,519
fres uh Fresno cannabis club and he went

648
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,599
to town on Mera that was very

649
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:42,440
interesting that was like a hour

650
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,519
fixation on the law and amazingly enough

651
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,200
a lot of our residents that were against

652
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:51,759
this uh after they realized that the law

653
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,720
was in support of these angles their

654
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:58,359
mind started to turn a little bit like

655
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,720
hey hm it's not just a deal deal where

656
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,439
the federal government is against it and

657
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,798
you guys are going to try and operate

658
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,798
outside of federal law uh once we he

659
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:11,240
explained Mera things started to change

660
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,119
in people's minds but not you know it

661
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,240
wasn't like a night and day thing it was

662
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,959
kind of like you know we're listening

663
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,880
we're understanding and we're hearing

664
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,798
and we know that there's people we're

665
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,880
understanding that there's a medical

666
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:25,639
need but we're we still have security

667
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:29,200
concerns on our I think it's our March

668
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:33,159
30th meeting we had a company called

669
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,759
Ocean Grown extracts and they put an

670
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:39,278
offer in on the prison right then in

671
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:41,000
there well amazing yeah they they they

672
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:44,599
sent it in and it was on our close

673
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,038
session agenda and people were following

674
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:48,119
you know we went from having one or two

675
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:50,278
people at Council meetings to having it

676
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,918
full people said that they couldn't

677
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:53,319
trust us that's what they said we can't

678
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,120
trust you we're coming to council I was

679
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:56,480
like wow you know this is how we get

680
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:59,798
people to show up for the local

681
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,440
government I was kind of amazed at that

682
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:03,639
like maybe we're doing something right

683
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,519
here you know we want people to be

684
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,000
involved uh locally so we had that close

685
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:11,038
session agenda item and it was to sell

686
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,880
the prison but we have discussion at the

687
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,839
same time uh about the the marijuana

688
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:20,559
thing and we started to

689
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:22,798
reframe the idea into cannabis we

690
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:25,038
followed lead and rooll we council

691
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,558
members uh started doing some research

692
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,919
on this myself I started looking at you

693
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:31,960
know listening to the public actually to

694
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,840
be honest with you the public kept using

695
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,079
the word marijuana and they kept tying

696
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:40,079
all the bad things to what this word was

697
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:42,359
so I started watching and attending

698
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,480
meetings for other councils and Other

699
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:45,719
Board of Supervisors and I was listening

700
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,319
to the crowd and the people and they

701
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,480
were using the word

702
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:52,319
cannabis and that to me was a

703
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,759
GameChanger it was kind of like when

704
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,480
they used to call them drugstores and

705
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,398
now they call themes how they changed

706
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,919
yeah they nice little change right there

707
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:03,918
right so I started we started change

708
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,919
that narrative and change the narrative

709
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:10,159
into cannabis and at the time that that

710
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:12,840
the city of Kinga which I'll tell you

711
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,360
our city was primarily into the oil

712
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:20,038
industry Kinga had a nice oil boom and

713
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:22,918
we also had a very nice um prison

714
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:24,480
industry um and I say nice because it

715
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,480
provides it provided people with a lot

716
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,880
of jobs and there was a lot of people

717
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,640
like me that were against the prisons

718
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,960
when they came in were're saying hey you

719
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,360
want to talk about bringing the wrong

720
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,278
kind of people this is going to bring

721
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:40,599
the wrong kind of people and it

722
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:42,720
did and so when AB 109 passed and one of

723
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:44,480
the other propositions and it basically

724
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,720
said hey you got to dump these these

725
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,200
prisons a lot of them because you're

726
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,000
going to dump we're going to take people

727
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,880
and not put them into prisons for this

728
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,919
and uh when Arnold Schwarz neger wrote

729
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,000
his thing and basically decriminalized

730
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,640
major portion of marijuana um what

731
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,599
happened was is the states weren't

732
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,559
willing to renew contracts with a lot of

733
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,038
the prisons the city of Kinga had a

734
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,639
private prison it was called Claremont

735
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:10,519
custody Center and we staffed the prison

736
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,240
and we charged for bed space and when

737
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,359
the prison went down and we could no

738
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,839
longer do that uh that prison was

739
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:19,759
providing about a million dollars of

740
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,599
Revenue into our community now I know

741
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,079
that medical patients and medical people

742
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,639
don't want to hear about the revenue

743
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:28,519
portion of this but let me explain why

744
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,159
this is important for Kinga because we

745
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,798
had fiveyear period where we were losing

746
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,440
a million dollars a year and we had

747
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,918
citizens that had moved there that learn

748
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,759
to like police and fire like hey we need

749
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,759
these Services there's police officers

750
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:44,720
there when we need them and firemen and

751
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:47,599
ambulances take us to the hospital well

752
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,079
we're in a huge problem here is like 75%

753
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,199
of most General funds in small

754
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:52,798
communities go to police and fire when

755
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,480
you lose a million dollars you have two

756
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:58,038
choices you can either cut or you can

757
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,720
create Revenue well

758
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:03,638
me being in business myself I understand

759
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,839
population is a huge deal population

760
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:07,240
make uh in location you know those are

761
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,638
your two things when you look at factors

762
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,960
of creating a business well Kinga is not

763
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:14,158
in a very good location we're probably

764
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,159
12 miles from the I5 we are centrally

765
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,519
located but we're kind of like in this

766
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,080
desert oil kind of community which you

767
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,440
know if without a good population

768
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,158
doesn't make a lot of people want to

769
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,720
come there when they can go to places

770
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,639
like Hanford and Fresno that are larger

771
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,360
populations and sit closer to the to the

772
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:35,638
I5 the corridors and whatnot so we had

773
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,079
these two industries the oil industry

774
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:40,759
and the prison industry the prison

775
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:43,038
industry got taken away the drought came

776
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,278
across and hit us really really hard a

777
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:47,720
lot of our farming Community we lost

778
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:51,119
that and then the oil companies start to

779
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,519
pull out and so Council has given this

780
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,079
opportunity and saying hey what do we do

781
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,798
you know we're moving from the January

782
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,918
1st we're going to February we're going

783
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,558
to March March and the narrative had to

784
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,159
change at some point in time because we

785
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:05,720
weren't going anywhere with the battle

786
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,278
back and forth with medical marijuana we

787
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,480
may have gained a couple percentage of

788
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:10,960
people who said yes this is a good idea

789
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,319
and we didn't think so beforehand

790
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,840
because they watched the videos of the

791
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,960
kids seizing and and having a change

792
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,599
they watched the videos of PBS putting

793
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,960
on saying that cancer cells can be

794
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,879
killed with THC you know we put the pl

795
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,759
the plaster County video out there to

796
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,159
help you know get some people but that

797
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,599
wasn't the GameChanger the game Cher was

798
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,399
when you when you tell people we can

799
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,959
provide opportunity opportunity in

800
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,798
growth in the economy to fill a void

801
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,159
what that was that was left behind by

802
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,960
other business that's when I'm not

803
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:42,840
kidding I seen the look on the people's

804
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,720
faces and they were like you know we

805
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:47,319
need need jobs and so you hold on you're

806
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,480
not talking about bringing a dispensary

807
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:50,960
to town so that's when it changed when

808
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,278
we stopped talking about bringing a

809
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,399
dispensary and Ocean Grown start talking

810
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,839
about purchasing our prison now I know

811
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:58,599
that a lot of people may not agree with

812
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,319
those that tactic and think to

813
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:02,158
themselves well that doesn't provide the

814
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,359
the need for the patient but we were

815
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,679
trying to look at an overall and if we

816
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,278
can get a company to come in that's

817
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,960
going to make medicine that's a step in

818
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:13,159
the door that's a a foot in the right

819
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,360
direction and then you know so that's

820
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:19,320
where we that's where we are we sold the

821
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:21,599
prison uh $4.1 million uh that should

822
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:24,200
take care of our initial uh in debt so

823
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,719
the city of Kingo will be out of debt

824
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,919
and then after well in doing that

825
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,798
process we had to create an ordinance

826
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,360
well the way that we wanted to create

827
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:35,079
the ordinance uh we had a lot of back

828
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,759
and forth on and so what we wanted to do

829
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,879
is we wanted to get them in business in

830
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:42,278
a in a quick amount of time because of

831
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,320
our financial needs like we had

832
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:45,720
suggested going to calfire to get rid of

833
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,079
our fire department not because we

834
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,759
wanted to but because we couldn't afford

835
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:51,359
it and we found out it was going to be

836
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:53,558
more expensive and so you know we really

837
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,240
have a big Financial draw of eight of

838
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:57,839
negative $800,000 a year that we are

839
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,440
negative in the whole that led up to

840
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:04,439
that 4 I mean that $3.6 million deficit

841
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,399
and so the financial goal was first and

842
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,960
I'm sorry to say that to everybody but

843
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,799
that was the truth you know Financial

844
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,960
goal was first but it doesn't stop the

845
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,240
rest of the agenda which is getting the

846
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,838
people the medicine and changing the

847
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,959
outcome of how cannabis affects

848
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:23,719
everybody in this room and everyone that

849
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,240
could be having the Cannabis to be used

850
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:29,519
as medicine so when we create our

851
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,398
ordinance we did an interm or an urgency

852
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:35,320
ordinance that urgency ordinance allowed

853
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:37,638
for everyone that was in that zone which

854
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,200
I think it was light manufacturing

855
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,159
industrial to be able to participate we

856
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,918
had a couple different places that were

857
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,240
close to close to school so we put in

858
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:50,078
the ordinance that had to be 1,800 ft

859
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,799
away from a school we our ordinance is a

860
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,240
little bit more stringent than Mera uh

861
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,119
and the reason was is because our

862
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,959
citizens required that in order to to

863
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,720
move forward and we thought that that

864
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,760
would be prudent to do that and then

865
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:03,759
when we're talking to the industry folks

866
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,280
they wanted protection from law

867
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,640
enforcement and our city seem to be a

868
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,560
very unique opportunity where you still

869
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,039
hear of counties getting raided today

870
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:14,639
because you have multiple Sheriff

871
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,039
agencies you have multiple federal

872
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,838
agencies teaming up with Sheriff

873
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:19,159
agencies that are going around and

874
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,559
they're picking off the people in the

875
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:22,920
counties even if you have a big if you

876
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:25,880
have a big County and has multiple

877
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,960
Sheriff operations one might not talk to

878
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,559
the other and then they go and they they

879
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,800
hit that type of thing so Kinga we're

880
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,119
trying to create a safe place with

881
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,720
regulation and whatnot and I think that

882
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,880
there's going to be a lot of opportunity

883
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,838
in the Central Valley for that type of

884
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,039
thing and we opened up this new area

885
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,480
that we've I think we're going to

886
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,800
probably have five or 10 companies come

887
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,800
in and uh there's still opportunity for

888
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,240
anyone that's in this industry you know

889
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,200
I think the Central Valley would be a

890
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,919
great place for you guys to come and I

891
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:56,598
want to thank everyone here for giving

892
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,800
us your ideas thank you very much thank

893
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,800
you

894
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,039
Nathan Don you currently have an interim

895
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,200
ordinance in place allowing one acre of

896
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:09,880
outdoor cultivation what are some of the

897
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:12,480
pitfalls you are facing as a regulator

898
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,680
in implementing this

899
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,159
ordinance I think some I'd like to talk

900
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:18,519
about some of the challenges that we're

901
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,358
grappling with but first I just want to

902
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:22,239
congratulate Nathan what they've done is

903
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:24,799
they've they've taken a prison that used

904
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,919
to house pot offenders and people who

905
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,960
were Brown and Brock people who were

906
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,920
captured as a part of this criminal

907
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,280
mentality that that prohibition has

908
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:38,800
created and they've sold it to to help

909
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,800
their city and to produce medicinal

910
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,880
cannabis that's just that's incredible

911
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:46,480
and this is one of the Delights is of

912
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,880
attending conference like this is to

913
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,159
learn from from each other so I I really

914
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,760
appreciate that so our ordinance is a we

915
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:57,679
we wanted to we're seeing this through

916
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,960
largely the lens of Agriculture and

917
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,719
those other lenses that you can look at

918
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,880
uh the current state of cannabis through

919
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:07,318
medicinal what's happening for patients

920
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,000
how do we get the best e efficacy for

921
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:11,679
the for the for the medicine or we can

922
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,880
look at it as revenue or we can look at

923
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:16,078
it as public safety and social justice

924
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,960
all these issues we're one of the

925
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,640
because we're an agricultural County and

926
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,000
what our County government deals with is

927
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:25,118
unincorporated areas outside the cities

928
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,440
outside the built areas the industrial

929
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,599
areas and Commercial spaces are all in

930
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,079
the incorporated city so we're dealing

931
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,960
with outdoor with with I heard the

932
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,079
phrase the other day Su grown or outdoor

933
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,280
grow areas so we're dealing with with

934
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,880
agricultural settings and we're dealing

935
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,680
with a lot of lack of information

936
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,519
misunderstandings among

937
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,440
ourselves uh and and certainly among the

938
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:50,440
communities that that uh that we're that

939
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,838
we're working with we're also dealing

940
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,079
with people who have in many cases have

941
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:58,000
been growing in the in the fields and

942
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,519
hills and forests for some time and are

943
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,599
interacting with their neighbors on a

944
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,679
regular basis and have found already

945
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,559
some some peace and ways of ways of

946
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:10,519
dealing so some of the so our the

947
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:13,838
ordinance has a, ft away from any uh

948
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:16,199
school or sensitive such such such kind

949
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:18,039
of sensitive area where children are are

950
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:20,199
likely to congregate so thousand feet

951
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:22,800
away and then we have in order to

952
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:25,919
address the the most common concerns

953
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,760
that we knew about of odor and noise and

954
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,240
Light we have a 75 ft from any grow site

955
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,240
to any uh structure that's occupied on a

956
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:38,919
neighboring property so it's very simple

957
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:41,279
kinds of conditions that that go into

958
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,800
effect now since it's an interim

959
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,640
ordinance we're taking the time now to

960
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,280
go and talk with each of the communities

961
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:49,358
so we've had Town Hall meetings in

962
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,400
several places and we hear it's very

963
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,759
interesting because the the fears as

964
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,119
Nathan mentioned you hear the fears from

965
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,160
people but often times in the same

966
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:59,440
comment

967
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:01,879
before they even take a breath to change

968
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,960
to another sentence someone will say I'm

969
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,680
against this I don't like this at all

970
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,800
and how do I get into the business and

971
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:12,838
it's it's so we're see we're hearing

972
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,960
that kind of of mindset changing even

973
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:16,719
while we while we're talking to folks so

974
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,639
some of the challenges that we've got As

975
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,639
in in agriculture we want to make sure

976
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,799
that we're dealing with water quality

977
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,440
issues that we're that we're providing

978
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,200
the best advice and the and the most and

979
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,760
the safest regulation framework for

980
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,399
pesticide applications so those are two

981
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,520
very importants that's an agricultural

982
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,200
commodity and our agricultural

983
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:39,119
commissioner is very is is very involved

984
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,239
in this he's the he's our our thought

985
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,280
leader in our County government and he's

986
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:46,959
also the the glue the connector between

987
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,319
our County regulatory apparatus the

988
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,000
Board of Supervisors the planning people

989
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:54,119
the environmental health people and the

990
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,559
grower community and so John John Young

991
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,880
is is the gentleman's name he's he's

992
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,920
been out listening to everybody and then

993
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,680
he takes their their views and he's

994
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,880
starting to he's doing something you

995
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:09,639
don't see in government hardly ever he's

996
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,440
sharing uh interim drafts or or draft

997
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:14,000
ordinance language he says okay you're

998
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,000
concerned about residency so here's what

999
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,440
it would look like if we put residency

1000
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,920
language in the permanent ordinance now

1001
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,599
residency is a very weird and

1002
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,039
interesting thing that where where some

1003
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:26,480
people would say well we don't want

1004
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:27,960
Outsiders to come into our little County

1005
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,599
and buy up all the property because

1006
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,960
they're going to put these massive

1007
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,920
speculative pressures on the property

1008
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,079
prices and that's going to price out the

1009
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,000
organic farmers who are raising foods

1010
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,599
for our community supported agriculture

1011
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and so on so we've got that's a real

1012
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,200
issue for us so people are talking about

1013
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,880
ways of addressing it residency comes up

1014
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:50,078
as as one of them another is that in

1015
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,079
order to achieve these uh the the

1016
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,920
buffers that we're talking about in some

1017
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,800
cases you have to have a certain creates

1018
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,000
a de facto minimum size for a for a

1019
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,240
property parcel well that's an effect on

1020
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,119
some folks who have smaller properties

1021
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:07,358
and would like to be involved in legal

1022
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,000
cultivation and getting a permit so

1023
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,480
there so there are dynamics that go that

1024
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,920
way as well so we're asking we ask

1025
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,280
people questions is an acre two large is

1026
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,240
it too small is it just right for a

1027
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,040
commercial grow and the answers that are

1028
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,318
coming back are are it's not consistent

1029
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:25,039
it's was like well 30% think it's too

1030
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:27,039
large 30% think it's too small and 30%

1031
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:29,358
think it's just right so we are

1032
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:33,159
threading the needle and we will be will

1033
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:34,960
be threading that needle I think that um

1034
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:36,920
so those are some of the implementation

1035
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,519
issues that we'll be dealing with oh

1036
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,920
there's another there's one one last one

1037
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:43,400
that I want to raise on this in this

1038
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:46,079
topic and that is that we have uh

1039
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,720
different sort of uh areas or sub

1040
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,318
regions within the county and everybody

1041
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,959
always feels like well my neighborhood's

1042
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:55,759
getting targeted for x or y whatever the

1043
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,358
thing that's going to be so we have uh

1044
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,839
we Yolo County our agricultural economy

1045
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:03,838
is very diverse we have large scale

1046
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:05,920
production agriculture with tens of

1047
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:08,358
thousands of acres under cultivation and

1048
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,200
very few people working and we have very

1049
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:14,159
small farms 20 100 acres where they're

1050
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:16,559
where they're very labor intensive in

1051
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,679
producing organic crops for farmers

1052
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:21,358
markets and so on there's no reason to

1053
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:23,480
think that that cannabis can't exist in

1054
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,799
that same with that same sort of

1055
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,719
analogous situation where you have small

1056
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,800
Growers

1057
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:31,399
larger Growers some are growing for

1058
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,720
different kinds of markets I think

1059
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,720
that's actually kind of exciting to me

1060
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:38,480
to think how that might all work out uh

1061
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:40,679
we but as we think about it and we think

1062
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,800
about how that lands in individual

1063
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:44,879
neighborhoods some of the folks are

1064
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,599
interested in making sure that that the

1065
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,200
cultivators are dispersed throughout the

1066
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,960
county that it's not all in one location

1067
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:54,358
others are talking about well maybe if

1068
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,679
it was if we had more cultivators in a

1069
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:58,358
certain location certain area then we

1070
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,719
could provide for greater Safety and

1071
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:02,358
Security for all

1072
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:03,919
concerned that's and I I said that was

1073
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:06,880
the last one but there is one more and

1074
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,800
that's the the vagueness of the

1075
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,720
interaction among the various legal

1076
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,920
Frameworks that we're dealing with you

1077
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:17,399
all know that more you know a lot better

1078
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,119
than I do but we for the first time with

1079
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,838
the Mera the state has given us a

1080
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:25,358
framework that we can work with we we

1081
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:28,440
were we were as lost local government

1082
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:30,519
was as as was as lost and stalemated as

1083
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,519
as the industry we couldn't figure out

1084
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:34,318
what to do if anything and so we

1085
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:37,440
basically all stayed out of it most of

1086
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:39,000
us did or a lot of us did anyway so now

1087
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,480
we've got a framework that we can make

1088
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,318
some sense of but there's still so much

1089
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,679
vagueness between what's at the federal

1090
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:47,960
level what's used to be the state law

1091
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,159
what will be the state framework so

1092
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,079
we're just trying to navigate to thread

1093
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,719
a needle on all this and make some sense

1094
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,400
of

1095
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:59,118
it you are trying to make sense of it

1096
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,280
and um you know the title of this panel

1097
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,200
is called cities counties and bands omai

1098
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,640
we're about to get to the omai part

1099
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,519
right now um just 12 days ago on

1100
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:12,039
September 14th at 7:00 a.m. in the

1101
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:14,400
morning a simultaneous raid occurred in

1102
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:16,159
yellow County as well as uh three of the

1103
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,639
homes of the Farmers on one of these

1104
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:21,519
licensed facilities um by an outof count

1105
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:24,039
taskforce called Tri County drug

1106
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,599
enforcement team or Trident which is an

1107
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:30,079
initiative of the Central Valley High

1108
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:32,079
intens drug trafficking area or hi haa

1109
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,519
um they came into Yolo County with a

1110
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:38,079
plaster County warrant um and kicked

1111
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:42,280
doors in and um and took down a half

1112
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:44,280
acre of a legally licensed farm so don

1113
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,680
can you tell us how you feel about an

1114
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,720
outer jurisdiction law enforcement

1115
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:50,440
agency coming in and taking down

1116
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,598
something that you permitted and gave

1117
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:56,760
your blessing

1118
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:58,599
for so I said that there were about 50 3

1119
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,200
Growers that are going through the

1120
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:02,640
permitting process about half of them

1121
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:04,639
are are in place and one in

1122
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,679
particular has a couple of them have

1123
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,639
been really shining stars they they look

1124
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:10,598
at us and they they look for guidance

1125
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,039
they want whatever we tell them this is

1126
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,599
how things will work they immediately

1127
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:17,079
comply uh they bring in they they set up

1128
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,519
the irrigation system set up the

1129
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:20,920
drainage they make sure that they're

1130
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:22,639
doing all the right things uh they apply

1131
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,920
for the state for the regional water

1132
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:27,039
quality control board permits they get

1133
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,720
all of it in place and then then

1134
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:31,599
something like this happens and this I

1135
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:33,358
know that many of you here in this room

1136
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,800
have heard this story or even had it

1137
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,759
happen to yourself or to somebody you

1138
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:42,160
know but it's pretty darn scary when you

1139
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,559
think of of U 7 in the morning your

1140
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:47,598
front the front door is broken in nobody

1141
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:49,160
says I'm you know this is a I'm a law

1142
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,920
enforcement official open your door

1143
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:54,960
please they break the door in uh they

1144
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,440
show up in unmarked vehicles and four

1145
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,880
different locations in three different

1146
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,760
counties uh with guns drawn where their

1147
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,559
little kids involved and they handcuff

1148
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,839
people and put zip ties on them and they

1149
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:07,599
throwing uh throwing people against

1150
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:09,519
walls and against and they're making

1151
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,519
them kneel on the ground and they're

1152
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:15,039
interrogating them without giving them

1153
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:17,920
mirander rights for hours out a time

1154
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,358
this is this is a a terrorist activity

1155
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,159
if you think about it if you just think

1156
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:22,159
about what's what's

1157
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,960
happening and

1158
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:29,558
and and the same and then the meaning of

1159
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,119
terrorism what this means is they're

1160
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:37,280
trying to in to instill fear they the

1161
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:39,400
the tactics deliberately instill fear

1162
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,720
and there and it comes at a time for us

1163
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:46,358
when we're we're walking to monitor our

1164
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:48,159
ordinance and we're working to develop

1165
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:51,039
tweaks things that we might want to

1166
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:56,318
change and we now have this added

1167
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:59,480
dimension of well what was the offense

1168
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:02,639
was there something that's being alleged

1169
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:05,838
that is illegal that we didn't know

1170
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:08,118
about or that and we're not hearing any

1171
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:11,519
specific charges even in fact none of

1172
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:14,640
the people involved in this incident

1173
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:18,480
have been charged with anything and yet

1174
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:21,358
1,800 plants that are that are designed

1175
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,719
and and connected to a collective for

1176
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:29,239
for medicinal purpose have been

1177
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:32,279
destroyed and the people involved are

1178
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:33,399
very shaken so psychologically shaken

1179
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,480
they thought they were doing all the

1180
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,559
right stuff they're deliberately working

1181
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,838
hard to make sure they do the right

1182
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,160
thing and then so we're we're still

1183
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:46,679
sorting this out and to have this be

1184
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:49,480
done from a this shadowy group that

1185
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:53,000
comes in unmarked cars with no license

1186
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:55,199
plate indication and and from another

1187
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,880
County from another County it's not even

1188
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,239
Yolo County we're not part of this three

1189
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,640
County it's El Dorado pler and

1190
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:04,719
Sacramento I mean led by led by pler

1191
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:07,879
County district attorney and his Strike

1192
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:09,558
Force but we we we are still struggling

1193
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,400
to figure out exactly what this was

1194
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:14,119
about and how it affects uh the people

1195
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,920
involved and I know that the people

1196
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:19,599
involved are are very stunned so I think

1197
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,000
of it as as an act of

1198
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:25,680
terrorism so don you just called this an

1199
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,559
act of terrorism um by Trident and I'm

1200
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,598
wondering uh do you believe that this

1201
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:32,200
will hinder your progress as your county

1202
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,680
is is making very big strides in

1203
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:36,759
crafting sensible regulations well I

1204
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:38,960
think that that it it sets it it's it

1205
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,920
sets up a whole series of questions that

1206
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,599
we we have been working to look at the

1207
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,200
whole cannabis World Through The Eyes of

1208
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:48,640
of Agriculture and how does this

1209
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:50,239
commodity work how do we how do we

1210
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,199
support it in the same ways that we've

1211
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,399
supported other agricultural Commodities

1212
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:56,439
how do we regulate it and so on we're

1213
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,720
looking at it and by the way we have not

1214
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:01,480
talked about revenues we haven't looked

1215
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:04,519
at at this from a taxation purpose we're

1216
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,519
charging fees that we think will will

1217
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:09,039
will absorb the cost and allow us to do

1218
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:11,280
some code enforcement for the the non

1219
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,519
for The shadowy Operators so that's

1220
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,880
that's what we're kind of looking at and

1221
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:18,119
it and it we've also been looking at

1222
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,798
more and more the medicinal value and

1223
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:23,680
I'm excited because I want to see us all

1224
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:25,358
look into the greater research

1225
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:28,239
possibilities and I want Yolo County to

1226
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:30,880
be a place where that is where that's a

1227
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,558
a center of that kind of activity but

1228
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,680
now we have a whole other series of

1229
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:37,960
questions that we know will be asked by

1230
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:40,118
by my by well by members of the Board of

1231
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,159
Supervisors well really was there

1232
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:44,000
something going on here is there

1233
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:46,679
something in the shadows that we need to

1234
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,719
shy away from so I think that to the

1235
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:52,879
degree that we allow that to that U that

1236
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:55,719
that fear to come from our community

1237
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,920
members or from our from the the

1238
00:49:55,719 --> 00:50:01,279
decision makers to the degree that we

1239
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:04,400
allow that to change our course then

1240
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,680
then the terror has succeeded so I think

1241
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,599
there is there is going to be some

1242
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:10,118
discussion about that and by the way I

1243
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,838
just I I did to say this is how I feel

1244
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:15,760
about it now there's we're assured that

1245
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:18,318
this investig this is an interesting

1246
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,559
comment here because we're assured that

1247
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,920
the investigation is still

1248
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,440
underway now that that means you know

1249
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,318
it's not over so there's something yet

1250
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,240
to happen there's some this great

1251
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:31,440
Spectre of maybe there's some illegal

1252
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:33,199
act that we don't know about yet so we

1253
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:37,000
can't I probably shouldn't even talk

1254
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:39,039
about it right we've seen the affid I've

1255
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,239
seen the the affidavit doesn't look like

1256
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:44,719
it's criminal what they're talking

1257
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:46,879
about but now we have this this Spectre

1258
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:47,838
as that's that's going to it's going

1259
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,000
certainly going to change the

1260
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:53,239
conversation to some degree I don't know

1261
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,159
how or when I got the call about this

1262
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:57,679
raid uh it was a farm that I had helped

1263
00:50:55,159 --> 00:51:00,519
consult Sultan and uh you know I I

1264
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:03,719
really have to say Yolo County uh

1265
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:06,039
Regulators Rose to the the occasion and

1266
