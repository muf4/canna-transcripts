1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
okay well i'm here with jill from golden

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,240
gardens farm and we're going to be

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,800
talking about her farm a bit and

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,280
checking out her flower so hi jill hello

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,759
how's it going good good glad to be here

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,838
today me too um so tell us a little bit

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,440
about your background with cannabis and

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,800
you know how you got started

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,640
well um

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,320
my husband has a degree in horticulture

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,160
and landscape design from michigan state

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,118
university and he started growing in

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,599
college

14
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:31,118
and we met in 2011 in san francisco

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,640
my background is in construction

16
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,238
management and together we realized we

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,480
wanted to get out of the rat race and

18
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,759
the corporate jobs that we were in

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,919
and we together had the experience to

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,599
start cultivating cannabis so we started

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
indoors in san francisco and the east

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,879
bay okay and had the opportunity to move

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,759
up to humboldt uh when legalization came

24
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,238
around

25
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,479
which was great

26
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,358
we were a bit more interested in

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,319
or we are excited about being outdoors

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,280
and

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,359
and gardening a plant

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,079
is awesome but we were walking into a

31
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:11,280
concrete building every day still under

32
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,359
fake lights with dehus and co2 emitters

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,478
and air conditioning

34
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,959
and so

35
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:20,239
we ourselves wanted to be

36
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:22,239
gardening outside in the garden and how

37
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,959
much more would the plants like that too

38
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,719
so we jumped on the opportunity to

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,798
come up here and have been here since

40
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,759
amazing that's awesome

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,880
um

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,280
why do you

43
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,199
like what draws you to farming like what

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,799
is it just the freedom of not being

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
attached to the corporate jobs because i

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,520
get that yeah but is there something

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840
else you like about it there's also

48
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,798
farming not only cannabis but having the

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,880
ability up here to grow our own food

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,560
um farm vegetables work with the soil

51
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,158
you're really a soil soil farmer if

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,960
you're a farmer or gardener yeah

53
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,799
but

54
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,319
working outside and in nature and with

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
nature

56
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,919
having hands in the soil touching the

57
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,159
plants being active and in it is

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
hard to explain but it's very

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
can be very stressful owning your own

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,439
business but it can all also be very

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,680
meditative

62
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,800
just putting on a podcast or music and

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,319
just

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,160
connecting with the plants and figuring

65
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,799
out what they need what they want yeah

66
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,759
for sure i hear it i know it

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,920
so um anything unique about your farm

68
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,959
like is it an interesting microclimates

69
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,518
challenges like what's um we're at about

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,840
1800 feet okay so

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,480
relatively high yeah we uh we're up

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,360
there we have a very small farm

73
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,878
and

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,239
my husband and i and we have one

75
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,679
employee out there

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,120
full time

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,920
which

78
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,759
allows us to be very hands-on we go

79
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,598
through and touch every plant multiple

80
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,399
times through its life

81
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,719
we have

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,840
we have beds but we have fabric side

83
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,400
beds

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,640
so we actually do three runs a year we

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,120
do a spring a summer and a fall run oh

86
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,719
yeah it's having the fabric beds allows

87
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,120
the beds to breathe when it's not

88
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,519
necessarily hot outside and then you can

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,640
still water yeah water consistently

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,158
better drying and it dries out exactly

91
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,719
yeah it makes sense yeah the springtime

92
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,878
i used to do some springtime runs too

93
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,439
like march april yep and they're very

94
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:22,158
challenging yeah uh temperature and

95
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,959
moisture levels yeah when the in april

96
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,039
when it's in the daylight is about 12 12

97
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,400
that's when we start our first run

98
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,000
typically yeah

99
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,680
most some cultivars do better than

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,878
others in the spring we have found for

101
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,480
sure some are a bit more robust and

102
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:40,158
tend to

103
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:42,719
not necessarily notice the cold at the

104
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,120
beginning of their life and then by the

105
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,479
time that they're harvested in june

106
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,239
it's warm and dry outside yeah

107
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,919
do you feel like i mean intuitively when

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,280
i just when you say that i think about

109
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,639
like more you know

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,239
for lack of a better word indica

111
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,919
dominant or broad leaf you know like

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,719
afghan

113
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,479
varieties that are just used to the cold

114
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,479
i don't do you feel like that's true or

115
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,399
not um

116
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,079
i haven't noticed that in particular we

117
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,239
don't go through a lot of varieties

118
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,599
because of our size we can't have many

119
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,560
cultivars or we don't have enough

120
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,560
material of each

121
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,600
yeah that's so that's a unique challenge

122
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,279
for you guys that's true that is a

123
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,120
unique challenge and just keeping up

124
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,959
with the industry right now we still

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,240
have to grow something high t and

126
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,399
high in thc to have it move yeah so your

127
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,519
options are kind of limited what we have

128
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,519
found the best um is the longer the

129
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,639
flower cycle the better it does in the

130
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,399
spring

131
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,720
probably because it has more of its life

132
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,079
time oh sure like the later stage oh

133
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,400
that's interesting yeah no that makes

134
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,918
sense it's like the later by the time

135
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,959
it's flowering a week five six seven

136
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,799
eight right nine it's you know the

137
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,638
development of those flowers can

138
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,639
rapidly expand and if it's already

139
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,560
warmer out then that's the right time

140
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,319
for that exactly that's interesting the

141
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,759
shorter strain in the spring is not good

142
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,079
although we do pick a shorter weak

143
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,840
strain for our fall run yeah six to

144
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,519
seven weeks strain because now it's

145
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,239
finishing when it's getting cold and the

146
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,319
lights decreasing outside more and more

147
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,360
do you feel like there's any other man

148
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,478
like do you have any interesting

149
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,680
management practices just regarding um

150
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,839
you know

151
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,560
methodologies you use like entire in

152
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,599
terms of inputs or um

153
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,600
we get our anything say it again been

154
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,439
working on any

155
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
my husband has the horticulture major so

156
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,879
he kind of he understands the science of

157
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
it and that's where i've learned most of

158
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:34,478
the science of cultivation

159
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,160
um we do get our soil tested and have

160
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:40,159
amendments made to the soil cool um and

161
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,840
we fight a lot you know

162
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,000
as a farmer like i said before you're a

163
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,119
soil farmer so we it all starts in the

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
soil we

165
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,639
fight a lot of uh

166
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,160
molds mildews bugs a lot of that stuff

167
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,918
can be fought if you treat your soil

168
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,880
correctly and they don't have a place to

169
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:58,318
to breed and develop

170
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,079

181
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,440
apple fruit is a good one it grows on

oh it smells good yeah

184
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,159
we used to grow sherbert and those sweet

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,720
strains and this

186
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,400
yeah grows very similar to that oh it's

187
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,639
just sticky to the touch like it's

188
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,120
already like tacky yeah like sticky

189
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
sticky this one came out of our fall run

190
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,160
actually so we harvested it oh man it's

191
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,519
all it's got some nice purple hues to it

192
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,120

193
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,120
oh wow

194
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,038
it almost smells like my wife's making

195
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,319
like green apples into a pie or

196
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,399

197
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,800

cake that one i know

205
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,519
that's a shorter

206
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,598
life cycle so it does does good for us

207
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,680
in the fall and the

208
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,439
cold at the end of the

209
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,000
flower's life

210
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,079
yeah wow makes colors come out

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,319
it's got that pineapple smell

212
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,159
oh it's so loud the terps are so loud

213
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,400
yeah that one is did they ever do any

214
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,319
pro concentrate processing with this one

215
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,918
do you guys just sell flowers we just

216
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,000
sell flowers so i'm not sure

217
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,000
wow right now yeah that's amazing right

218
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,839
you never know yeah

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,519
there's another year ahead

220
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,119
wow and then um

221
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,878
do you guys sell locally or do you have

222
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,959
products around the state

223
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,319
um right now we wholesale

224
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,478
one of the questions we've been asking

225
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,520
everyone if you could change one thing

226
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,399
in the industry whether it's like

227
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:01,918
through education or regulation

228
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,758
what would that what would that be

229
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,159
um

230
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,479
i think

231
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,960
the biggest thing for me right now would

232
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,038
probably be consumer education

233
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,638
and understanding

234
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,199
i mean i don't think any of us really

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,759
understand what this plant fully can do

236
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,319
but just to understand uh right now it's

237
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,080
so much about thc yeah and and

238
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,080
personally coming from indoor now moving

239
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,279
to outdoor you see how much more the

240
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,279
terpene profile

241
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,559
gives the plant its full full potential

242
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,639
full expression and how much more

243
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,958
important that can be yeah and how you

244
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:41,360
can have a very low thc plant that has

245
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,759
the terpene profile that speaks to what

246
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,759
your you need or what you're feeling and

247
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,759
it can be the best strain you've ever

248
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,278
and and even minor cannabinoids like

249
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,039
other minor for sure

250
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,480
yeah exactly

251
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,319
i agree i think there's a lot of

252
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,720
research that's that's going into that i

253
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,760
think there's a podcast uh kiss organics

254
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
i don't know if you know this guy you

255
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,480
know

256
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,680
yeah he a while back had an episode i

257
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,000
wish i could remember which one it was

258
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,359
but it was a scientist lady and i think

259
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,360
they were out in colorado i'm probably

260
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
wrong but basically the study was they

261
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,480
did a blind study

262
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,360
where people smoked weed and they were

263
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,278
doing high th seaweed and basically you

264
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,560
know 15 like a 30 thc versus a 15

265
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,559
with minor cannabinoids and higher

266
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,759
terpene levels and they showed that

267
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,838
consistently people chose the lower thc

268
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,838
weeks it just made them feel better

269
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,920
right is better body high absolutely

270
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,399
just in general well-being better

271
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,838
feeling of well-being overall right so i

272
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,440
think we got a lot of ways to go with

273
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,279
that but hopefully we can get there and

274
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,519
education's key we should talk more

275
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,759
about it because yeah it's interesting

276
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,560
for sure i think a big way to do that is

277
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,639
what many people have say is uh farmer

278
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,479
to consumer sales

279
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,519
because if you think about the vegetable

280
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,519
industry

281
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,278
and how you go to farmers markets and

282
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,560
you can talk to the person that grew

283
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,679
what you're buying and you're about to

284
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,239
consume

285
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,639
you know if if we could have um cannabis

286
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,159
farmers markets that's the best way to

287
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,919
maybe not the best bit it's a great way

288
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,078
to educate the customer

289
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,319
and they can now talk to the farmer the

290
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:13,278
gardener who grew it that's a great goal

291
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,399
to strive for yeah absolutely um let me

292
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,159
think there's one more thing i don't

293
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,600
know if you want to talk about it but

294
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,519
do you have anything that makes you'd

295
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,120
like to you know single out your product

296
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,480
against like a corporate model like what

297
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,759
what do you think makes your product

298
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,360
better than you know just like

299
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,399
mass-produced weed

300
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,639
um

301
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,278
i would think the biggest thing is the

302
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,360
love and care we put out there it's me

303
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,679
and my husband we're in our front yard

304
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,919
we have one worker and we're all out

305
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,078
there across from each other looking at

306
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,879
the plants caring about what the plants

307
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:42,958
need

308
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,039
individual needs yeah i'll go out there

309
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,958
to our employee and i'll be like i may

310
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,278
be the owner but these ladies are the

311
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,399
boss what they need goes

312
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,399

313
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,159
schedule we cater to that absolutely and

314
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,759
