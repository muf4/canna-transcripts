1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,839
what traits do you look for specifically

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:10,859
in male plants if you're seeking a good

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:15,990
breeder well I'm a big fan of the stem

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:19,948
rub and I really love Turpin's and the

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:25,039
all the different possibilities that

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:30,090
there are in the cannabis species so

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:34,469
that's something that has done me served

8
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:39,390
me well for ever and I'll probably never

9
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:43,020
put down that tool you know no matter

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:47,759
what and then you know we did some some

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:52,649
testing of males this year that's kind

12
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:54,780
of a cool trick but yeah and then I you

13
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,299
know certainly structure and if you're

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,549
trying to breed for homozygosity your

15
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:02,968
uniformity then you want to look for one

16
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,890
that has a similar structure to you know

17
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,780
if you're trying to make an inbred line

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,280
for example or something like that so

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,618
gene you want to do some of that yeah

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,519
that's actually just touching the plant

21
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:20,969
and and and seeing really what the

22
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:25,649
smells you get from the stem different

23
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:27,420
ones are different so like og and

24
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,250
everybody's nose works different but

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,219
like me I can pick an OG male hella easy

26
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,950
cuz it smells like dill pickles to me

27
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:36,359
and if it smells like dill pickles that

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,850
one has it and it doesn't mean that

29
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,819
it'll necessarily carry it depending on

30
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:43,769
what you're pulling it from so if you

31
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,889
already have seeds where you know that

32
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:49,349
all the females do smell like OG and

33
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,019
then you've get a male out of there that

34
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:54,509
you know like if I was gonna be breeding

35
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,759
something with OG for example I'd be

36
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,500
like okay what does it need improvement

37
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,269
on so you want a little bit of an

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,540
improved structure so it's a little more

39
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:06,449
sturdy you want improved resistance to

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,340
powdery mildew so if I was breeding oh

41
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,560
geez I'd probably want to like stick

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,469
them in a room and get them really humid

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,729
for a little while maybe let them droop

44
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:15,949
couple times before they're really

45
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:18,319
flower and heavy so that I can kind of

46
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:20,899
trigger their stress response so that

47
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,879
they'll get attacked on purpose so you

48
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,800
can kind of go okay there's the one that

49
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,919
that that's resistant because otherwise

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,070
if you treat to treat them you know if

51
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,659
they have perfect conditions and you're

52
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,909
breeding for something that's triggered

53
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:38,000
by bad conditions you're not gonna see

54
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:40,069
it so it doesn't you there's no way to

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,889
select for that so you have to kind of

56
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:44,060
put pressures on things to see different

57
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,500
things like if you want to know if a

58
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,120
brand if the branches are strong you're

59
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,550
gonna have to snap them you'd have to be

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,490
like alright weak weak branches you

61
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:56,090
break some you know and then like some

62
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,770
some plants grow with like actually

63
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,180
almost sometimes it'll almost look like

64
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:04,969
a bubble at the at the junction of the

65
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,890
branch and the main stalk so it'll

66
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:09,469
actually be like there's these ones

67
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:12,439
where they'll never break right at the

68
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:14,569
junction they'll actually Bend and kind

69
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,489
of break over right up from it a little

70
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:19,519
bit and those ones tend to be a lot more

71
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:21,650
sturdy and they I found those in in most

72
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,860
stuff so it's like you know little

73
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,500
things like that are cool to look for

74
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:32,690
but you know yeah the stem rub is

75
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,550
basically if you I really like to if I

76
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:36,919
can grow something if I have enough

77
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,989
seeds if I don't have enough I'll grow

78
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,280
them and I'll just use all the males and

79
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:41,659
all the females and do an open

80
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,519
pollination so I know I have a bunch

81
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:46,159
more and then out of my favorite females

82
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,780
then I'll try some of those and when I

83
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,569
do the firt when I grow them out the

84
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,580
first time I'll try to figure out which

85
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:55,819
plants you have to observe a lot so you

86
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:59,269
look okay these plants I can notice

87
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:03,229
these things about them and then when

88
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:07,180
they finish as female plants then you

89
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:10,609
kind of see trends so you go okay well

90
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,980
every female that looked like this or

91
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,620
that had this stem rub they wound up

92
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:17,689
being like this and then you can get a

93
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,538
correlation there and then you know okay

94
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:22,189
so like if you're if you're looking for

95
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:25,038
a good OG male and you go this one

96
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:26,269
smells like OG it's like it turns out no

97
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:27,949
the really good OG

98
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:30,079
to me that I have they smell like

99
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:31,759
pickles so I want the male that smells

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,348
like pickles if it smells like OG when

101
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,360
it's done it might not smell like OG

102
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:37,370
already smells like OG on the stem so

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,280
that it's it's kind of like learning the

104
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,259
plants and I like to learn them before I

105
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,929
try to really do any selective breeding

106
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:46,639
and that makes it easier and that's the

107
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,410
thing about looking for male traits is

108
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,900
there's overall ones you don't want one

109
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,180
that's a pest magnet you don't want one

110
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:55,310
that's a fungus magnet you don't want

111
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,009
one that has really weak snappy

112
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,079
structure you know if maybe if they're

113
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:02,389
super hard to clone or they have really

114
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,969
weak roots there's some basic things

115
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:07,340
that you can look for just overall and

116
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,500
go it's not the best plant for these

117
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,179
reasons but a lot of times with

118
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,800
selecting males you actually want to

119
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,069
find the one that carries what you like

120
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,300
about the females so that takes

121
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:21,319
observation and figuring out where it is

122
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:26,000
and different different genes basically

123
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:27,889
travel in groups inbreeding to where you

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,509
might try to get rid of something and

125
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,129
discover that every time you get rid of

126
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:33,979
that you get rid of the other thing you

127
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:36,800
wanted so maybe you go oh I always want

128
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:38,418
maybe somebody's already May s already

129
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,449
bred something that you're starting with

130
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:43,968
where you go mmm the one that I like to

131
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:46,218
smoke I can grow as many as I want and

132
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:48,348
the ones I really like they always have

133
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:50,060
kind of flimsy branches so you might be

134
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,908
stuck with that unless you want to make

135
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,728
a new hybrid and then incorporate

136
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:58,098
strength and in your new hybrid you can

137
00:05:55,728 --> 00:06:00,439
get new stuff happening you know but

138
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:03,408
it's really for for male selecting to me

139
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,658
is really looking at finding which male

140
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:08,870
is the one that really does what I want

141
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:11,319
in that type and then using those kind

142
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:16,069
of males so it really takes like

143
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:17,780
studying the way that is and then you

144
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:19,580
can pick them and then of course use

145
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:21,859
your you know use your general things

146
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,689
where you go okay anything crappy we

147
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,819
don't want to use that but have the ones

148
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:27,740
that we like you know you then you want

149
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,240
to figure out what's like the actual

150
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,860
it's almost like seeing a face and

151
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,139
recognized in the face or recognized in

152
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,400
a voice you're like there's that plant I

153
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,530
know that plan it always does this you

154
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,109
find those correlations and those groups

155
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,698
of traits that all travel together like

156
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,100
I someone was asking me about the piñas

157
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:47,910
that I sold this year their purple stem

158
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,650
and they're all purple stem and they all

159
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,530
have the same smell and the trip was

160
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:55,709
that the purple stem travels with this

161
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:57,899
particular group of terpenes so that

162
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:59,549
it's really easy to breed it to have the

163
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,529
smell if you just look for the ones with

164
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,150
a purple stems and then you smell the

165
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:05,309
stalk there might be a couple of them

166
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:07,349
that are a little off you go no but this

167
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,030
one has the most of that smell and it's

168
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,240
purple stem you put them together and

169
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:16,500
really fast I was able to go okay this

170
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,660
is that so if that wasn't that those

171
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,550
that male might have been the sturdiest

172
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,500
and the stinkiest and the fastest

173
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,780
growing but if you hate that smell don't

174
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,069
pick the purple stem one you got to get

175
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,859
a different one so you got to learn the

176
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:33,180
plants and then when you select your

177
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:36,449
males then you can you can have you know

178
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,720
success a lot easier you can also just

179
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:43,348
go I really like this plant and use that

180
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,699
male because you're likely to get plants

181
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:46,139
that look like it and that might have

182
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,110
been what you like you're like wow this

183
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,668
thing has a luster and a vigor to it and

184
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,500
it's like well you're at least gonna get

185
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:54,240
that and then you can find out later if

186
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,038
you get those other traits that are

187
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,990
important to you too you can always try

188
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,870
it you always throw it and see if it

189
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,329
sticks but you wanna you wanna ideally

190
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,340
learn what you're working with first and

191
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:07,800
then like I was talking about the the

192
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:10,739
weird the weirdos in the cherry limeade

193
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,990
like if you didn't mind having really

194
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,668
little weird plants you might be able to

195
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,560
make really cool stuff with that cuz the

196
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:18,149
weeds always kill her the plants not

197
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,430
that good though so what I did is I

198
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:23,329
looked and looked till I got males that

199
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,769
had the same smell and the same resinous

200
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:28,620
leaves and everything and then I went

201
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:31,198
okay so this is like that it's more rare

202
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,360
in this form but this has the traits I

203
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,729
like in that but this thing grows and it

204
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,399
doesn't have weird a weird look to it

205
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,020
that freaks people out so then you know

206
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,848
that you wind up going with that but

207
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,620
that's how I select males personally is

208
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,050
by learning what it is like you're like

209
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,909
okay what if you were breeding dogs you

210
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:49,019
know you'd be like okay you're not gonna

211
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:50,879
breed Rottweilers

212
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,949
I liked this one it didn't have

213
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,330
Rottweiler markings but it's good

214
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,950
Rottweiler and then after a while people

215
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,930
be like this ain't a Rottweiler dude you

216
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,720
didn't pick the right one that was a

217
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:02,278
sport it was different and it wasn't the

218
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,990
right thing to use so you want to learn

219
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:05,700
you want to know what a Rottweiler looks

220
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,320
like you want to know how tall the

221
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,629
shoulder how tall is the hips

222
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,540
what's the sway in the back how long is

223
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:14,639
the tail on a puppy how do the ears lay

224
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:17,219
what are their where do their teeth sit

225
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,289
howard what what are the what's the line

226
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,570
in the front all that stuff to learn to

227
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,919
go okay now I'm breeding dogs so if you

228
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,510
really want to breed stuff you really

229
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:26,429
have to know the description of what

230
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:29,338
you're shooting for and that's how you

231
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:31,109
pick the males but that's not to say you

232
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,870
might you might have had a killer dog

233
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,269
that was like a Rottweiler that was all

234
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,950
black or all tan and you're like I like

235
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:39,539
that one nothing wrong with that you're

236
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,910
just gonna be going a new place and you

237
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:44,039
have to have focus for doing that so you

238
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:44,850
can just randomly select a male because

239
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,088
you like it

240
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,399
but it's gonna be more difficult to lock

241
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:53,459
down the exact things you want so you

242
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,700
want to learn your genetics to pick them

243
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,699
you know
