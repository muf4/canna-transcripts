2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,880
spencer HR was a pretty non-existent

3
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,560
before the legal market came in i think

4
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,778
that when i came in that was one of the

5
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,429
biggest shocks for me coming into the

6
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:37,320
cannabis industry i'm coming from other

7
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:39,659
industries at the state not only of how

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,890
employees were being paid and treated in

9
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,319
the amount of hours they were working

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,140
but also just organizational structure

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,609
complete lack of job descriptions and

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,259
other things that are really important

13
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:53,850
for for organizations to work so since

14
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,140
the legal market has come in i think

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,359
that there's a lot of people making

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,850
strides to make cannabis business look

17
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,049
like other businesses but there is

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,840
definitely still plenty of room for

19
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:06,780
improvement i came from other industries

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,609
where HR was the corner like a corner

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,879
cent of how your business practices and

22
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:13,500
when I got into into cannabis it was

23
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,368
just a completely different world nobody

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,989
ran nobody had handbooks nobody you know

25
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,569
talked about big vacation I mean that

26
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:23,489
was way off the radar so getting into

27
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,809
this now we are making a lot of these

28
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:29,459
changes then Cassie and I have worked

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,799
and tandem in making are making sure

30
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,989
that our employees are taken care of and

31
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,560
we fight for livable wages and we fight

32
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:38,429
for paid time off so that we can you

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,439
need to move forward

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,439
the first thing with all the different

35
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,758
companies that I've worked with is to go

36
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,469
through and figure out what their

37
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,118
organizational structures and write it

38
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:51,179
down you know because there were people

39
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,310
acting in a managerial capacity they

40
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,409
just weren't necessarily compensated

41
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,030
with something like an exempt salary

42
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,149
which is something that you should have

43
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,359
when you're in charge of hiring firing

44
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,218
all these other managerial aspects so

45
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,560
once you kind of go through the company

46
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:09,179
and actually figure out what everybody

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,580
is doing what roles they are playing

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,979
then you can just apply rules from other

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,569
industries it's

50
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:16,759
California labor laws are pretty easy to

51
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:18,348
find uh-huh so once you take a peek at

52
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,389
that and figure out what the exempt

53
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:22,158
salary is supposed to be what minimum

54
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:23,268
wage is all these different things you

55
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:25,519
can just go ahead and plug that right

56
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:28,310
into your organizational structure so an

57
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,530
exempt employee is pretty much defined

58
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,110
as someone who's making at least twice

59
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:36,140
the minimum wage and this makes them

60
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,319
exempt from some things like overtime or

61
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:41,328
the you have to hit that break within

62
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:42,798
like the first five hours or things like

63
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:46,280
that some things that hourly employees

64
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:48,530
are subject to and the reason for that

65
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,719
is that exempt employees usually play a

66
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,959
different role where it's not as

67
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,489
structured so they sometimes have to do

68
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,590
work those longer days because that's

69
00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:00,079
needed but their salary is in a place

70
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:05,539
where that's the agreement that they've

71
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:07,700
come to I'm trying to think like legally

72
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:11,209
the differences you you want to try not

73
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:13,068
to exempt too many employees the idea is

74
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:16,039
that they should really be people who

75
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:18,619
are superlatively invested in the

76
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:21,379
project so your management staff if

77
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,049
they're if they are responsible for

78
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,969
overseeing other people they're likely

79
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:27,379
going to fall into this category because

80
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:28,818
this is someone you know who's gonna get

81
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:31,579
a phone call when they're off site

82
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:33,500
because an incident happened so in this

83
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:34,790
way that person's not necessarily

84
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,340
clocking in and clocking out for each

85
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:39,949
hour of work it's a little bit more of

86
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,709
an agreed-upon salary now you can have

87
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:46,638
agreed upon salaries that come in under

88
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:49,219
that exempt wage right so you could pay

89
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,750
somebody a salary of $30,000 if you

90
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:52,789
wanted and they're getting that they

91
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,348
just get a specific each week not

92
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:57,168
necessarily based on their clock and

93
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:59,659
clock out but that person is not exempt

94
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:00,769
so you do owe them overtime so just

95
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,049
because you're paying someone a salary

96
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:05,299
doesn't mean you don't owe them ot it

97
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,560
has to get they have to be making a

98
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,510
certain amount of money which right now

99
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,039
for the state of California and it

100
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:12,229
changes based on how many employees you

101
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:24,408
have but that is at least twice the

102
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:25,909
minimum wage so we have 26 employees at

103
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:32,209
Green Cross and we

104
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:33,880
have four exempt employees the way that

105
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:36,459
I try to think about it for exempt is

106
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:39,409
employees who are gonna have to make

107
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:41,779
distance decisions you know without me

108
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,880
needing to give direction to that they

109
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:46,939
are on call that they are assisting on

110
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:50,060
projects with very little direction and

111
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:51,740
guidance at times and that would be you

112
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,350
know sometimes your inventory manager

113
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,970
your shells manager can oftentimes fall

114
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,010
under that or they may not fall

115
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,900
underneath that so our two stores have

116
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:02,990
very different components we are a much

117
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:05,209
smaller team of about ten people and and

118
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,519
so majority of all of our staff is

119
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:09,739
pretty much so is not exempt because I

120
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,329
make all the decisions pretty much up

121
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,340
for this door what are some of the

122
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:19,609
things we think the very first and

123
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:22,099
foremost is over time if that person

124
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,500
works more than 40 hours in a week or

125
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,320
more than eight hours in a day you owe

126
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,500
them more compensation things go up

127
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,209
after ten and twelve hours as well so if

128
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,920
you're expecting so much work 12 hour

129
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:37,279
days they're gonna be working for almost

130
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,439
double their hourly rate so checking in

131
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,689
on those points is is really important

132
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,040
because sometimes in retail you do get

133
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,509
things where people are working a double

134
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,450
shift you know because somebody called

135
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:49,159
out sick but as an as a manager you have

136
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:51,889
to be sure that that person has been

137
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,230
paid for staying that extra amount of

138
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,810
time so overtime I think is kind of the

139
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,090
first big one that people are concerned

140
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:02,870
with but you also have to be concerned

141
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:04,279
with things like taking breaks so if

142
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,829
somebody's working an eight-hour day

143
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:09,349
they are due to 10-minute breaks in one

144
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:11,418
30-minute break you know a lunch

145
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,520
something like that so and they have to

146
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:16,490
be taken within the first five hours of

147
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,349
their shift at least their first one so

148
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,540
that's another thing you know people

149
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,640
aren't always concerned about so for me

150
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,410
you know we really do try and work to

151
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,909
get our employees as autonomous as

152
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,110
possible so they come in in the very

153
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,910
beginning of the day and they sign up

154
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,129
for breaks so that they know what time

155
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,720
they're going to go I can double check

156
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:34,939
to make sure that that's all well within

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,320
reason and then the manager really only

158
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,689
has to check and make sure people are

159
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,139
taking them instead of calculating kind

160
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,930
of

161
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:43,460
they have what they're do but those are

162
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,709
I think the biggest red flags that I've

163
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:47,930
noticed that people weren't really aware

164
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:49,549
of as non-exempt employees that that

165
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,430
they were do these breaks and they were

166
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,499
do this overtime pay and I think going

167
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,180
to that is that you know all these

168
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:58,610
different areas where software can

169
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:02,139
assist us on this you know we utilize a

170
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:06,560
system called home base that manages our

171
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:08,478
our payroll and it has been amazing

172
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,620
because it'll alert you if you need to

173
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,228
take a break it'll send you a text

174
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,418
message it'll let the the person on duty

175
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:15,709
know that if somebody's late and it's a

176
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:18,799
great way for us to be able to manage

177
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,778
those things and catch issues before

178
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,270
they are an issue so say for instance we

179
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:26,209
have an employee who missed a lunch or a

180
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:28,370
break that day it's it's easier for us

181
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:30,709
to catch it in that situation so

182
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,019
actually that's a good example somebody

183
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:35,568
misses a lunch break for whatever reason

184
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:38,389
you have protocols in place where they

185
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:40,669
sign a form stating that I acknowledge

186
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,939
that I did not take a lunch break today

187
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:45,318
or we accept we expected somewhere in

188
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,870
writing whether it's through our digital

189
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:50,539
communication platform of slack or that

190
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,610
home base somewhere that they have said

191
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:55,278
that they're okay with not taking that

192
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,229
break because that is as a manager you

193
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:58,459
only have to offer it or as a company

194
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,528
you have to make sure that they're

195
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:03,318
allowed to take it if they want to it's

196
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:05,088
their prerogative to skip if they'd like

197
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,810
now with breaks for example if their

198
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:10,519
unpaid weekend or paid unpaid we can

199
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,709
make them mandatory for people they

200
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:14,209
don't have a choice there but for us

201
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:15,978
people do have choices about their

202
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:17,628
10-minute breaks but yeah if they don't

203
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:19,459
want to take them we do ask that we get

204
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:20,990
something there in writing so that if

205
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,788
say an auditor were to come through and

206
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,598
say well this person never takes a

207
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:25,848
10-minute break

208
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,128
so we do need to have a release form

209
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:31,788
signed when somebody does miss a break

210
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:33,500
however I do not allow my staff to miss

211
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:35,658
breaks and there's a big reason to that

212
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,820
if you're not taking breaks your

213
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:40,069
productivity light goes down

214
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,829
significantly so I try to make sure that

215
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,480
my staff gets their regular breaks and

216
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:46,250
like we have two very different size

217
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,220
teams and we reach a different

218
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:52,068
demographic completely but I make sure

219
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,850
that my staff is taking those if it's an

220
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:54,889
issue where we know

221
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,199
somebody's like habitually missing

222
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:58,850
things then we have a discussion about

223
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:00,859
do we need to have more people on the

224
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,449
sales floor do you need more support if

225
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,680
you're having to miss breaks if you feel

226
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:06,109
like you're having to miss breaks

227
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,239
because I don't like to micromanage my

228
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,278
team's is you don't either it's we want

229
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,740
to make sure that they our managers are

230
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:13,850
you know taking the initiative to make

231
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,839
sure that people are taking their breaks

232
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,230
and that they're taking a break

233
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:21,740
themselves managing difficult employees

234
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:28,250
is the reality of any industry and we're

235
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:30,409
not exempt from that but we do we work a

236
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,149
lot with progressive disciplinary policy

237
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:34,278
where we basically set out in our

238
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:36,948
handbook that these are our expectations

239
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:38,389
and if you don't follow these rules

240
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:41,028
these are the kind of warnings that

241
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:43,100
you'll get and so we do it's pretty

242
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:45,470
basic a verbal warning is kind of first

243
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,079
which we do document with a signature

244
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,240
and then written warning comes next and

245
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:52,338
in some cases suspension is appropriate

246
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,620
after that but a lot of times after

247
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:58,250
those multiple written warnings it

248
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,649
progresses on to I kind of joke that I'm

249
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,049
the I'm the queen of uncomfortable

250
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:05,059
conversations and I don't have a problem

251
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:09,649
having conversations with people about

252
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:11,838
how they need to just step it up and I

253
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:13,759
try to do it in a way that is very

254
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,110
constructive where I can discuss with

255
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,539
them about a positive thing that they're

256
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:21,019
doing and then to move forward with that

257
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:23,870
however this is an industry where when I

258
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:25,399
came on to the store and and Cassie came

259
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,839
soon after that because she was a

260
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,389
formerly the assistant director and I

261
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,069
was over both stores we've had a clean

262
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:35,299
house and every time I've ever come on

263
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:37,370
to a business of that clinic and retail

264
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:39,828
stores and here in cannabis is it's

265
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:43,339
pretty much so always cleaning house if

266
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:45,229
your staff is not appropriate for what

267
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:47,569
your goal is then you're going to have

268
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:50,240
significant issues so letting go staff

269
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:53,000
is a difficult thing this is an industry

270
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,039
though that has never really met HR

271
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,629
needs and they haven't supplied them

272
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,610
with a termination paper or a

273
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:00,110
termination form so that is something

274
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,659
that you know we have gotten into the

275
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,009
habit of whenever we have a conversation

276
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:05,240
of any type and I think it's almost

277
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:06,009
ridiculous when you have a verbal

278
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,629
warning but

279
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:09,189
you have to document it so they're like

280
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:10,419
is this a written warning and what

281
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,980
catches a lot of people off-guard and

282
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,569
it's like this is just a way for us to

283
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,690
document that we've had a discussion

284
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,360
about this it's not a written warning so

285
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:22,510
you're giving them the verbal warning

286
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,519
then you're sending them like email no

287
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:27,069
so I actually have a form we have a form

288
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,389
that we document what the verbal warning

289
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,010
was about and it's classified as a

290
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,980
verbal warning which is not to the same

291
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:34,419
extent as a written warning and so we

292
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,590
just discussed it so that we and they

293
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:39,759
have to sign off on the verbal warning

294
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,950
that it has been documented in their

295
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,629
file so that meaning they sign the paper

296
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,090
yes they have to sign the paper they

297
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:47,439
have a copy of it themselves and it

298
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,629
seems like I remember the first time

299
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,390
that I had the situation where I had to

300
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:54,399
do this and the employee was completely

301
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:55,720
taken off guard like well this is a

302
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,129
written warning like I promise you this

303
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,960
isn't a written warning this is a verbal

304
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:01,059
warning we just have to document it and

305
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,070
think that that's a big thing is is a

306
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:05,559
lot of stores in the past have paid cash

307
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:09,430
every day for employees they didn't pay

308
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:11,859
not even appropriate $2.99 nor did they

309
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:15,279
have them on payroll and we've also

310
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,019
noticed that this is a situation is that

311
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,990
a lot of times that the employees that

312
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:22,539
are cashed daily are not the same

313
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,669
employees that we need for our store to

314
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:27,789
move forward and you know when we switch

315
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:29,709
to twice monthly payroll we notice that

316
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,809
we lose people on that and a large

317
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,250
portion of that is people that are

318
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:35,139
eligible in this industry are used to

319
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,279
being paid daily and we're trying to

320
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,019
professionalize the way we're doing

321
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,169
things and make sure that we're meeting

322
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:44,470
all not just meeting state expectations

323
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:46,389
but exceeding our own expectations so

324
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,870
just to clarify you're saying that when

325
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:51,399
you transition from daily payroll to

326
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,620
bimonthly there were people who are put

327
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,850
off by it understandably because they

328
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,320
would have to have to wait technically

329
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,960
three weeks before they get a paycheck

330
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,180
and I think that the smoother transition

331
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:05,290
with that is switching from daily to

332
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:08,709
weekly payroll and then from weekly to

333
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:10,480
buy you know every two weeks and that

334
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,280
helps with it but however every time we

335
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,730
do that and I've done that with other

336
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:18,250
companies as well people drop off we've

337
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,690
always been really lucky that I always

338
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,720
really trusted the person

339
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:25,090
always processed our payroll so that's

340
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,830
been very nice to actually have that

341
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:29,320
process through a professional company

342
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:32,889
that pays all the taxes correctly in all

343
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,390
of that good stuff I think that's why so

344
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,159
many companies just did it cash at the

345
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:37,899
end of the day cuz you know you say okay

346
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,129
I'm gonna pay you X amount per hour and

347
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:40,840
at the end of the day we could just say

348
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:43,240
how many hours are you care tires and

349
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,700
here you go here's your payout versus

350
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,509
all of the taxes and fees and everything

351
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,100
that go into paying payroll a correct

352
00:13:49,509 --> 00:14:04,090
way that way you're paying back to the

353
00:13:51,100 --> 00:14:06,340
state things like that so we do we do

354
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,019
have a system where we take credit cards

355
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,050
and debit cards through the system links

356
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:12,250
which is a qualified system here in the

357
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:15,729
state of California for us to utilize

358
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:19,029
with cannabis it is a processing system

359
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,490
solely meant for cannabis and we've used

360
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:25,889
it for about a year now and absolutely

361
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:29,310
love it it's a great system for us so

362
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:31,840
customers come in and pay by credit card

363
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:33,519
so they have to buy a gift card with

364
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,980
their credit card and then that gift

365
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,929
card allows them to buy cannabis and

366
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,430
what this really skirts and the reason

367
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:41,739
that I brought it up is that cannabis

368
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:43,059
has a lot of issues with accounting you

369
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,830
know we get all this cash throughout the

370
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:46,149
day in most retail locations get a bunch

371
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,520
of cash then they drop it off at the

372
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:51,009
bank however we're more flagged for that

373
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,639
than most retail operations because of

374
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:56,529
the federal illegality still of cannabis

375
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,889
so a lot of banks don't want to take the

376
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,600
risk to work with cannabis businesses so

377
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:04,088
we wind up instead of having a nice

378
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,540
fluffy bank account we have you know a

379
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:09,540
ton of cash on hand which makes security

380
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:12,069
risks and all these other things so

381
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,649
things like links have kind of been

382
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,589
assuring the cannabis industry in to

383
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:19,569
these to these financial systems that

384
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,820
are helping us to do our accounting a

385
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,100
little bit easier local credit unions

386
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,680
have also been super helpful as ways to

387
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,980
help people in cannabis actually

388
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:32,259
protects their money and that's really

389
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,930
getting an account was the trickiest

390
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:34,458
piece

391
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:36,708
once you have an account then it's easy

392
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,838
to pay your payroll and things like that

393
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:41,149
submit it just like any other company

394
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,559
would cuz yeah not a lot of payroll

395
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,929
companies like if you show up with like

396
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:47,719
a garbage bag full of cash that's not

397
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:50,539
their usual operation what I noticed too

398
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,129
is when we started links we started

399
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:55,759
using it when we were shown under only

400
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:56,899
the medical pre ICO status and a lot of

401
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,730
patients that took them off-guard at

402
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,198
first or like whoa what is this you know

403
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,889
what's happening they weren't used to

404
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:06,528
this and then when adult you started it

405
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:08,480
was second nature to them to pay with

406
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:09,889
their card they are taken off guard if

407
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,319
they can't pay with their card anywhere

408
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:13,999
so for us it's been a great system for

409
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:16,519
us it allows for us to have legit cash

410
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:19,939
clarify when you say their card you mean

411
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:21,860
their gift card so what they do is with

412
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:25,338
a lynx pay card what they're doing is

413
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:29,869
they come in they load a Lynx gift card

414
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:33,679
and blank ones we have blank ones and

415
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:36,350
then it is get they load the card here

416
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:38,240
and then it's immediately redeemed they

417
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,800
can always load their card for more and

418
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,709
it can be used at other links pay

419
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,568
facilities and there are a few locations

420
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,489
of dispensaries here and Los Angeles

421
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:49,578
that utilize this system and it's

422
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,709
growing every day so you guys it seems

423
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:54,409
like one of the first when we work okay

424
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:58,128
that's kind of cool so on the payroll

425
00:16:54,409 --> 00:17:00,980
side you're also using links so we're

426
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:02,480
use links taps into that account and

427
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,159
then our payroll is pulled from that

428
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,110
account so I'm not constantly we're not

429
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:07,850
constantly going to the bank depositing

430
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,158
money in ordered a credit union

431
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:12,259
depositing money in the account so that

432
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:14,870
payroll can be covered so considering

433
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:18,379
for us about half of our patients and

434
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:19,989
customers utilize card services versus

435
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,120
Green Cross which is a little bit less

436
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:25,250
however it allows for us to make sure

437
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,828
that we have funds available links pays

438
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,048
also can transfer tax payments to the

439
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:31,879
city and state for us so they can

440
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,918
actually hold our funds and pay those

441
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,299
fees and they're actually working on a

442
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,149
process right now where they'll be able

443
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:39,349
to actually pay our vendors as well so

444
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:42,229
they're working kind of this

445
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:44,359
intermediary right now while banking

446
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,548
services are getting set up and more

447
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,819
standardized and we're I can't wait till

448
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:48,379
we can

449
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:50,599
utilize banks normally I mean for

450
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,440
ourselves we only pay vendors and check

451
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:56,359
form we don't pay in cash at all however

452
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:01,580
however other stores have a different

453
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:03,048
situation because we don't even really

454
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:05,388
do that as much at Green Cross because

455
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:07,668
it's a little bit different I would say

456
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:09,589
paying with cheques is unique but the

457
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,360
reason I brought up links to answer this

458
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,158
question is when you have payroll

459
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,079
process by a professional payroll

460
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:17,090
company they're gonna want it attached

461
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:18,949
to an account that is not going to

462
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:20,378
overdraw and things like that so I think

463
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,250
that a lot of the reasons that that

464
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:24,408
dispensaries or other cannabis

465
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,058
businesses don't use professional

466
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:27,500
payroll services and things like that is

467
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:31,038
because of the lack of access to

468
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,109
accounting because they've never done it

469
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,000
and so they don't know how to do it and

470
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:36,109
that is a big issue in our industry it's

471
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,628
like oh we've been doing it this way for

472
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:41,538
ten years and but we're not the same

473
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:44,449
industries we were six months ago I mean

474
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:45,589
things are changing so rapidly that and

475
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,629
that's a big issue that I'm seeing in

476
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:49,369
general in our industry is people it's

477
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:51,859
not that they're not wanting to do it

478
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:52,699
they're scared they're fearful because

479
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:54,469
they're afraid they're gonna make a

480
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,360
mistake or something's gonna happen and

481
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,250
so you'd rather just continue doing it

482
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:02,148
the wrong way because they've been doing

483
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:06,490
it that way forever so every two weeks

484
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:09,979
your employees either get a check or

485
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,628
direct deposit yes that's how we

486
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,339
actually I think I think all of my

487
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:15,288
employees get direct deposit and mine as

488
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:17,028
well Cassie and I come from other

489
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:20,179
industries where we're bringing our best

490
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:23,210
practices to this to this emerging

491
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:25,220
market and to an order for us and in a

492
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,798
lot of ways it's it's money-saving I

493
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,079
mean we're getting to not have to stress

494
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:31,548
out about things that we did back in the

495
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,398
past which is great because we have new

496
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:36,918
stuff to stress about but for us it's

497
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:39,319
like banking and access to banking and

498
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,120
credit unions access to credit card

499
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:43,908
processing and debit card processing

500
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,288
systems has been what has helped us the

501
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,320
most on actually making sure that

502
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:50,000
payroll is covered and you know bills

503
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,230
are paid and that's why we switched

504
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,970
completely over to cheques

505
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,349
I missed the days when I worked in

506
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,240
veterinary medicine when I could order

507
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:57,980
everything and put it on a card or order

508
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,079
everything and didn't I get a bill later

509
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,460
in the month and I pay it with a cheque

510
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,929
and I'm used to working with

511
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,910
distributors in the veterinary world

512
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,410
that's all I ever worked with was I had

513
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,120
three or four distributors that pretty

514
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:12,050
much o carried everything you would need

515
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:14,329
from cotton balls to Sentinel and that's

516
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:16,159
what we how we handled it and as I've

517
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:19,519
noticed that when we switch from paying

518
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,529
cash to four things it allows us to

519
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,910
better budget our money it's just like

520
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:25,910
our own accounts like I remember when I

521
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,320
was a waiter when I was in college and

522
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,180
it was much more difficult than when I

523
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:31,159
would get a bill for you know 200 bucks

524
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,840
is my car payment and I'm have to take

525
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,570
money from every single day to put aside

526
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:37,399
for that it's a lot better for us when

527
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,929
we can just we have money sitting there

528
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,670
waiting for it and to be able to pay

529
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,220
these bills without that stress involved

530
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,650
and I feel like the first three years I

531
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,819
was in cannabis that was a huge portion

532
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,000
of the consider and I've always been a

533
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:51,230
buyer in this industry is you know it's

534
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,329
almost like you're constantly stealing

535
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:58,579
from Peter to pay Paul while you still

536
00:20:53,329 --> 00:21:00,589
owe money to Ringo and that was always

537
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:02,059
very stressful I think honestly that is

538
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:03,980
been one of the reasons why our stores

539
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:05,720
have been pretty flush with product for

540
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,490
the most part is because of my

541
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,440
relationships with my vendors is that I

542
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,200
do my best to never put stuff on

543
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,570
consignment unless I absolutely needed

544
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,580
to I've always made sure the payments

545
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:18,169
were worth taking care of if not there

546
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:20,299
was significant communication on how we

547
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:23,630
could handle that and it's just honestly

548
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:25,309
running a budget in cannabis was such a

549
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,770
joke for so many years because it was

550
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:30,470
just a day-to-day business what you made

551
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:32,809
is what you made and now we can start

552
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,460
not just looking at things from a

553
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,799
payroll perspective every two weeks but

554
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,450
from a larger perspective of starting to

555
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,190
look at monthly budgets and quarterly

556
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,120
budgets and yearly budget perspective

557
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:45,950
budget and what we can afford for

558
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,169
payroll so we know that payroll should

559
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:50,809
be realistically taking you know fifteen

560
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,340
to thirty percent of our budget and you

561
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,919
know if we're sitting there where we've

562
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:57,769
grown so much recently at times that

563
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:00,740
we're making up 10% or 11% of our budget

564
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:02,329
is payroll that is a key thing

565
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,740
forecasting high when we need to go and

566
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:05,809
say hey we need to hire people we're

567
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,490
sitting here only making a 11% of our

568
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:09,079
budget is going towards payroll that

569
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,690
means we need to do raises and we need

570
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,759
to do hiring so that we can fill that

571
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,960
void because I know as much as like

572
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,980
saving money and it's like no you're

573
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,759
really not because you're burning out

574
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,769
your staff and so for us it's and a big

575
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,349
component to that is now offering paid

576
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:26,450
time off I myself took vacation this

577
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:28,069
summer for a week the last week of June

578
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,730
so I didn't have to be here for the July

579
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:33,859
1st deadline and and Cassie just came

580
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:36,230
back from vacation herself and for us as

581
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:38,000
directors we get burnt out really

582
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:40,690
quickly I mean we're working 50 60 hour

583
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,609
weeks regularly and I'm traveling

584
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,289
significantly for my job as well and I

585
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:46,639
get burnt out and when I'm able to just

586
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:49,460
step away take a three or four day

587
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,770
weekend and come back at it I'm able to

588
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,180
just my productivity soars and we've

589
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,980
noticed that if it's doing that for me

590
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,259
how could it not do that for the rest of

591
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,059
my staff I want to go back to what you

592
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:01,970
said about what we were doing being

593
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:04,190
unique and I think that absolutely it is

594
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,960
unique in cannabis but what's kind of

595
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:10,700
ridiculous is that it's not unique

596
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:12,769
anywhere else if you were to log in and

597
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,660
this is I think how we've really modeled

598
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:16,639
is that we've turned on sample let's not

599
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,290
look at how cannabis does it but how if

600
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,060
we were in a cannabis business and we

601
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:22,460
were just trying to sell a totally

602
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:24,799
normal product how would we do it what

603
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,650
rules would we follow so we try instead

604
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,970
of seeing cannabis as something that's

605
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,009
totally unique and different we're

606
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,079
trying to make it an industry is similar

607
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,150
to other industries as possible as we

608
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:37,429
want to be treated as well there's just

609
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:40,220
sometimes translation that has to happen

610
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,600
there so we there's the way we want to

611
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,130
be able to do things like when I first

612
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,599
started wanting to write cheques and

613
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,510
doing this I mean I told all my vendors

614
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,039
basically if you don't accept cheques we

615
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,569
don't buy your product and it was a way

616
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,670
for all of the and it wasn't as

617
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:54,319
surprised I wasn't surprised that a lot

618
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,759
of these people could actually accept

619
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,019
them there was very few people that I've

620
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,509
had that are like oh we don't accept

621
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:01,339
cheques and if you don't accept cheques

622
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:03,500
then who are you writing payroll to like

623
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:05,029
where is your payroll coming from and I

624
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,859
feel like you know this industry is

625
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:09,859
moving forward and you know where I was

626
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:12,289
at four years ago where I felt very I'm

627
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:14,750
gonna use word unique however it was to

628
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:17,659
a lot of people it was not understanding

629
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,930
the industry and now seeing where I am

630
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:23,150
is I'm I have many other colleagues and

631
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,920
peers that operate in the same capacity

632
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,580
as I do and they were pushing for the

633
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,820
same standards for us

634
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:28,819
as well

635
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:33,689
not only do we start like a whole

636
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:35,038
onboarding process where we're making

637
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,778
sure people are filling out all the

638
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,579
appropriate paperwork to get things like

639
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:41,339
direct deposit in the appropriate

640
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:45,720
payroll taxes and federal taxes taken

641
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:48,658
out of their payments we do do an

642
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,759
extensive training program that includes

643
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:52,619
mostly cannabis classes but the one

644
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:54,360
other class that everybody has to take

645
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:56,519
with us is sexual harassment and

646
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,109
workplace etiquette and again this is

647
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,470
something that I feel like it's very

648
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:04,378
typical in most industries and non

649
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,999
existent in the cannabis industry sexual

650
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:08,730
harassment is very rampant in the

651
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:11,278
cannabis industry not just in retail

652
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,230
locations where I have I have heard

653
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,288
people say like well you don't need more

654
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:21,929
than a girl in a bikini to sell cannabis

655
00:25:15,288 --> 00:25:25,919
and but that mentality in and of itself

656
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:29,669
is just a little bit unfair so I think

657
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:34,799
that between between the misogyny and in

658
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:37,499
some businesses and just the culture in

659
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,210
general of our society right now it's an

660
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:41,190
important conversation to have in any

661
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,139
workplace I think to sit down and say

662
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,950
here's our expectations what are your

663
00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:47,368
questions

664
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,109
what unhear feels you know wrong to you

665
00:25:47,368 --> 00:25:50,548
or right or these kind of things so it's

666
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:53,668
a nice place to at least start a

667
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:54,808
conversation in that in that course but

668
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:57,749
I would say you know you asked before

669
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:59,158
about difficulties with employees this

670
00:25:57,749 --> 00:26:01,649
is one of the things I feel like I run

671
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,739
into the most in the cannabis industry

672
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:07,558
is is sexual harassment cases but it's

673
00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:10,470
gotten I think I feel that it's gotten

674
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:12,269
become less and less than when I first

675
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:15,989
got into the industry and the problem

676
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:17,489
was is now it's shifted from it went

677
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:18,989
from being ownership and managers as

678
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:22,409
being the perpetrators to now it's

679
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:24,840
peer-on-peer usually and which is not

680
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:28,889
technically sexual harassment unless is

681
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:30,418
making other people uncomfortable if it

682
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:32,248
is just blatant sexual harassment

683
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,950
instead of just passive sexual

684
00:26:32,249 --> 00:26:37,499
harassment or quid pro quo sexual

685
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,509
harassment and it has been something

686
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:41,730
that we deal with but as we

687
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:43,980
professionalize all of these other asks

688
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:46,470
of the way we run our business that one

689
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,420
is shrinking because we're weeding out

690
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,730
people that feel that it's appropriate

691
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,830
to make certain comment or to do certain

692
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,809
things and that make people

693
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:56,669
uncomfortable however we also work in a

694
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:59,549
very much oh and a lot of ways in adult

695
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:02,430
business and so there are sometimes

696
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:04,379
banter and dialogue that could play

697
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:07,650
somebody else in a uncomfortable

698
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,000
situation so we do talk with our you

699
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,460
know when our staff when we're hiring it

700
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,019
on that you know some people may feel

701
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,940
uncomfortable with cuss words and they

702
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,950
may feel and that's something where I

703
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:22,019
can personally say I have a difficult

704
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:23,730
time with because I cuss and but never

705
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:26,430
in a way where I'm like calling somebody

706
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,319
a name or whatever well yeah I'm not not

707
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:30,420
in that situation at all

708
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,859
but casting I work a lot on sexual

709
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,880
harassment and workplace etiquette and

710
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:37,259
what I'm actually going to be adding

711
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,940
Cassie and I both are is like race insa

712
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:41,190
tivity and gender sensitivity and we do

713
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:45,210
talk about gender issues in our current

714
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:47,279
training however we're noticing recently

715
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,930
in this industry and everywhere else

716
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,819
that we're needing to have some

717
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,049
conversations where that can be

718
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:53,579
uncomfortable at times and we just

719
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:55,470
create a dialogue to where it's like you

720
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:56,759
know we want to be able to talk about

721
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,620
these things so that you feel

722
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,029
comfortable understanding where we're at

723
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:01,919
and where the industry is going and and

724
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:03,779
there's still some old-school people

725
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,430
that are just like I can't say this I

726
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:07,259
can't say that that's not PC that's not

727
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,299
PC and it's like it's not whatever you

728
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:11,970
choose to say on your own is your

729
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:14,609
business but when you're here on the you

730
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,650
know on the clock and representing our

731
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:20,099
stores this is how you will discuss

732
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,720
things and it is interesting seeing the

733
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:23,039
evolution of this especially since it's

734
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,900
happening I feel like in a lot of ways

735
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,690
so rapidly like we're all under such a

736
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,160
microscope right now and as we should I

737
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,870
mean it allows us to clean house and

738
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,730
prevent some of those issues that in the

739
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:34,409
past we've just shrugged off as no big

740
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,259
deal and now we're starting to realize

741
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,850
it's like no they are a big deal so just

742
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:40,319
quickly can you give me the nuts and

743
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:45,719
bolts of your training like it's an

744
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:46,980
online course in person sure so we're

745
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,009
actually kind of in the process of

746
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,870
transitioning it through with our we

747
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:54,980
have like a company who gives us some HR

748
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:57,109
support and they have even more

749
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,058
intense trainings that we hope to take

750
00:28:57,109 --> 00:29:01,159
advantage of in the near future but for

751
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:02,329
right now yeah we teach the course so

752
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,919
you have to sit in a room with me and

753
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:05,210
like I put on my powerpoint and we talk

754
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:15,429
about what's appropriate and what's not

755
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:18,259
and any questions that you may have no

756
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:20,179
it's part of the onboarding process and

757
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:22,069
then that's why we're actually looking

758
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:24,950
to to partner with the HR company

759
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:27,319
because they have more like continuing

760
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,058
education videos so we're they're just

761
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:31,548
like a little bit shorter segments on

762
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:33,678
specific issues that we could do as you

763
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:35,150
know every six months you have to take

764
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,740
something like this one of the things

765
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,240
I've learned in training in all

766
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,099
industries this is not specific to

767
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,720
cannabis is not everybody understands

768
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:42,918
that the first time they've heard it you

769
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,789
know I could sit down and say all this

770
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:45,230
stuff and you could be listening my

771
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:46,940
powerpoint going sure that all makes

772
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,798
sense but you know a year into your

773
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,230
employment is you're more comfortable at

774
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:55,250
all these things you just might forget

775
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:57,529
what some of those specific details were

776
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:59,089
so I think anytime I'd like to do the

777
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,619
same thing with cannabis information you

778
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:03,529
know every once in a while a refresher

779
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:06,379
course is really helpful and a reminder

780
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:07,730
that we take this seriously so you know

781
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,870
if you have to sit through that every

782
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,210
six months you're definitely gonna

783
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:13,069
question that comment a little bit more

784
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,630
than you might if oh yeah they said that

785
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:17,178
when I first started working here but

786
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,919
that was two years ago and you know it's

787
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:21,440
we're all having fun I really like for

788
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,000
us to continue we we are both very much

789
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,429
more hands-on with our team as far as

790
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,190
training and I feel like that comes from

791
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:30,559
a place of mentorship that if my staff

792
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,600
understands my expectations and they

793
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,970
understand Cassie's expectations they're

794
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,558
more likely to live up to those and know

795
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,929
when I'm gonna have to sit down and have

796
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,910
a conversation with you about this we

797
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:43,370
can go back to that training session

798
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:45,529
that I know that you were informed on so

799
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:47,629
I actually don't mind I run a smaller

800
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:49,190
team Cassie has a larger one but we were

801
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:52,190
contained about helping each other out

802
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:54,169
with training so like Cassie and I have

803
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:56,330
a class that we what the fundamentals of

804
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:58,790
cannabis but there are portions of it

805
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:00,439
that I teach more often and there's

806
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:01,639
questions that she teaches more often

807
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,308
solely from the fact that I have a

808
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:08,110
stronger medical background and that's

809
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:08,109
why I usually teach those portions of it

810
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,190
compliance is on everybody's mind right

811
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,530
now the Labour peace agreement that

812
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:19,559
every you know dispensary here has to

813
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:20,789
sign in the California state requires

814
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,490
that for twenty or more employees

815
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:25,259
however LA has a little bit more strict

816
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,920
and they required for ten or more

817
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:30,869
employees

818
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,960
and actually when we went to that when

819
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:35,039
we were pressed with that we actually

820
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,799
the time did not have ten employees

821
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,049
however we did enter into it I I'm

822
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:43,799
basically the liaison for both AMG and

823
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:45,180
Green Cross for UFCW and so I worked

824
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:47,460
with them and made sure that everything

825
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,900
was done there we're waiting for them to

826
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,120
come in and have their meeting with our

827
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,980
team but we have done everything we were

828
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,909
actually probably two of the first

829
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,750
stores that actually signed

830
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:59,779
documentation regarding that UFCW

831
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:02,640
represents pharmacies and I believe

832
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:05,099
grocery stores they represent several

833
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,410
large groups and a lot of people in this

834
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:09,089
industry are against unions and several

835
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,290
people are for them however from the

836
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:12,240
director point of view we have to be

837
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:15,029
completely neutral which is great

838
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,589
because I am completely neutral on it

839
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:18,210
I'll just be honest about that like I

840
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:20,759
believe that there's pros and cons to

841
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:23,789
both sides of the and I also see that

842
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,589
this industry in order for us to move

843
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:27,089
forward we need to step up our our

844
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:28,619
business practices specifically

845
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:33,599
regarding payroll this has been an

846
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:35,759
industry that has always neglected their

847
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,849
employees while spending money in other

848
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,680
areas that were totally not necessary if

849
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:42,689
you would literally just invest in your

850
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,549
staff and a lot of that has to go with

851
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,500
also keeping good staff on I mean staff

852
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:48,539
turnover is terrible for your business

853
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,819
of any kind and again veterinary world

854
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:52,799
when I when I was working in that the

855
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:55,799
average veterinary technician works for

856
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,450
a clinic for 11 months well you take you

857
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:00,329
three four months to teach them the way

858
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,340
that you do them at you know animal more

859
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:03,960
to see clinic and here and then it but

860
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:05,519
it's different at another place and the

861
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,230
same thing for us you know when we come

862
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,910
on it takes people a good three months

863
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,110
before they kind of find their grooves

864
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:13,950
on where they're at I think it's very

865
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:16,139
typical with any business and yeah I

866
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,730
mean that has been actually actually one

867
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,980
of my favorite parts of this job is

868
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:21,990
mentoring bringing new people on because

869
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,788
we're literally sculpting the future of

870
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,288
cannabis by taking care of our employees

871
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:26,940
right now I mean these are the future

872
00:33:25,288 --> 00:33:29,339
leaders in our industry the future

873
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,989
managers the future sales reps if we can

874
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:32,069
set high standards now with them but if

875
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:35,038
we're gonna set high standards we also

876
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:40,678
need to pay better and offer good

877
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:47,608
benefit so can you talk about staying on

878
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:50,340
the what what's if they didn't exist

879
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:55,739
versus they do exist like what does it

880
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:58,769
meet your business sure so when I first

881
00:33:55,739 --> 00:34:00,269
heard about the cannabis Union a couple

882
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:02,519
years ago what I was starting to give

883
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:04,048
him to the industry everybody was saying

884
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:05,548
what they're really here to do is kind

885
00:34:04,048 --> 00:34:07,769
of hit on some of these issues that I

886
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:09,780
was also concerned with that you have

887
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:11,280
people who are being underpaid or not

888
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,619
being paid overtime and all these other

889
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,569
things so the advice that I was given at

890
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:18,088
that point is take the Union Standards

891
00:34:15,568 --> 00:34:20,279
and try and beat them because then you

892
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:22,440
have no reason for your employees to

893
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,179
feel that hey well you're I'm supposed

894
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,168
to be treated better you know if you

895
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,639
would turn around it same thing with

896
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:28,558
minimum wage things like that if the

897
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,450
state is saying this is what we have to

898
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,149
do like shouldn't we try and do it a

899
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:35,608
little bit better because that makes our

900
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:37,980
company a little bit more competitive so

901
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:39,929
I think them being out there is good

902
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,969
because it's this idea it holds you

903
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:45,000
accountable if I'm not treating my

904
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:48,148
employees right they can form a mutiny

905
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,239
and I feel like that is that's the only

906
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:52,918
way but we make sure that everybody

907
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,138
across the board is acting in that

908
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,269
ethical way so I don't feel threatened

909
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:00,150
by it because I feel like it's an option

910
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:01,469
to to do better and to make sure that

911
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,230
we're treating people in an ethical way

912
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:06,358
and they actually help in an area that

913
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:09,210
we've suffered with and the cannabis

914
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:11,848
industry is just communication so they

915
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,338
can be the mediator a mediator on a

916
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:17,068
topic for us and and to help us find

917
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:18,750
solutions and that is where I think that

918
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:21,568
a lot of people are maybe against unions

919
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:24,510
in other industries and but seeing how

920
00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:26,639
they've worked with us so well and

921
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,260
wanting to to just basically as an

922
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,298
informational source like if we have any

923
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,089
questions I can reach out to them I get

924
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:34,798
a response with rapidly and and it's

925
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:36,150
been great to see how they're going to

926
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:37,199
be able to help us set these standards

927
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,300
and as Cassie

928
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,799
like those are just minimums we should

929
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,660
always exceed those from my

930
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,760
understanding of how they would

931
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:48,328
interject here as if we have a situation

932
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,890
that we have a staff member reports back

933
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:56,910
to the Union regarding workplace safety

934
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:59,179
OSHA pay missing not getting paid for a

935
00:35:56,909 --> 00:36:01,379
lunch break that they worked through

936
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:04,980
they would actually help us make sure

937
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:07,349
that everything was was solved and from

938
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,750
my understanding the Union also a lot of

939
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:12,150
ways prevents them from picketing as

940
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,588
well because they go through them and

941
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,940
they are the ones that work as a

942
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,828
mediator to make sure that their needs

943
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,769
are met and to make sure that we're

944
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:21,839
meeting these minimums which for me the

945
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:24,358
minimum when I saw the the requirements

946
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,608
I was like great we were gonna do this

947
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:28,348
anyways but the city of Los Angeles

948
00:36:26,608 --> 00:36:29,429
requires us to have it for ten or more

949
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:30,990
employees I can't think of any

950
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:34,379
dispensary right now that it would have

951
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:36,179
less than ten employees the regulation

952
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,059
says we basically have to let the Union

953
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:42,348
come in and talk to employees so that if

954
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:45,750
the employees want to join a union yes

955
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:47,160
yes so that's that's where it is so then

956
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,539
basically if they come in and touch your

957
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:50,098
employees and say they have to pay you

958
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,719
at least this much or like you can come

959
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,910
to me and all my employees are going

960
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:56,699
yeah they pay me that much then there's

961
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:58,199
not really that much mediation necessary

962
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:00,358
now if they were to come in and say you

963
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,159
are owed overtime and my employees are

964
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:03,989
like well I work 50 hours a week and

965
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,789
never got paid overtime then there would

966
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:08,129
absolutely be mediation there where they

967
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:11,460
would help us make sure we got compliant

968
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:13,440
when I talk to the UFCW they were

969
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,030
discussed about a lot of the issues that

970
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,220
we have in our industry regarding

971
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,510
misogyny and pay where people are

972
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:21,149
getting paid cash at the end of every

973
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:23,310
day and and taxes are not being paid

974
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,930
properly these are areas where they're

975
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:26,909
gonna come in and just assist on those

976
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:28,318
things however for us I mean it's just

977
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:29,868
one thing that we can check off of our

978
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:31,949
list and move on to the next thing

979
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:33,329
slowly from the fact is that we already

980
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:35,730
met all of those requirements in the

981
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:37,560
first place so it's just I actually have

982
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,929
another fabulous example sorry were to

983
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,059
go back on one more they came into our

984
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:45,118
dispensary not necessarily to do this

985
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:46,559
meeting where they could talk about pay

986
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,440
raises and things like that but they

987
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,509
actually came in supporting a record

988
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,608
expungement clinic they were saying hey

989
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:54,980
if you or anybody on staff has a felony

990
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:57,650
on this day we're supporting this where

991
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,088
you can come in and fix those records

992
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,789
because that's something now that the

993
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:04,699
city and the state is is allowing for so

994
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:06,460
they were kind of helping staff members

995
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:09,618
and other members of the community

996
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:12,470
through that process because sometimes

997
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:14,838
legal processes are not as easy as that

998
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:16,489
so okay yeah I know how I now I can get

999
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:18,980
my record expunged but how do I do that

1000
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:20,779
so the union is there for them to kind

1001
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,088
of help walk them through that and I

1002
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,130
think the idea of unionization in

1003
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:27,349
general is that together our voice is

1004
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:29,358
stronger than and separate so if you

1005
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:31,640
have an entity out there that's fighting

1006
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:32,630
for employee rights in the cannabis

1007
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:34,670
industry

1008
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:37,760
you could say take four dispensaries

1009
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:39,230
that were not up to par with what

1010
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,119
they're doing and all those employees

1011
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,280
can band together to talk about it so

1012
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,950
that increases that voice and increases

1013
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,440
that power rather than just you know one

1014
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:49,429
employee trying to fight their boss that

1015
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,010
might not be the most empowering

1016
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:53,868
situation the regulations are also

1017
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:55,970
putting some stuff into play regarding

1018
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:58,400
hiring practices you have to hire from

1019
00:38:55,969 --> 00:39:02,659
certain diverse populations transitional

1020
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,730
workers everybody has people have to be

1021
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:06,588
within a certain radius and these are

1022
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,358
really interesting things because as

1023
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:10,818
person who's hiring you can't

1024
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:12,588
necessarily ask these questions you know

1025
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:14,659
are you a single parent it's not

1026
00:39:12,588 --> 00:39:19,699
something that you can ask in an

1027
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:21,469
interview but keeping tabs on your the

1028
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:23,929
diversity of your staff is something

1029
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:25,639
required by the regulations so this is

1030
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:29,328
another really tricky piece where we

1031
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:30,529
deal with confidentiality and just

1032
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,810
making sure that you're doing things the

1033
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:35,390
correct way you can't just go around

1034
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:36,619
asking people about these questions you

1035
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:38,328
have to be creating you know

1036
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:51,710
confidential surveys and things like

1037
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:53,869
that to collect this data pretty much

1038
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,970
yep and what they're asking for at this

1039
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:57,680
point doesn't necessarily go along with

1040
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:59,809
the hiring practice it's basically just

1041
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:01,328
give us a rundown of what your current

1042
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:02,828
staff looks like

1043
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:05,380
then we have to show a good faith effort

1044
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:08,769
that we try to hire from these

1045
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:11,170
populations or that we try and hire from

1046
00:40:08,768 --> 00:40:13,028
local areas so with local areas we've

1047
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:16,059
definitely done that you know as we go

1048
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:18,369
through reaching out to hire as you have

1049
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:21,160
it is quite difficult for me though to

1050
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:25,079
hire from my the radius around my store

1051
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:25,078
because our store is in Bel Air

1052
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:31,509
difficult to necessarily hire the staff

1053
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:33,400
that we need because as I'm the director

1054
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:36,608
of the store and I still can't afford to

1055
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,160
live in Bel Air and neither do the

1056
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:41,018
owners because it is so I mean it's such

1057
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:42,879
an expensive area for us to live so it

1058
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:44,738
it's an area where I have issues with I

1059
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,789
wanted to bring up the diverse hiring

1060
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:48,909
plan because I think that's something

1061
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:50,349
kind of unique to cannabis they if the

1062
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:51,458
social equity program is kind of the

1063
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:53,680
same thing

1064
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:55,868
not every industry has so many

1065
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:59,259
reparations to make so that's definitely

1066
00:40:55,869 --> 00:41:01,630
part of our struggle and it's a

1067
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:03,278
complicates complicated to collect this

1068
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,838
data and then know exactly what to do

1069
00:41:03,278 --> 00:41:07,809
with it so that's something I think kind

1070
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:09,159
of falls under the HR bubble a little

1071
00:41:07,809 --> 00:41:11,048
bit that people are dealing with maybe

1072
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:12,728
not sure how and some of these

1073
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:14,409
reparations are owed by the government

1074
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:16,899
and some of them are owed by ourselves

1075
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:19,478
in the cannabis industry where we've not

1076
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,940
had good business practices and and

1077
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:23,978
hiring practices so you know we need to

1078
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,229
start writing those wrongs that we had

1079
00:41:23,978 --> 00:41:29,379
of the past where it's quite often when

1080
00:41:26,228 --> 00:41:32,468
I'm in a group of cannabis business

1081
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:35,019
owners that they're predominantly white

1082
00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:37,630
men however african-american men are

1083
00:41:35,018 --> 00:41:41,078
disproportionately put behind bars for

1084
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:43,209
cannabis related drug charges and I

1085
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:45,670
think that when people denied that white

1086
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:47,469
privilege exists I say okay look at the

1087
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,119
cannabis industry if you're telling me

1088
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:51,969
that white privilege doesn't exist just

1089
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,400
look at how we run our industry whereas

1090
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:56,949
predominantly done by white men and you

1091
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,059
know I do my best to as a white man as

1092
00:41:56,949 --> 00:42:04,298
well but also being a minority for that

1093
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:05,619
I'm gay and that I have a disability not

1094
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:07,958
that I can understand the perspective

1095
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:10,239
however I don't have never adhere to the

1096
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:11,919
white male mentality straight male

1097
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,130
mentality in a lot of ways no offense

1098
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,130
and

1099
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,360
and you know I try to support minorities

1100
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:22,500
in this industry because we need that

1101
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,500
voice to be heard

1102
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:33,709
