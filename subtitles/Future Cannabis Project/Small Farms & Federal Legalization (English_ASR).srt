[Music]

2
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:17,879
I told people they're gonna have to like

3
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:22,050
let 30 to 50 acres open up in Willis

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:24,570
Covell Oh like and we'll you know Layton

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,510
Ville you know all the small valleys and

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,160
you'll get like 15 jobs for per acre and

7
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,510
then you gonna have like $70,000 year

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,589
jobs and a lot of the small communities

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,480
can at least survive and they can have

10
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,268
like livelihoods and live well but

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,558
you're not gonna see the the freewheel

12
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:39,058
and you know people making big bucks

13
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:40,378
anymore no I don't think on small farms

14
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:42,119
you're gonna you're just not going to

15
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:46,019
even on large farms any of the margins

16
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,609
not there you know one of the you know

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,379
kind of macro-environment things that

18
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,869
exists right now is if federal

19
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,058
legalization was able to happen in any

20
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:55,859
sort of reasonable rate if the walls

21
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,530
were able to come down and California

22
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,390
cannabis was illegal to you know send

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,030
throughout the country you know there

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,189
would be jobs jobs aplenty for farmers

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,200
all over California you know the small

26
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,569
you know five ten thousand you know

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,759
twenty thirty thousand square feet would

28
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:15,449
have a place because you know the

29
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,010
country is is a much much bigger market

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,510
than just California right now with

31
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,310
California we have a glut well also

32
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,450
break open worldwide obviously once you

33
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,519
go across the country you open the

34
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,650
worldwide markets up and then people

35
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,569
said that they for us they're more

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,868
triangle name will mean a lot more

37
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:32,459
outside of California outside of LA then

38
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:34,319
it will inside I think going around the

39
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,609
country but all that's definitely true

40
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,199
but it's holding on until then and at

41
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,489
this point it's such a rapid extinction

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,590
event you know most the people will be

43
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,629
gone before it ever gets there so it's

44
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,820
sad to see happen because you know at

45
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:49,500
our core at bloom farms we've we've

46
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:52,169
really built in to the culture of the

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,420
company our desire to support small

48
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,859
farmers you know 90% of our biomass

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,920
that's used to make our products is

50
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,840
sourced from small farmers and they're

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,780
just kind of starting to stop returning

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,850
calls and again and shutting down

53
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,090
operations and going out of business so

54
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:11,069
it's it's heartbreaking to see we've had

55
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,549
a similar experience at rosette we've

56
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:17,009
watched our farmers just implode and

57
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:20,700
it's been very difficult over the last

58
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:23,289
year to sustain their costs of getting

59
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:26,199
compliant getting their licensing

60
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:28,030
as a small farm one of the things that

61
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,459
I'd like to see and I'm not sure how it

62
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,449
would happen would be some type of

63
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:36,699
access to non predatory lending for

64
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:39,548
small farmers so they can actually get

65
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:41,438
ahead of their costs so they can

66
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:44,109
actually create a business that's what's

67
00:02:41,438 --> 00:02:46,479
really killing them right now if you

68
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:48,159
notice pretty much everybody's going out

69
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,068
and getting funding right now and it's a

70
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:53,259
business that's going to scale that's a

71
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:57,060
lot easier than a small farmer to

72
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:59,560
conceive and so you know I'd like to see

73
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,819
companies form that actually would bring

74
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,889
these farmers in and help create some

75
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:08,560
type of fund for them or government

76
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:10,959
funding for them of some kind because

77
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,750
that's really what could save the small

78
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,989
farm just like all of us really we need

79
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,680
the funds to get ahead of the Machine I

80
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:22,329
agree with that but also you know

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,159
systemically you know you can borrow all

82
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,750
the money in the world you can raise all

83
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,318
the money in the world but if the

84
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:32,348
margins just don't exist due to taxes

85
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:34,298
regulation costs for licensing the

86
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:36,638
margins don't exist there's no scenario

87
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:38,500
where you know any you know any amount

88
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,199
of funding in the world just doesn't

89
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,030
burn right through it's true but

90
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,030
everybody needs to get up to speed

91
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:50,109
everybody needs to basically get up to

92
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,419
speed they need that runway time for

93
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:55,030
something like national legalization or

94
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:58,479
the ability to cross borders into other

95
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,539
states so if they just like everybody

96
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:04,959
they have to be able to sustain that

97
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:07,358
transitional period and people say that

98
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,098
it could be legalized tomorrow or a year

99
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:11,620
from now but it seems like unless

100
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:13,000
something significant happens that we

101
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,000
are on the path towards federal

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,470
legalization when do you guys think that

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,668
would have you been a handicap yet when

104
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,699
do you think that's gonna happen

105
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,698
I

106
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,538
my gut instinct says that it's gonna

107
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:32,079
happen probably based on the next

108
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:33,759
presidential election and I think that

109
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,949
it's not going to happen till after that

110
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,589
because it's too much of a tool for a

111
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:40,279
president

112
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:42,560
so election that's just a guess but I

113
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,449
would say what happened sometime after

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,280
and I would guess that it would be it

115
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:49,069
that it's going to be a fairly hot topic

116
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:52,659
on the primary tickets and eventually

117
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:52,659
the real race

118
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,259
you
