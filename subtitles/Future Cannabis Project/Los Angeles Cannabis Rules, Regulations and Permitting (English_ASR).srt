[Music]

2
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:22,799
so finding an appropriate location to

3
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,410
operate your whether it is 5,000 square

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,539
feet 10,000 I'm 10,000 square foot

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,969
canopy right so you know you're aligning

6
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:35,219
this with state law or up to 22,000

7
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:36,629
square foot canopy and in what location

8
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,379
okay so knowing that you're gonna have

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,520
to have a $70,000 set aside for

10
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:44,250
application fees to the city and that's

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,750
you know broken up into inspection fees

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,820
and some other things but that probably

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,689
will be about that number although we're

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,579
again pushing for that hopefully to be

15
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,619
lessened but this is part of that

16
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,140
political and you know kind of advocacy

17
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:13,650
dialogue that we continue to have but

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:16,500
today as of today yeah you need to you

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,930
need to have the money to take you into

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,159
the regulated market in the city of LA

21
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:26,969
which incidentally seems rather

22
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:31,860
antithetical to a lot of the lip service

23
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:37,920
that is being paid to the smaller

24
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:40,890
operators the former offenders formerly

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,920
incarcerated folks equity however we end

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:58,379
up defining that it doesn't make a lot

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:02:01,379
of sense it is probably going to be

28
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:06,328
expensive now I say that because we also

29
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:11,489
have advocates even council president

30
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:13,919
Herb Wesson himself who really does want

31
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:17,969
to see opportunity

32
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,769
for smaller operators for folks who

33
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,900
would qualify for whatever the social

34
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,290
equity program looks like but he's not

35
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,939
the sole voice on the council and we the

36
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:29,459
the cannabis department here in the city

37
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:32,370
of La is headed up by a woman whose name

38
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,229
is Kat Packer who comes from drug policy

39
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,840
Alliance who also cares about these

40
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:39,269
issues so we will see but as I mentioned

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,870
earlier there are many voices in this

42
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,360
chorus and so Wow and and which is also

43
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,219
all the more reason why we need to be

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,930
involved in this process all the more

45
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,090
reason why people need to actually show

46
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,310
up to every hearing and why people need

47
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,719
to write and communicate with their City

48
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,689
Council members and get involved in

49
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:01,859
organizations this idea of checking out

50
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:04,949
of this process is that is an old way of

51
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,080
thinking and frankly as I have you know

52
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,000
said to many of my clients don't

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,610
complain to me that you don't like how

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,289
things worked out in a year two years

55
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,239
three years if you're not involved in

56
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:17,400
this process just don't do it I really I

57
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,530
don't want to hear it you know this is

58
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,420
we're all part of this experiment and we

59
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,819
have the responsibility to be involved

60
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,129
in this process absolutely and the thing

61
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,500
is you see on a state level there are

62
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,750
regulators and legislators who very much

63
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,370
want to listen to this industry and we

64
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,120
see the same thing in the city of Los

65
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,129
Angeles but it's also you know again be

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,239
psychologically smart and diplomatic

67
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:43,919
listen talk you know be sophisticated be

68
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,049
gentle all of the things that are

69
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,559
involved in a conversation with another

70
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:52,290
human being right educate help what is

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,090
it that you need right and that's also

72
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:56,548
part of this process and we're seeing

73
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,739
that thank goodness it's just again a

74
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:00,870
lot of this relationship that needs to

75
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,289
be repaired within our the cannabis

76
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,060
community and you know elected officials

77
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:08,489
city government state government law

78
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,189
enforcement etc and that's happening in

79
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,799
ten years it will be a world of

80
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:17,430
difference you know I'm just I am one of

81
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,410
mine that I want to help build this

82
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,000
structure and I want us all to help

83
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:26,000
build this structure and to help infuse

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,509
it with certain values that will really

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,009
benefit people

86
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:31,170
in this industry and outside of this

87
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:35,310
industry you know you have a West

88
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:38,040
Hollywood that does allow us some number

89
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:41,430
four or five dispensaries and is looking

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,860
at allowing labs and other types of

91
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,199
cannabis businesses and is looking at

92
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,180
you know these issues in them much more

93
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:54,110
reasonable and in some regard liberal

94
00:04:48,180 --> 00:05:00,290
way sure but you know but assumption bar

95
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:03,810
that's right but in terms of cultivation

96
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:08,640
there's a city of Port Hueneme that

97
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:13,079
passed local ordinance that seems on

98
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,849
some level fairly reasonable but you

99
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,099
know you're still dealing with you know

100
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,920
it's still a pretty voluminous

101
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,980
application process and fees and you

102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,680
know it's still it's still complicated I

103
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,240
I I believe because I also have many

104
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,090
good friends and we have clients and

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,009
humbled that that seemed to be a pretty

106
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:34,319
straightforward process and and I did

107
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:36,539
myself although my law partner Nicole

108
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,579
handled most of those but works with one

109
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,040
of my old old friends on this process

110
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:43,019
and she applied for cultivation and

111
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,080
manufacturing there and it was a pretty

112
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:49,229
straightforward process and humbled but

113
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,629
in Southern California you know we're

114
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:56,759
just we're a little slower on all of

115
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:58,740
this and I look forward to six months

116
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,079
from now when I will probably be able to

117
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,290
answer that question and give very

118
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:06,060
shining examples and certainly two years

119
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,060
and four years and five years from now

120
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:12,750
we will have an incredibly incredibly

121
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,689
different conversation when asked if I

122
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:19,589
want to or am cultivating cannabis in

123
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:22,319
California what do I do to follow all

124
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:24,119
the laws hot what are those rules and

125
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,620
regulations and they will all be set out

126
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,720
and it will all be a very somewhat or

127
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,459
much more well oiled machine

128
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,110
and I will be able to say here's where

129
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,909
you go here's what you'll see in this

130
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,310
city in this county here's the taxation

131
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,990
structure here are the challenges here's

132
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,009
the permitting process here's what it

133
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,749
will likely cost here

134
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,300
the state licensing process here's what

135
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:47,520
these fees and everything and and here

136
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,028
it it will be all clear the path will be

137
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,808
laid out and it will be a very very

138
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:53,808
different day

139
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,098
I am the chairwoman of the Los Angeles

140
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:03,109
cannabis taskforce and founded that

141
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:05,598
organization about two years ago the

142
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:11,870
reason we we really push the green house

143
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:17,120
thing is we know that that will that

144
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:22,610
will help our brothers and sisters in LA

145
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:25,280
County with their whole local political

146
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,840
process these cities and counties talk

147
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,029
to each other you know there's the

148
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,739
League of Cities and SESAC and you know

149
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:34,250
and they kind of they look at what each

150
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:37,300
other are doing right and as as folks in

151
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,728
the industry advocates lawyers we also

152
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:44,449
have to if we're going to be effective

153
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:46,128
and successful collaborate and thank

154
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:48,949
goodness

155
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:51,650
most most folks can kind of check their

156
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:54,650
egos at the door and recognize that this

157
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:56,810
is this must be this must be

158
00:07:54,649 --> 00:08:00,228
collaborative there must be listening

159
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:04,218
and speaking building an action but also

160
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:10,689
non action involved in in in this really

161
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:10,689
historical time the current proposals

162
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:20,810
yes I believe so and there's a huge

163
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:22,939
swath of the county where it's most most

164
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:28,509
of the AG land is located there that the

165
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:34,250
county is proposing to disallow

166
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:36,168
cultivation all of that said for month

167
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,500
four weeks ago in the city of Los

168
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:41,718
Angeles the city's proposal was not for

169
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,759
any business permit at all the first

170
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,490
draft regulations from the City of LA

171
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,250
said that these businesses are still

172
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,509
illegal and we will only give you guys a

173
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,860
limited immunity from criminal

174
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:59,360
prosecution no shit and and that's the

175
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:02,000
whole old way of thinking now we through

176
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,610
our organization through lobbying

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,159
efforts through talking with state

178
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,079
regulators through a massive effort

179
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,860
through a public hearing where there

180
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:14,059
were five overflow rooms

181
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,879
you have the council president Wesson

182
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:19,549
and three members of the council come

183
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:23,559
out publicly and writing letters to the

184
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:26,959
Planning Department saying go back and

185
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:29,929
read your aft your proposal these people

186
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,120
this industry needs businesses the state

187
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:35,419
has regulated cannabis it is thoroughly

188
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,000
absurd in the city of Los Angeles where

189
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:39,979
you have two-thirds of the voters voting

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,259
for the adult use of marijuana act and

191
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,870
82% of the voters voting YES on measure

192
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:47,769
M which was a local initiative that

193
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:51,110
specifically requested that the city

194
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:53,659
create a regulatory process and

195
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,330
licensing for cannabis businesses to

196
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:58,129
come out with a proposal where there is

197
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,340
literally there was language saying

198
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:05,149
these businesses are still illegal it is

199
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:07,580
a limited immunity and then action by

200
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:11,899
people in the industry well organized

201
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:17,570
action smart good public policy driven

202
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:19,329
arguments and we will see and we did see

203
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,890
a redraft of the zoning ordinance

204
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,990
assuming permitting so we're gonna have

205
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:27,919
permits so that was done in a span of

206
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:43,909
four weeks no kidding anything is

207
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:46,219
possible no kidding of course of course

208
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:50,839
and what I see over and over as someone

209
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:53,149
who devoted my practice to this fully

210
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,490
this is what I do all day long solely

211
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:58,069
focusing on this industry ten years ago

212
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:01,639
so I've seen a lot in California over

213
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,650
those ten years that is all more than

214
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:08,500
possible and what I see over and over

215
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:11,659
again is providing good information

216
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,450
accurate information good reasoning

217
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:17,209
behind why this huge swath of land

218
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:19,490
that's an agricultural area why we

219
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,259
should allow well-regulated cannabis

220
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,019
businesses to operate and let's talk

221
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:24,679
about what that would look like and

222
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:28,069
let's come up with

223
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:30,649
comprehensive but also fair proposal

224
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,410
that meets the needs of everyone over

225
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:36,549
and over I see us in terms of that

226
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:39,009
larger us prevailing over and over

227
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:40,939
because it's you know the

228
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:44,350
internationally our relationship to

229
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,790
marijuana cannabis hemp has

230
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,220
significantly changed internationally

231
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:51,740
the war on drugs has failed in the

232
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,870
United States every one people are into

233
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,959
cannabis whether it's for a cool fact or

234
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,778
a medical factor you know the hemp you

235
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:03,679
know the hemp issues like they're just I

236
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:06,289
mean you know innumerable it's it's this

237
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,750
is all around us you know this is all

238
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:13,819
around us and so it's about being smart

239
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:15,649
strategic and working very hard to push

240
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,510
that ball forward that's what we're

241
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,899
doing we are this is an emerging

242
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:24,559
industry in an emerging industry the law

243
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:27,759
and politics are not they you know it's

244
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:33,349
not comfortable there are growing pains

245
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:35,750
but over and over it's it's it's we we

246
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,430
went well past that tipping point and

247
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:41,059
certainly in California when you have

248
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:43,250
the state passing and working on now for

249
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:48,949
almost two years a comprehensive set of

250
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:53,089
laws legalizing cannabis and regulating

251
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:54,950
the industry and 16 plus state agencies

252
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,750
promulgating thousands of pages of rules

253
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:00,230
and regulations the state doing their

254
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:03,950
job it will trickle down in some form or

255
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:06,050
fashion so in this small like moment in

256
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,709
time and this kind of bandwidth of like

257
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:13,309
history-making being very involved in

258
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:16,250
those little all of those 540 separate

259
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:18,109
kingdoms in that process and giving

260
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,850
information and coming out and talking

261
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,730
about these issues in helping to build

262
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,970
those legal structures on a local level

263
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,028
so that you can then ladder up to state

264
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,240
licensing is what need people need to be

265
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:36,259
focused on you can't throw money at this

266
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,089
you can't turn your head away from it

267
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:38,360
and hope that it will all work out or

268
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:43,310
you

269
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,079
find yourself you know outside of the

270
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:47,899
legal market fully and you better

271
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:52,578
believe that when things are totally

272
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:54,620
clear that you are someone who is

273
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:58,309
growing cannabis with a state license

274
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:02,778
and a local permit or not and you're

275
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:06,919
just in a fully unregulated gray black

276
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:08,870
market that that is you know that is not

277
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,578
a place I would certainly want to find

278
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:14,209
myself and I don't want anyone to find

279
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:18,289
themselves in that place because you

280
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:20,958
know people you can still under under

281
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:24,110
Mao curse' you can still be you know you

282
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,419
can you you can still get a felony for

283
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,789
cultivation of cannabis it's very

284
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:36,429
interesting that seems like that's being

285
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:36,429
lost in this conversation anyway

286
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:55,189
