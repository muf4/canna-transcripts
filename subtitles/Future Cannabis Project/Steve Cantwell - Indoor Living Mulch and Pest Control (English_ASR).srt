1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,198
hey everybody greenlight productions

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,439
here

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,040
i apologize to loud noise the fans in

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,638
this silly mask

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,280
who are in a highly regulated indoor

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,919
facilities that's just how it is

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,678
now recently kiss organics and child

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,240
science both put out a video

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,079
sharing their opinion on the use of

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,439
cover crops companion plants

11
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,959
and living mulch indoors now these are

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
two credible individuals

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,160
who brought up valid points that

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
shouldn't be ignored

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,599
if in fact you want to use these systems

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,599
successfully indoors

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,280
in fact the only thing i disagree with

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,800
that they said

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,800
was just their opinion overall

20
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,718
and the only reason i'm sharing my

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,238
opinion with you is because both of them

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,200
name me in their video so i feel an

23
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,038
obligation at this point

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
now early on i didn't have a lot of

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,359
places to look or resources

26
00:00:52,799 --> 00:01:00,878
resources to look for information

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,759
so my primary teacher has always been

28
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,599
mother nature now mother nature has been

29
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:09,039
doing this bigger

30
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:12,798
longer and more successful than any of

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,400
us could ever imagine

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,759
so to say that we can't take those same

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,359
natural systems

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,000
that we've been studying for thousands

35
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,879
of years and apply that science

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,879
and those systems

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,439
in indoors controlled environment to me

38
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,679
just sounds kind of silly

39
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,879
so i'm going to share with you guys my

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,799
perspective and my opinion on this

41
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,920
from a martial arts standpoint more

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,439
specifically using jiu-jitsu

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,439
sounds silly but hear me out

44
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:52,559
now in jiu jitsu your opponent's

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,640
strengths can be used against them

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
and that's kind of the concept he pushes

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,040
i pull he pulls i push

48
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,798
uh you know you don't know you you go

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,118
with the flow versus trying to fight

50
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,399
things head on

51
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,639
you anticipate your opponent's moves

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,919
i grab his arm he pulls his arm i go

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,519
left he goes right

54
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,958
when you start to anticipate you know

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,719
the probability of what your

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,080
opponent is going to do you can make

57
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,000
better decisions

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
on how to trick your opponent how to

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,400
trap your opponent how to

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,200
do all these different things now let's

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,800
apply that

62
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:29,598
to a living system more specifically

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,599
our living mulch

64
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,318
now when we first started off we were

65
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,560
super clover heavy

66
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,119
that's what everybody was doing that's

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,000
what we were doing

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,840
after time a little bit of time we

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,039
started noticing that yeah clover

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,200
is definitely more problematic than the

71
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,799
solutions it provides

72
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,878
there's a lot easier ways to get

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,560
nitrogen into the system

74
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,159
than putting a nitrogen-fixing plant in

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,840
your soil that attracts and harbors

76
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,519
pests

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,920
so we cooled all the clover and we ran

78
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,800
brown mulch for a while strong wood

79
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,919
chips

80
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,599
didn't have much much cover crop going

81
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,479
down our soil

82
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,598
and we actually had bigger problems we

83
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,679
actually had more threat

84
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,719
pressure uh the spider mites that were

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,000
in our clovers

86
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:23,598
we're now crawling up our plants uh

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,039
things of that nature so then i started

88
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,318
studying these plants their strengths

89
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,280
and their weaknesses

90
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,759
and how i can use that to my advantage

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,759
so i'll use a couple

92
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,639
points would be the first time i

93
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:39,759
encountered green aphids

94
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:42,079
not a big deal but we'll get there so

95
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,560
when i first encountered green aphids

96
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,760
was in a large facility

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,360
commercial facility and

98
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,759
one of the things that i noticed right

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,360
away just by scouting my rooms and just

100
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,919
doing my due diligence

101
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,959
was the green aphids preferred

102
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,759
the clover over the cannabis and i had

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,280
clover all over my beds so they're going

104
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,759
from the clover to the cannabis from the

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,438
canvas to the clover and just this big

106
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,840
buffet aphid buffet going on

107
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,199
so what i did was i cooled all the

108
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,160
clover from all my

109
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:21,120
all my beds all my soils and then i

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,000
planted the clover in a small pot

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
and i placed several small plot pots to

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,439
be precise

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,879
and i placed that pot in the corner of a

114
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,800
room

115
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:36,000
and i drew all the aphids in that room

116
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,720
to that pot and then i busted out my

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,918
trusty old blow torch

118
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,520
and i sent them to help it's the most

119
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,719
organic way you can deal with things in

120
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:50,319
my opinion is fire

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,479
a little risky at times i i get it

122
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,599
so that's just one case where i took

123
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,319
something

124
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
that presented a problem i flipped the

125
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,240
script

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,919
and i made that problem a solution

127
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,280
so that brings me to my next point is

128
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:07,038
that everything can serve a purpose

129
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,038
if you know its strengths and weaknesses

130
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,199
and how to apply them

131
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,319
so just let's take for example this

132
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,600
country for for

133
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,800
for example we have a diverse population

134
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,199
of people

135
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,600
from from multiple countries all over

136
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,400
the world speaking multiple languages

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,720
so much good food so much good music so

138
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,839
much good parties

139
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,320
it's a poly culture america

140
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,399
is is a poly culture of people we have

141
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,000
we have multiple cultures

142
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,799
that coexist and it's an awesome place

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,360
now can you imagine if we were to

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,639
monoculture the united states

145
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,720
and now we have our rich white dudes

146
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
that would not be a fun place to live

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,639
i'm sorry

148
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,918
same concept goes with this soil in our

149
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,759
plants

150
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,758
our plants don't want to live in a in

151
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,919
beds surrounded by

152
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,840
clones of themselves there's no

153
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:05,599
biological intelligence

154
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,198
shared in that system so it doesn't make

155
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,280
sense to try to

156
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,360
to treat it like that i i don't see the

157
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:15,198
value in that

158
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,199
so going on to my aphids thing

159
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,119
green aphids were my first experience

160
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,400
using trap plants from there i learned

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,560
about banker plants

162
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,638
and having pollinators in the system

163
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,720
that can feed my predators

164
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,720
more in between pests out breaks keep

165
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,440
them around longer spend less money on

166
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,759
pests

167
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,959
and been successful at it now i'm going

168
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,720
to talk a little bit about some of the

169
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,918
plants we use and why

170
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,919
because i get this question a lot so

171
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,198
the primary plant that we use that

172
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,359
everybody always sees

173
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,160
i'll try to get it in here that's

174
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,160
dicondra

175
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,360
so that's basically the use what we use

176
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,560
that for

177
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,840
is just simply to cover the soil it's a

178
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,439
ground cover

179
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:02,399
it's easy to manage it it doesn't

180
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,918
need reseeding um it grows good in low

181
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,038
light but also

182
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,799
will die off in low light

183
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,560
and it's just an easy to manage plant

184
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,199
indoors so we use it to cover the soil

185
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,560
to keep it from eroding when we water

186
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,439
and all that good stuff

187
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,800
also we use chickweed another really

188
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:25,279
good ground cover

189
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:28,000
um it has a really good um

190
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,079
consistency to it as far as fluffy it

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,959
adds a really good aeration to the mulch

192
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,839
layer

193
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,038
it's not it doesn't uh get super heavy

194
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,679
and layered

195
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,439
it says fluffy like a sponge and it's a

196
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,160
really good environment

197
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,038
now both of these two cover crops are

198
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,759
are really

199
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,279
unfavored to most pests not to say that

200
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,759
pests won't linger on them

201
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,839
that would be untrue but it's not what

202
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,120
they want to eat it's it's not what they

203
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,038
look forward to eating

204
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,280
so i don't have to worry about an

205
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:01,360
abundance of problems growing down there

206
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,519
and then we also use from time to time

207
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,879
you'll see grasses

208
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,478
something to take into consideration

209
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,720
when you're choosing your cover crops

210
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,360
your companion plants or whatever

211
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,840
is their roots see our dichondra has

212
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
super

213
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,318
shallow roots and creates a thick carpet

214
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,000
across the top of the soil

215
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,759
where it's not really pumping sugar it's

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,560
pumping exudates deep

217
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,840
so it's not really expanding the biology

218
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,918
in the soil

219
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,519
to the depths that it could go so that's

220
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,198
why the grass is good it's going to have

221
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:33,360
much deeper roots

222
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,599
than the dichondra than the chickweed

223
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,080
so it's good to take into consideration

224
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,200
just how you're occupying that soil with

225
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,519
what

226
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,399
we also then use various companion

227
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,039
plants

228
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,360
like marigolds and brassicas and things

229
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,199
like that that produce biotoxins

230
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,278
that may kill an unwanted pest or

231
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,879
pathogen don't want to go too far down

232
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,240
that road it's a long one

233
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,159
with a lot of big words i can't

234
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,159
pronounce anyways

235
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,720
so with the combination of companion

236
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,479
plants

237
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:10,480
ground cover both brown mulch

238
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,080
and green mulch we have found success

239
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,240
now it's not to say that we haven't had

240
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,839
problems it's just that we always pay

241
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,639
attention and learn from them

242
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,040
we evolve we're not just going to give

243
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,720
up

244
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,639
the first time we see something that we

245
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,800
don't like when i find out

246
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,399
how to defeat it we're gonna rise to the

247
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,120
occasion

248
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,120
so that's my perspective on some of the

249
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,320
values of cover crops is at the end of

250
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,120
the day

251
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,519
you're gonna get pests you're gonna

252
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
they're gonna show up eventually

253
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,200
and if you don't have something else for

254
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,879
them to eat they're gonna be on your

255
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,720
cannabis plant

256
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,278
and the beauty about having a living

257
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,320
mulch is i can find things that they

258
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,439
like more

259
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,560
than my cannabis plant like i explained

260
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,000
about the aphids

261
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,000
and then i can take the fight there

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,559
so deep in the flower or in the flower

263
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,078
in general i can't spray nothing

264
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,799
not that i would spray anything bad but

265
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,399
even compost teas and organic sprays

266
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,199
i can't even use because i'll fail the

267
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,919
microbial side of the test

268
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,879
so by having companion plants by having

269
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,199
a living mulch

270
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,480
what that allows me to do is it allows

271
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,440
me to find plants

272
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,360
that my pests like more than my cannabis

273
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,200
it allows me to take the fight

274
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,839
somewhere other than my cash crop so

275
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,360
i'll plant whether it's clover in a pot

276
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,720
i bust out the torch

277
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,399
or it's dichondra chickweed marigold

278
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160
whatever it is in my beds

279
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,919
that i can spray with the compost tea

280
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,480
when i can't spray my flowers

281
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,278
either way it takes a fight where i want

282
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,278
to take it

283
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:47,278
and it puts me in control so

284
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,039
those same problems that people have

285
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,759
found

286
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,120
again i have found ways to make those

287
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,200
solutions

288
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,959
and you have to be persistent you have

289
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,839
to mean it you have to have good

290
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,559
intentions

291
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,160
this isn't fakeable i mean it is on

292
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,919
instagram i'll be honest

293
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,838
but in real life when you're walking

294
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,439
people through this facility

295
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,880
they see it they feel it they can

296
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,680
breathe it they can smell it

297
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,439
the energy is in the air the product

298
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,559
speaks for itself

299
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,240
i run these rooms again with two

300
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,439
people two women so it can be done it's

301
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,200
just

302
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,880
are you willing to put in the work are

303
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,519
you willing to put the science to the

304
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,360
test

305
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,839
are you willing to have faith in mother

306
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,839
nature
