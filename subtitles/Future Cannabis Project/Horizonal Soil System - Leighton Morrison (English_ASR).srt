1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,960
tom you have any two by fours no

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,480
i've i've been look i've looked i don't

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,679
have a two by four i need

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,880
something to put in to what for just to

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,519
frame this off so that we can put that

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,118
tarp in

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:21,039
and the water will collect in the hole

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:23,600
will the smaller piece of wood frame

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,279
if we cut it uh oh leighton look what he

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,800
has

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,320
layton yeah yeah i mean that's better

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,320
than another other one actually

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,359
that's better than that i was using

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,399
obviously for steak

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:39,039
tom you can snap it with your muscular

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,239
arms that i could do this is kind of the

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,079
best i can do

18
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,439
yeah that'll work but it will frame it

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,960
in yep

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,359
and it's just it just can be right up

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,920
tight to the pot that's there

22
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,039
uh move the frame in yep tighter do you

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
want me to break these or leave them

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
holding well let's leave them whole and

25
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,398
we can

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,239
it doesn't matter so then what we'll do

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,759
is we'll put this one underneath

28
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,038
or do you want a lean look and then you

29
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,558
can just put that one up and over is

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,559
that that works okay that works fine

31
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,840
great

32
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,840
now that we see this

33
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,199
okay well you know what you're doing

34
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,040
okay

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
so you want to get all of this right and

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,080
you want to explain what you're doing

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,280
yeah pretty much that's the gist of it

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,280
this is what you're known for but you

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,439
haven't made a video yet

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,519
i introduced this to the cannabis

41
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,279
community four years ago in portland

42
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,438
maine and got a portland oregon and got

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,759
laughed off the stage

44
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,719
people thought i was fucking nuts they

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,879
thought

46
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,319
what do you know about growing cannabis

47
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,640
and i'm like dude

48
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,000
i'm a fucking soil engineer i know how

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,640
to build fucking soil

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,478
you guys your problem is you're using

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,478
this low tension soil

52
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,759
that goes hydrophobic on the top and

53
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,759
anaerobic who are you talking to

54
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,599
and then they laughed and they laughed

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,759
at you i was there

56
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:02,078
to introduce living soil concepts

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,599
to a bunch of growers who were all over

58
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,118
the map from

59
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,598
soil full sun indoor

60
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,719
i know that hydroponics the community

61
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,759
right it's all over the

62
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,318
map yeah so yeah basically you know they

63
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,598
were like

64
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,039
you know what the fuck do you know about

65
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,238
so what's happened in the intervening

66
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,120
four years

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,239
i've done a pose i did a podcast on

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,239
shaping fire about it

69
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,919
has anyone picked up the technique and

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,360
used it yeah i've done it

71
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:34,799
i've done you know 5 000 foot grows

72
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,560
6 000 foot grows big commercials big

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
commercial grows and then a shit ton of

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,759
little guys have called me

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,840
texted me to thank me out how well this

76
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,199
works but it took four fucking years

77
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,400
and no video and not not yet

78
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:52,399
not yet are we gonna fix that

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
uh tom do you want some of this sure

80
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:59,359
do you have a pipe of course i do have a

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,360
lighter i have a lighter and a pipe

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,719
and the match is over everton won one

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,920
nil oh really

84
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,479
yeah it's like good or bad been a great

85
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,598
now

86
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:14,560
you know we like everton i i do i mean

87
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,598
i do i do they're a good team oh you

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,000
have a lighter

89
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,079
i was like wait a second i know it was

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,639
later

91
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,640
okay mr leighton morrison

92
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,959
are you ready the stage is yours

93
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,679
what i'm suggesting for people is to

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,519
always use a mat underneath these pots

95
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
now the cool thing about these pots is

96
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,360
they have a vapor barrier which i've

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,919
always been telling people is critical

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,360
because you do not want moisture to

99
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,280
escape the pot

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,760
excess moisture you want to keep these

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,759
sides in the soil profiles

102
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,840
from drying out the top we're going to

103
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,239
deal with with a cover crop

104
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,680
but traditional smart pots that did not

105
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,080
have this liner

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,640
had major issues because they they the

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,439
size went hydrophobic which is when the

108
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,518
bacteria

109
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,560
cyst up and create a wax coating around

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,640
themselves

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,920
and it's a bitch to rehydrate so this is

112
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,438
a wonderful product

113
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,958
it's really happy that grassroots did

114
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,878
this and so what we're going to do today

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,160
and this is a 30 gallon yep this is a 30

116
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,680
gallon and so

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,560
if you notice there is a band at the

118
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,360
bottom

119
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,918
that will allow moisture to go through

120
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,120
which is ideal for this system

121
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:33,680
because again we have that aquifer

122
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,040
on the bottom that is designed to allow

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,918
you oh i didn't know you set the other

124
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,479
one up which is designed

125
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,719
to allow excess moisture to escape and

126
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,719
be stored in the profile

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,160
but it's ideal if you can see when

128
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,000
you're watering

129
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,280
if you're over watering the excess is

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
going to come out and build up in the

131
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,039
map below

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,360
so it's kind of a safety mechanism if

133
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,439
you

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,040
don't have or if you have pots that are

135
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,879
lined all the way down the side

136
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,160
right you'll see versus have it being

137
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,680
oblivious to it right

138
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,280
and and this is ideal because it's

139
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,120
really going to teach you how to water

140
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,758
with this new system

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
so it's it's a win-win for you guys and

142
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
you know again you'll be able to see

143
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,240
excess moisture

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,319
if you have any otherwise it will be

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,560
stored in that system and wick it right

146
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:20,240
back up again as it needs it

147
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,879
so the first step in this is to

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,720
lay out the horizons so it's kind of

149
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,959
pretty much brainless that

150
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,479
the lowest horizon is going to be right

151
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,399
to this

152
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,599
top of the fabric which is about two and

153
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,959
a half inches

154
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
or a little bit less two and a quarter

155
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,478
inches depending on where i measure from

156
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,639
so that's perfect so our e horizon is

157
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,319
going to go right up to the edge of this

158
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,680
which is ideal and then the rest of

159
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,959
these measurements

160
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,519
are going to be to give us a general

161
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:52,239
idea of where we're supposed to be

162
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,799
which is five inches so i'm going to hit

163
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,400
that at a couple points around it

164
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,120
so now you're in increments of five

165
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,758
inches well the the concept is the

166
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,680
a the e horizon which is the s the

167
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,720
starting point

168
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,560
is one unit of measurement and then from

169
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,039
there on out

170
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,240
each unit is going to incrementally

171
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,560
increase

172
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,319
so the first unit is two and a half the

173
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,560
second unit is five

174
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,000
the last one will be about ten inches or

175
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,879
a little bit less because these pots

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,959
aren't quite

177
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,079
from the previous mark right so think

178
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,719
about it as e

179
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,478
is is two and a half so times two yeah

180
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,520
would be your a horizon

181
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,519
times four would be your o horizon so

182
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,000
four times the depth

183
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,159
of the e horizon and that can be done in

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,759
any any dimension so if you're 36 inch

185
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,680
deep 24 inch deep

186
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:47,120
just use those increments e is one

187
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,519
a is two o is four

188
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,399
so it's pretty simple so i'm just going

189
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,879
to measure finish

190
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,439
marking these and is there a bare

191
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,000
minimum

192
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,759
for the e or like it like well i mean if

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,598
you're getting into a pot that's only 12

194
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,879
inches tall

195
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,159
then you know it's kind of silly to try

196
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,279
to do all this

197
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,560
um although i did it for my girls house

198
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,198
plants

199
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,000
and man did they take off so but like is

200
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
there a minimum

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,839
pot size below which you'd be like just

202
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,918
yeah you know

203
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,679
six inch maybe you know something that's

204
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,519
just so small that you can

205
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,800
your your e horizon would be minuscule

206
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,639
i would just do a model like would you

207
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,560
bother with this in like three or five

208
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,319
gallon pots

209
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,000
or just if i was transplanting no

210
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,439
so if i was transplanting out of that

211
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,879
absolutely not i wouldn't waste the time

212
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,000
i would just use the l horizon because

213
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,120
you're going to be transporting

214
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,279
transplanting them

215
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,240
into no horizon so why even bother with

216
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,159
the a

217
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,560
because if it's a temporary pot what's

218
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,560
the point you know this is a lot of work

219
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,240
and it becomes heavy so you don't want

220
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,879
to be dealing with that excess weight

221
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
and and

222
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,000
you know in a transplant situation

223
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,000
everything's going to get all mixed up

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,519
right so

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,360
we have our units of dimension and

226
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,359
we're going to start with gravel

227
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,720
so this is gravel that i got at a local

228
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,919
gravel pit

229
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,160
i know there are different types of

230
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,878
gravel yes you want to make sure it's

231
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,639
jagged

232
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,720
yeah what about color

233
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,918
color is great the more different colors

234
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,080
you can get

235
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,758
indicate different minerals okay so

236
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,959
having like a mix of dark and light

237
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,120
color would be totally fine

238
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,399
yep absolutely and no matter what size

239
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,560
pot you start with

240
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,440
this is the size of the gravel pieces

241
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,918
you want to use

242
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,719
um in deeper beds i will do what's

243
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,559
called a

244
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:45,519
2 or three inch minus so that's rock

245
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,000
that has been ground up with a machine

246
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,120
so it's all jagged but they sift it

247
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,958
through a screen

248
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,799
two inch three inch four inch depending

249
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,319
on what you want but you get all the

250
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,000
fines with it right

251
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,240
what are these this is just a

252
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,759
three-quarter gravel

253
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,720
so then i'm going to add in

254
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,720
some sands

255
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:13,039
so i have two different types of sand

256
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,040
either before you dump it in

257
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:21,200
so that's a coarse sand and again it has

258
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,320
quite a bit different colors in it

259
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,839
sizes so this one see how it's a little

260
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,000
fine for my liking

261
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,959
but again it's not going to be a problem

262
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,480
as long as it's not

263
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,518
white it's like right now it's like

264
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,519
kitty litter sand

265
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,879
so that you know this is like beach set

266
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,399
did you actually get this from

267
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,958
no i just got it from the dunes behind

268
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,480
my house oh cool but again it's not

269
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,319
white powder

270
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,560
it's not white powdery it's not it's

271
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,200
fine but it's not super fine you do not

272
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,039
want the

273
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,560
you don't want that powdery stuff

274
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,759
because that will plug up you don't want

275
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,199
like the caribbean

276
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,720
uh fluff right yeah so

277
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,320
you know really fine beach sand is not

278
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,399
ideal but you can use

279
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,320
actually la sands great i mean it sucks

280
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,120
as beach sand but uh it's coarse

281
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,640
it's good for this it's ideal where i am

282
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,240
at our beach

283
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,159
no i have to go out there after wind

284
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,000
storms after santa ana's

285
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,000
because that blows all day oh and oxnard

286
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,639
it is fine yeah we have super fine

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,799
sandwich i wish we had that

288
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,078
so all right so bottom line is we have

289
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,078
our base mixes

290
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:33,439
and i'm going to kind of homogeneously

291
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:37,120
blend them together here

292
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,120
this this pots not going to blow over

293
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,919
so we have our sandbag as the bottom

294
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,039
layer

295
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:47,838
trying to get rid of any excess organic

296
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,838
matter

297
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,000
layton destroyed a whole sand dunes

298
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,799
ecosystem hey

299
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,039
this was in a vacant lot man they just

300
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,439
bought the lot so it's gonna get trashed

301
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,919
great who's that asshole ripping up the

302
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
grass

303
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,039
so basically the coarse and the not fine

304
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,160
but less coarse you're just gonna mix

305
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,679
them together right

306
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,759
and what are you looking to achieve

307
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:20,000
again you're just adding a layer in

308
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,799
right and again you know if you're

309
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,639
limited to the sands that you have

310
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,559
just use what you have i mean like i

311
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,480
know guys that are

312
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,679
don't have access to these types of sand

313
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,039
so they just go to

314
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:35,599
a masonry supply yard and they purchase

315
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,039
coarse masonry sand so if you're going

316
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,399
to do that

317
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,278
you want to be looking for tan brown

318
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,039
gray

319
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:48,000
not white not fine but like colored

320
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,519
sands that will indicate diverse

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,759
nutrients

322
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,600
in calcium carbonate or just silica

323
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,159
so again you're going to get a good mix

324
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,720
of organic nutrients at the bottom of

325
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,399
the pot

326
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,120
what is the purpose of this layer of

327
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,559
sand this is called an aquifer

328
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,560
good question so if you think about way

329
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,518
nature stores water

330
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,799
she does not let organic matter get in

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,879
and the biggest problem

332
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,879
that we have is that when we put organic

333
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:20,159
matter on top of this

334
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,000
if we don't have a sand filter then the

335
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,278
fines can get down in there and then

336
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
eventually go anaerobic

337
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,078
but the roots will be growing through

338
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,799
the roots will go down and create

339
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,399
channels

340
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,000
and then they will die off and the

341
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,480
biology will eat it

342
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,159
but it won't be like fines like organic

343
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,200
fines are a real problem that's when you

344
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,719
see

345
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,480
what's called a black layer in the soil

346
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
so i do a lot of testing right so i go

347
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,399
out to soil sites and i dig pits

348
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,240
and i look down and i can see where the

349
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,000
plow pan is because it's a black layer

350
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,959
of anaerobic organisms

351
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,078
so is that just super compact yeah yeah

352
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,278
and what happens is

353
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,879
over time the fines migrate and they hit

354
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:57,200
that compaction layer and they can't go

355
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,399
anywhere

356
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:04,480
say the plow pan it's called plow pan

357
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,799
or or it depends on where you are in the

358
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,480
country there's other it's it plow pan

359
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,719
or hard pan or anaerobic layer

360
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,600
it's the depth at which the plows can no

361
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,839
longer reach

362
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
here in oxnard they have deep rippers or

363
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,399
uh

364
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,480
chisel plows that go down about two and

365
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,919
a half feet three feet for what perp

366
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,079
like froze because what they're doing

367
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,000
yeah the strawberries

368
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,078
you may need to go down three or four

369
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,278
you can't oh the equipment came but when

370
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:30,799
you're looking at the soil

371
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,879
oh yeah when i'm looking at soil i use a

372
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,399
backhoe or or an excavator so i can dig

373
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,480
as deep as i want

374
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,000
but often i'll see these layers and then

375
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,000
i go okay

376
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,679
now i know whether i got to build on top

377
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,159
of that soil

378
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,039
or raise it up a little bit or whether i

379
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,120
can

380
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,879
remediate it depending on how bad that

381
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,679
plow paint what do you mean build up you

382
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,240
mean like

383
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,239
bugle yeah right up on top of the soil

384
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,959
like a lot of guys call me about hey i'm

385
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,320
in north

386
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,838
norcal i got you know this clay soil

387
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,920
that will not drain

388
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,199
so up you go don't even mess with

389
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,000
digging a hole as soon as you dig that

390
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:05,838
hole

391
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,078
all the water's going to go there and

392
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,519
it's going to create an anaerobic soup

393
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,198
and kill your plants doesn't it is that

394
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,560
going to happen anyway you know when you

395
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,198
build on top of that no it's just going

396
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,759
to hit that

397
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,679
hit that top soil and drain off okay

398
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,078
because that hole is like a swimming

399
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,919
pool

400
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,039
surrounded by hard stuff so any water

401
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,278
that gets that low

402
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,480
is going to go into that hole yeah

403
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,559
impermeable soil

404
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,000
so you're creating a swamp when the

405
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,919
roots eventually make it down

406
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,198
into that area you said they die off or

407
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,679
they're living and getting

408
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,359
minerals they'll live until the plant

409
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,198
dies oh right right and then they'll

410
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,959
decompose then they'll decompose

411
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,879
but again it won't be fines because the

412
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,000
biology around the rio sphere of the

413
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,958
root will eat that up

414
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
and consume it's also disproportionately

415
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,719
more

416
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,720
rock mass than roots right absolutely

417
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,959
and again i'm not concerned about it you

418
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,360
know on on the long term

419
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,919
tom that is service is that a

420
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,039
grapefruits

421
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,198
no i'm good right now but i'll

422
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,719
definitely hit that up later

423
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,120
all right so now that we've got our when

424
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,560
we get really crazy we'll crack open the

425
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,560
the flavored seltzer water

426
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,880
now that we have our e horizon in place

427
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,439
it's important to

428
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,919
what kind of crazy gizmos uh you just

429
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,000
hit

430
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:28,958
don't aim it at me though there you go

431
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,278
there we go so we just want to water

432
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,239
this

433
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,240
in yeah

434
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,839
we should see a little excess water

435
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,839
coming out the sides

436
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,600
give it a couple minutes for it to start

437
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,879
for me to see it coming up oh yeah yeah

438
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,879
now you can see it changing color

439
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,198
you don't have to get too crazy but i'm

440
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,198
sorry i'm going to do this

441
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,639
take the time to do it right just make

442
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,278
sure that

443
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,480
there are no voids because if we have a

444
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,399
void

445
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,399
then our sand filter is no longer

446
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,519
functionally functioning properly

447
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,440
what are you looking for well i'm

448
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,919
packing it by doing this it's like

449
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,040
it's a void would be like a bubble or

450
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,159
yeah any pocket

451
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,879
pocket that was allow those fines to get

452
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,559
down in there

453
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,799
which is the whole purpose of this

454
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,399
filter is to prevent that all right so

455
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,719
this is to keep all the

456
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,240
the soil stuff from getting down into

457
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,360
the rock

458
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,720
the rocks home do we have any excess

459
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,399
moisture

460
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,839
no but the edge of the pot is black do

461
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,720
you like the height of it it seems

462
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,680
perfect yeah

463
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,959
yeah leighton so far are you happy with

464
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,758
the work you've done

465
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,599
yeah yeah and i think this is great

466
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,560
because this is the horizon that's most

467
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,320
important

468
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,000
i mean if you screw up your a horizon a

469
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,879
little bit it's not going to be an issue

470
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,679
if your clay to silt to sand ratio are

471
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,000
off

472
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,479
no stress but here this one is the most

473
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,360
important because if you screw up this

474
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,159
you're going to have nothing but

475
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,600
problems all the way down yep

476
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,519
so i think we're in good shape here that

477
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,838
looks nice and settled smooth

478
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,038
i don't see any issues with pockets

479
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,480
starting to see some moisture come

480
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,599
through the sides so it's not

481
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,120
excess moisture but we did do accomplish

482
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,879
the goal which was to make sure that we

483
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,198
got this nice and

484
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,760
nice and moist so that it completely

485
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,079
collapsed on itself

486
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,199
so now we're gonna move into making and

487
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:29,678
so we did uh

488
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,440
just to recap how many inches of rock

489
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,038
about two and a quarter inches this is a

490
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
total of two and a quarter so then you

491
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:34,879
do

492
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,439
four and a half of six i'm gonna i'm

493
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,400
gonna go five of a horizon the sand and

494
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,360
the gravel are the e

495
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,840
horizon sorry the rock layer at the

496
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,439
bottom

497
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,678
the rock is just two and a quarter

498
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,240
inches yeah well whatever layer

499
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,798
that whole layer we just put in is two

500
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,079
and a quarter

501
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:54,558
oh rock plus sand correct but is there a

502
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,279
is there's a ratio between rock descent

503
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:57,678
no no

504
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,119
the the ratio rock to sand like if i had

505
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,240
a little bit more rock i would have put

506
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,719
that in there as well

507
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,839
ah okay i just didn't bring enough i i

508
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,839
should have brought another bucket now

509
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,879
also is the idea that at this point now

510
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,159
the sand has

511
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,360
filled in all the voids right within the

512
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,759
rock right so if if you're using

513
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,558
rock two the two and a quarter two and a

514
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,400
half inch

515
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,879
depth you're gonna have a bigger

516
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,798
challenge of getting that sand to work

517
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,640
all the way into the bottom in between

518
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,400
and get a little muddy because only when

519
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,960
it's in that state that's right we fill

520
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,720
everything

521
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,000
fill all the voids so do you want the

522
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,000
sand to like

523
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,160
the rock was laid down first with air

524
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,599
pockets so do you want the sand to fill

525
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,600
in all those air pockets

526
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,359
okay all right you know that's why i

527
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,519
love the products like the two

528
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,639
or two and a half or three or four inch

529
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,000
minus

530
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,559
because you're getting all of that

531
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,759
broken you know stone dust rock dust

532
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,759
mixed with it

533
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,119
but again i'm still going to put sand on

534
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,960
top of that layer

535
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,399
just to make sure everything gets washed

536
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,038
down into the pockets

537
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,480
but the taller the rock layer the more

538
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,000
challenging it is to get

539
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,519
all of those voids way down at the

540
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,880
bottom of that rock layer to fill with

541
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,400
sand that's when it's really important

542
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,320
that you water the hell out of it

543
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,480
yeah until you know that there's enough

544
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,558
there's no voids in there right

545
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,079
so and in case some cases i'll even take

546
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:12,399
a hoe and just kind of hoe it a little

547
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,159
bit

548
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,480
so if you had a raised bed that was like

549
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,080
this high your sand rock

550
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,558
layer is going to be proportionately

551
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:23,038
probably six inches but your the size of

552
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,639
your gravel pieces will still be

553
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,798
like no larger you're not going to use

554
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,759
larger gravel pieces are you

555
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,440
yes the largest gravel piece you'll use

556
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:31,839
well it'll depend on the depth of the

557
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,400
bed

558
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,199
okay so what's the biggest depth bed uv

559
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,320
uh

560
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,200
36 inches so it was about an eight inch

561
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:43,038
horizon the e horizon so in that case we

562
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,720
didn't go we i think we ended up using

563
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,400
three inch mines

564
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,079
in that application i wouldn't use

565
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
monster boulders because you're just

566
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,480
complicating yourself

567
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,960
you're making it more difficult on

568
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,798
yourself so we have this layer which is

569
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,880
almost like a layer of cement at the

570
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,359
bottom but it's it's breathable cement

571
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,360
right

572
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,798
call it a sand filter yes cement's not

573
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,879
in it like google google

574
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,639
sand filter people sand filters are used

575
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,000
in all different types of applications

576
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,200
from golf courses to

577
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,519
aquaculture yeah it's for filtering out

578
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,960
fines and we're doing we're again

579
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,200
biomimicking

580
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,400
existing built your very first sand

581
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,400
filter well

582
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,320
sounds like the sand is like of the two

583
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,240
components the actual

584
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,599
the critical the critical one yes and

585
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,159
the rock

586
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,359
is for the mycorrhizae all right because

587
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,520
we're going to have fungus that's

588
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,279
getting down into those rocks and mining

589
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,918
materials and feeding them back up to

590
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,599
the plants

591
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,520
i know eventually would break down but

592
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,079
what would happen if you use like wood

593
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,639
chips

594
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,678
at the bottom yeah turn the mud okay and

595
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,919
then you'd have a swamp

596
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,600
right the whole goal is to prevent that

597
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,679
layer from ever becoming a swamp

598
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,199
okay which is why it's a sample and then

599
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,798
you can do whatever you want above it

600
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,679
right right essentially i mean you could

601
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:54,558
just throw on just super soil right now

602
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,320
but the the key is the next layer is

603
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,279
going to be like the heart and lungs for

604
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,038
the soil system

605
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,279
so it's going to help to pull that

606
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,440
moisture out of the e horizon

607
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,200
and wick it back up into the over well

608
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,720
let's get on to it

609
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,558
all right so next we're actually going

610
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,480
to skip making the

611
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,079
a horizon and we're going to go right

612
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,599
into the e horizon

613
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,359
and the reason we're doing this is

614
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,839
because our a horizon has

615
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,879
20 percent organic matter in it and

616
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,119
that's the same

617
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,280
as the o horizon so we're going to use

618
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,359
some of the o horizon to mix into our a

619
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,000
horizon sorry oh horizon is the top

620
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:31,439
horizon

621
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,440
okay yep so it's e-a-o e-o-e-o-e

622
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,200
think about the abbreviation e stands

623
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,720
for alluvial

624
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,000
o stands for organic layer

625
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,919
a is is just a it's a

626
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,599
if there's no there's no classification

627
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,038
for that name um

628
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:56,480
it goes a b c bedrock

629
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,240
uh and or e horizon depending on where

630
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,919
you are in the world as

631
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,279
and that's you know that's soil science

632
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,799
i didn't come up with this isn't your

633
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,240
cat's name alluvial

634
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:08,319
no that's a good cat name

635
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,759
all right let me get my my next child

636
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,079
alluvial

637
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,599
is that the correct pronunciation yeah

638
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,359
all right

639
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,279
alluvial layers are really i'm going to

640
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,199
weave that into a conversation in the

641
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:22,319
next day

642
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,000
alluvial is really cool because it

643
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,279
really should be broken up into

644
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,480
multiple horizons or multiple

645
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:33,519
zones because it actually goes from

646
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,558
inside down in the water a few feet to

647
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,000
up on the land

648
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:41,279
by a few hundred yards depending on

649
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,319
the plant species so it's kind of one of

650
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,000
those

651
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,918
zones that really should be broken up

652
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,200
into multiple zones you shouldn't count

653
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,200
what's under water

654
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,279
with what's above water just because the

655
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,240
plants there dictate that that's a wet

656
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:54,158
soil

657
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,159
but again you know i'm not here to bash

658
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,960
the way soil systems are

659
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,720
set up other than i hate the dog we'll

660
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,798
be a little snarky about it though

661
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,038
yeah i mean okay leighton where's the

662
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:08,240
camera

663
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,279
other than the fact that i strongly

664
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,480
dispute

665
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,079
the way soil science classifies sansil

666
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,319
and clay

667
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,199
based on their particulate size not

668
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,519
based on

669
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,360
specific gravity whether they're

670
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,519
magnetically charged or not

671
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,359
and where they're formed silt does not

672
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,558
come from rock silk comes from organic

673
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,798
matter

674
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,359
okay sand comes it would break down

675
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:34,319
right and it does

676
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,199
uh sand comes from rock and clay come

677
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,158
from rock

678
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,080
but that clay is formed through glaciers

679
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,240
or volcanoes

680
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,199
sand can come from the ocean ancient

681
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,880
coral beds

682
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,080
or shellfish beds or it can come

683
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,720
from just broken down rock broken down

684
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,240
mineral

685
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
so clay has a magnetic charge sand does

686
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,038
not

687
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,798
silt has a negative charge clay actually

688
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,879
has a positive and negative charge

689
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,119
silt has just a negative charge sand has

690
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,039
no charge so why do we call these

691
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,879
different things based on sieve size

692
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,640
based on their particle size

693
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,799
you know that's dogma that needs to be

694
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,038
changed but that's my only bitch with

695
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,960
soil science

696
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,200
so the way you describe that in plain

697
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,120
english makes total sense so like why do

698
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,519
other soil scientists have such a

699
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,439
difficult time being like

700
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,038
that makes because because they were

701
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,440
taught through university

702
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,200
college and traditional educational

703
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,440
dogma that has not been changed for

704
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,960
hundreds of years you know it's kind of

705
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,720
like we treat cancer

706
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,480
we treat cancer the same way we have for

707
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,480
50 years

708
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,000
where's the improvement people come on

709
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,159
man that's ridiculous

710
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,519
so you're saying that the the plants are

711
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,278
interacting with the

712
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,519
different charges not with the

713
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:48,960
particulates oh there's so much going on

714
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,720
with the charges now we're getting into

715
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,919
anions and cat ions and that's

716
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,960
why i didn't really mean to open up a

717
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,080
can of worms here

718
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,400
yeah yeah you did i'm sure everyone

719
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,439
watching will

720
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,440
appreciate a little knowledge drop so

721
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,798
now we got

722
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:14,080
all of our different ingredients

723
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:16,798
for this is basically like mulch

724
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,678
right yeah that's chips that's chips

725
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:19,679
yeah

726
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,120
that are aged for at least a year and a

727
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,200
half um if you

728
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,319
if you if you do not have aged chips

729
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,240
don't use them

730
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,079
they will steal nitrogen from your soil

731
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,278
system okay so it's almost like they've

732
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,480
been buffered

733
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,440
yeah yeah um this is some fine screen

734
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,599
compost

735
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,798
that i made um it's gonna have lots of

736
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,359
earthworms at the house

737
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,319
yeah fuck yeah um i actually make my

738
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,000
product with this stuff

739
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,759
and i microscope it and i know that

740
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,278
shit's killer

741
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,038
um here we have look at that little

742
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,558
roly-poly yeah you got everything in

743
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:50,000
here oh my gosh

744
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,278
you'll have millipedes you'll have

745
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,839
nematodes you'll have earthworms

746
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,038
all kinds of goodies there's your little

747
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:58,558
roly-poly

748
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,640
set it free remember when gemma was

749
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,839
setting the rolly pulleys for you

750
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,679
um here we have some aggro coco from a

751
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,759
company here in la that i highly

752
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,559
recommend they are you can purchase this

753
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,158
nationally cocoa that's the name of the

754
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,079
company okay can you say what each one

755
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,640
of these adds to the mix

756
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,439
what it's providing uh it's providing

757
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,559
the

758
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,880
what i would consider a diverse

759
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:26,798
group of organic matter components

760
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,799
so again diversity is key the more

761
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,879
diverse things we have the better

762
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,879
this is high in potassium the potassium

763
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,960
is locked up so will not affect your

764
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,679
saturated paste test

765
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,278
incredible water holding capacity again

766
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,400
agrococo does something

767
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:45,119
no other cocoa company does which is

768
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,240
they compress their product to only 2.2

769
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,319
pounds

770
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,558
the ones in the far east compress to 10

771
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,480
pounds what is it so they destroy

772
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,000
yeah it destroys the water holding

773
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,360
capacity of them you're talking about

774
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,278
when they ship it as bricks

775
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:58,879
yes yeah no those company yeah it's

776
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,798
insane and and worse

777
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,559
their their cocoa comes from what's

778
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,759
called brackish water

779
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,519
so it's high and high in chlorine i'd

780
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,038
like to drink some brackish yeah it's

781
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,679
high in chloride

782
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,640
and high in sodium and also the way they

783
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,480
handle it

784
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,919
they're running equipment all over it

785
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,839
they're doing it on a scale where

786
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,320
they're spilling hydraulic fluid and all

787
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,240
kinds of contaminants all over the stuff

788
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,079
then they press it it'd be like it's

789
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,480
like if tom's mustang we're leaking oil

790
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,720
uh

791
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,960
all over our soil tom was driving all

792
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,880
over the cocoa coir

793
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,960
um here we have a little pit moss

794
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,200
growers grade you've heard me talk about

795
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,759
i

796
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,798
i haven't i have a pit moss question

797
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,519
later but yes i

798
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,319
am anti-peat there's only three percent

799
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:42,798
of the world's

800
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,558
surface is covered with peat bogs they

801
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,000
are incredibly important as far as

802
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,000
filting water

803
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,919
for all of our aquifers and drinking

804
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,398
water rivers and streams

805
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,440
so to destroy them to harvest a product

806
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,558
is is

807
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,960
lunacy to say the least and and again

808
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:59,599
it's

809
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,278
it's its own diverse ecosystem that

810
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,558
cannot be built it took millions of

811
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,000
years to build it

812
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:05,918
and we're never going to see those again

813
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,558
as long as we continue to mine them

814
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,399
so stop using pete please and then here

815
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:13,839
i have a little bit of

816
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:15,599
what's called steer compost so it has a

817
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:18,000
little bit of cow manure in it

818
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,918
um it's been pasteurized so that by weed

819
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,440
free it means like seeds and like shit

820
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,480
that'll sprout up not uh

821
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,600
no it's anti-cannabis i'm sorry but we

822
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,038
gotta let everybody play

823
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,319
nice in the box all right so

824
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,038
that's essentially and this is going to

825
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:34,798
be straw for the top layer

826
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,879
it's just again a mulching in so that

827
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,720
our soil doesn't dry out

828
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,320
uh until we start getting plants in it

829
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,360
and hopefully we'll get some cover crop

830
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,480
seeds going in that

831
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,918
soon yeah after we build it

832
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,919
well i was going to bring i was bringing

833
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,520
some of the daikon over but uh um

834
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,640
there's a there's a lot of different

835
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,398
ones i like i like

836
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,480
the creeping lavender um

837
00:28:54,398 --> 00:29:00,398
you know vatch is cool clover be careful

838
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,399
because it can be a pest attractor

839
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,679
so you know again do your homework

840
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,558
i recommend again all about diversity

841
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,159
diversity diversity diversity and then

842
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,599
pay attention to what's grows

843
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,278
and if it doesn't grow there if it

844
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:16,000
doesn't like your situation don't do it

845
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:17,759
again

846
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,079
pick something else but you know play

847
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,158
with it there's no reason not to do

848
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,398
a thousand cover crop species and see

849
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,240
which one grows which one doesn't

850
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,079
it's all just food it's all fodder for

851
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,038
the system to feed the biology

852
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,319
so don't be afraid to experiment but

853
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,158
learn your lesson

854
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,158
if it didn't work the first time don't

855
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,399
repeat are there any that a lot of

856
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:42,080
people use that you like to avoid

857
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,158
they're they're ones that grow up and i

858
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,038
consider too fast for the plant to keep

859
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,120
up with

860
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,759
so again you want low-lying creeping

861
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,879
plants um

862
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,558
there's lavender dichondra's another one

863
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,000
there's a few different creepers that i

864
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,319
really love

865
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,558
and you got to look at the cover crop in

866
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,398
the way that it's preventing the surface

867
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:04,000
of the soil from drying out whether it's

868
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,000
from wind or sun

869
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
it's creating a micro climate right at

870
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,079
the soil surface which is ideal for

871
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,278
biology and for earthworms for early

872
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,158
pulleys

873
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,038
and all of that so it and then better

874
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,240
yet

875
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:20,398
it's growing miles of ryosphere which is

876
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,399
the organisms that we want to be doing

877
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,398
our work our nutrient cycling

878
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,398
and you're doing it for free and if you

879
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,239
do get mycorrhizae which i suggest you

880
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,479
do with this style system

881
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,640
because it can mine material it has the

882
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,919
things it needs

883
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,440
it will connect with all of your

884
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,000
different cover crops and share

885
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,840
nutrients

886
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,398
all throughout the whole system they all

887
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:43,759
work in conjunction

888
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:47,278
so based on our dimension here i got to

889
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:51,599
assume that's going to be about

890
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:53,839
two buckets times

891
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,038
four so what's your calculation so that

892
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,359
someone can uh

893
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,480
well what i did was i figured out what i

894
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,240
used at the bottom

895
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:07,679
was was three quarters three quarters

896
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:11,278
three quarters half so i used about

897
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,600
um two buckets

898
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,119
on the on the bottom layer so i'm going

899
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:16,240
to assume

900
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,398
that i'm going to use about eight

901
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:24,000
buckets on the top layer

902
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:24,000
so we got four to one a bucket of this

903
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:35,759
we got a bucket of this

904
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,760
a bucket of this

905
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:47,840
now i need an empty bucket

906
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:55,519
and you know again you don't have to get

907
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,039
too anal with this

908
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:02,240
nature isn't perfect and to air is

909
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:15,839
only human so now we're up to

910
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:15,839
four buckets

911
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,599
that'll be five buckets and if you

912
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,839
notice i'm not putting them all in at

913
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,839
once

914
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:43,839
kind of just layering them together here

915
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:10,720
now shovels shovels right here

916
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:12,798
here you go my loyal assistant

917
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,720
wow it's so interesting because it

918
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,038
always seems like uh

919
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,839
it's more than you're gonna need well

920
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,440
it's always good

921
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,759
it's it's always good to mix up a little

922
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,759
extra

923
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:27,278
try to go all the way down to the bottom

924
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,038
get that core flipping around

925
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,359
i mean whatever we don't use we're gonna

926
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:31,359
store

927
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:39,359
now ideally i like to use a cement mixer

928
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,558
for this

929
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,719
because it will mix everything

930
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:45,759
homogenously yeah

931
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,880
but unfortunately it's not worthy for

932
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,200
this little project

933
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,159
i'm also putting that in your uh truck

934
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,519
i'm not we're not worthy

935
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,320
well maybe worthy was a bad word to be

936
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,319
a choice of words

937
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,519
no but the mixer just like in your

938
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,960
kitchen probably

939
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,519
gets it like totally grounded so did you

940
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,800
just go

941
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:20,000
rogue on the one bucket of each concept

942
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,760
yes okay what did you notice that made

943
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,559
you decide you wanted to dump a bunch of

944
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,679
uh

945
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:29,440
the more pitmas in

946
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,679
because we were only at six buckets

947
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,800
yeah and i'm estimating eight but i

948
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,838
probably am wrong

949
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,839
got it

950
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,519
i think i'm probably going to end up

951
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,519
needing six total but

952
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:48,480
we shall see as you're gonna put more of

953
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:51,838
everything in got it got it well no i've

954
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,838
used up everything that i had

955
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,358
but point being it doesn't matter that

956
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,880
you are disproportionately a little more

957
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,559
pissed yeah again it's you know

958
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,000
a lot of guys just use uh one-third

959
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:08,320
core one-third um rice holes

960
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,519
one-third pet moss no peat moss people

961
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,720
people

962
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,719
please people i should say

963
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,440
well no if you do that it's not gonna it

964
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,119
won't mix no we just gotta keep

965
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,159
we can grab all the corners and keep

966
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,160
throwing it up in the air

967
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:44,560
i mean it's pretty homogeneous now it's

968
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:46,559
not too bad

969
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,559
what do you think peter it looks pretty

970
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,279
homogenous

971
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,279
what do you think

972
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,559
smells like heaven so but what do you

973
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,838
think

974
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,719
right that smell says it all that sounds

975
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:02,239
like dover

976
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,118
it smells like the woods right when you

977
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:08,479
dig go out in the woods and step on it

978
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,039
so it's dry it's it's moist a little

979
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,639
moist

980
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:15,199
a little bit yeah so again you know

981
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:17,598
when you're mixing wet ingredients

982
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,439
especially for your a horizon

983
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,880
you have to dry them out because if you

984
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,559
don't dry them out

985
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,680
they're going to be all clumpy and so

986
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,239
therefore you're never going to get

987
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:26,960
homogeneous

988
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,118
homogeneously mixed and again that's why

989
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,838
i like to use a cement mixer

990
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,000
especially for the uh a horizon because

991
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,199
that one's hard well especially

992
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,358
especially if you're doing bigger

993
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,118
projects i mean this is a 130 gallon

994
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:41,679
bucket but if you're

995
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,280
if you were filling like 30 4x4 raised

996
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,480
beds oh if i'm doing that that's a

997
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,160
commercial blend

998
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,159
so i work with companies all over the

999
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:51,358
country that blend

1000
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:54,559
for high performance sports fields

1001
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,719
golf courses shit like that and the key

1002
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,159
to that is though is knowing your inputs

1003
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,480
so a lot of these golf courses won't

1004
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,000
have all or these

1005
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,519
soil blenders will not have all the

1006
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,519
components you want

1007
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:06,960
so you have to go out and speak to local

1008
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,199
people

1009
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,720
fine sources for the silt and the clay

1010
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,319
maybe

1011
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:15,118
and then have it trucked in and then

1012
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,640
blended so it's a little bit of a job

1013
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,720
plus when i'm doing a job like that i

1014
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:21,279
test every component

1015
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,239
and i'm an anal like crazy about making

1016
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,839
sure that

1017
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:28,719
what i saw what i grabbed what i tested

1018
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:30,480
is what ended up in the in in the mix

1019
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:31,039
you can't be lazy about this shit people

1020
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,599
because

1021
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,519
man the guys at these blending places

1022
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,079
they don't give a flying fuck about you

1023
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,599
so you have to do the homework you have

1024
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,039
to do your due diligence

1025
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,800
or you're going to get fucked bottom

1026
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,960
line so

1027
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,079
don't count on anybody to do their job

1028
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,400
count on yourself

1029
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,599
especially not at scale right especially

1030
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,559
at scale

1031
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,559
that's when you get killed

1032
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:59,919
all right so now we're going to wrap

1033
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:01,359
this up and pull it off to the side

1034
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,960
actually let's pull it into the sun and

1035
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,319
blend in the shade

1036
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,079
let's get smart about this it's hot as

1037
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,039
hell out here

1038
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,640
in la i'm a new england boy my blood's a

1039
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,519
little thick

1040
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,078
do you have another tarp i do can we

1041
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,358
grab it

1042
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:22,000
sure time you want to hold this one sure

1043
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:22,639
let me find my keys ah but it's nice and

1044
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,920
cool

1045
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:27,598
it is you know that's what i love about

1046
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,680
southern california if you're too hot

1047
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,480
you just go into shade that's gorgeous

1048
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:36,159
all right so lay it in freestyle on uh

1049
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,159
cations and anions

1050
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:40,889
[Music]

1051
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:48,480
cat ions and anions are

1052
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,039
sites in the soil that attract nutrients

1053
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,480
of the opposite charge

1054
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:57,759
so a cation is negatively charged

1055
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,440
like a clay platelet and around the

1056
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,359
outside of that clay platelet looks like

1057
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:06,720
a flying saucer

1058
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:09,598
is 100 sites in those 100 sites

1059
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,239
we want to attract 75 parts of those

1060
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,599
should be

1061
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:16,559
calcium 17 of those

1062
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,079
should be magnesium and eight of those

1063
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,960
should be potassium

1064
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,079
if i see that in a saturated paste test

1065
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,760
i know that the

1066
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,400
basic soil health is in good shape

1067
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,440
for me to go ahead and plant the next

1068
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,519
thing i look at

1069
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:37,039
is your micronutrients

1070
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:40,079
those are key to different

1071
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,719
critical plant functions

1072
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,440
i did a conference called

1073
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:45,838
learnlivingsoils.com

1074
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,639
chip and i got into this pretty deep so

1075
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,759
if you

1076
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,759
want to you can still purchase replays

1077
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,599
and watch that section specifically so

1078
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,880
you better understand

1079
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:00,320
how these nutrients affect

1080
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:04,480
the plants physiology

1081
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,838
so then now we get into anions and ions

1082
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,719
are positively charged

1083
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:10,559
soil particles that attract negatively

1084
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:12,959
charged nutrients

1085
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,759
so again when you have a soil test you

1086
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,280
you will see

1087
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,280
your percentage of cec which is cation

1088
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,760
exchange capacity

1089
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,640
they will often do an anion report as

1090
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,640
well

1091
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,759
but you really want to be focused more

1092
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,799
on the cat

1093
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,359
ion exchange capacity cec because that

1094
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,039
is your

1095
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,799
major nutrients those are your really

1096
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,318
important ones

1097
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,560
there's a lot of misnomers about

1098
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,318
nitrogen

1099
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,759
there's a tremendous amount of nitrogen

1100
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,000
already in soil systems

1101
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,440
and in the air around us it's just a

1102
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,920
matter of capturing it

1103
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,838
and the same is true with phosphorus and

1104
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,358
potassium to some degree

1105
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,679
this is why it's so important to do a

1106
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:52,559
soil test and i highly recommend you do

1107
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,440
a test

1108
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,358
prior to the grow and after the growth

1109
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,079
so you can see what that cultivar

1110
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,679
stripped from your soil in a perfect

1111
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,720
regenerative agriculture

1112
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,838
50 of what you grow is being left

1113
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:09,759
in the soil for the next grow if you do

1114
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:11,759
not do that you are removing

1115
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,200
more than you're leaving behind so

1116
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,560
that's something to think about and

1117
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:16,639
in a high value plant you're not going

1118
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,318
to leave half your cannabis plant behind

1119
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,759
so if you do not test your nutrients

1120
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:20,960
especially if you're running the same

1121
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,640
cultivar

1122
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,559
multiple times you will have

1123
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:26,078
deficiencies of some kind

1124
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,078
each cultivar removes different

1125
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,599
nutrients at different levels

1126
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,280
so it's important you do your soil

1127
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,599
testing and that's something that i

1128
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,119
think the cannabis industry as a whole

1129
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,800
has neglected to deal with they've kind

1130
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,318
of just bro scienced it it just threw

1131
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,039
more and more and more at it

1132
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:41,838
and then i get calls about nutrient lock

1133
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,759
and so

1134
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:45,199
you know this is how to avoid throwing

1135
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,200
wasting money

1136
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:49,279
purchasing nutrients that you don't need

1137
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,039
and what is a nutrient lock

1138
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,960
nutrient lock is when you get out of

1139
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,159
balance with the different nutrients in

1140
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,960
the system

1141
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,399
ph is one thing that can screw that up

1142
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,838
another thing is you have too much of

1143
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,960
one nutrient it locks out another

1144
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:03,279
nutrient

1145
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,119
um it just causes havoc you know again

1146
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,280
you want to have balanced nutrition

1147
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,640
like give an example of one where if you

1148
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,079
have too much of it

1149
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,318
the plant won't be able to update you

1150
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,480
guys all heard about nitrogen sickness

1151
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:16,239
you know and the plant starts to harm me

1152
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,000
freaks out

1153
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,439
because it locks out all the other

1154
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,480
nutrients so

1155
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,200
and there's a lot of these different um

1156
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,039
relationships that can can screw you up

1157
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,159
so again you know i i'm not a soil

1158
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,639
chemist

1159
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,078
i i have a good friend chip osborne from

1160
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,199
osborne organics who i

1161
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,079
often uh chop it up with to talk about

1162
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,199
these different

1163
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,800
uh interactions between nutrients when i

1164
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,679
get a soil test like again i'll read

1165
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,839
through the whole thing

1166
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,039
you know i focus first on the saturated

1167
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:46,960
paste test

1168
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,318
then i look for your micronutrients if

1169
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,760
those two are in balance

1170
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,759
then i'll go up and look at the

1171
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,440
relationship of sulfur

1172
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,240
to calcium and some of these other

1173
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,079
critical relationships but

1174
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:00,318
for the most part if you have those

1175
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,920
first few steps okay

1176
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,440
um you're not gonna have any issues but

1177
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,079
you're also saying you definitely want

1178
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,159
to test

1179
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,920
in between harvest no because yeah in

1180
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:09,759
between yes you want to test

1181
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,079
when you start and after you've

1182
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,280
harvested it just to make sure that you

1183
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,720
didn't lose something

1184
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,800
because you're not being regenerative

1185
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,318
you're not putting back

1186
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,560
think about this like i always tell

1187
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:23,920
people everything that you're not

1188
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,119
using your stocks your leaves

1189
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,960
everything should be returned to the

1190
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,119
soil because it took

1191
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,880
those nutrients out of that soil that's

1192
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,519
exactly what that plant needs to have

1193
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,480
put back

1194
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:36,960
into the soil so even if it's trim even

1195
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,480
if it's low-grade trim or moldy bud

1196
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,159
crunch it up grind it up do whatever the

1197
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,960
hell you want but put it back into the

1198
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,480
soil

1199
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,079
you know people oh the mold the mold

1200
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,679
spread no the mold is because you're an

1201
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,079
idiot you didn't have a balanced soil

1202
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:49,519
system you didn't have a healthy plant

1203
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,760
but it's not going to spread to the next

1204
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,440
plant as long as you have good biology

1205
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,119
if you're grow if you're growing you

1206
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,039
know with salts forget it don't do that

1207
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,440
that's you're going to kill yourself

1208
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:00,800
but if you have a healthy soil system

1209
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,760
all of that's food

1210
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,400
you know that petritis that refusarium

1211
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,160
is all

1212
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,400
just going to get gobbled up by the

1213
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,000
other organisms that are in the soil

1214
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,720
unless you are out of control out of

1215
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,039
balance so if you're if your plant

1216
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,039
is dyed because of fusarium and you snap

1217
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,239
it open and that nasty white pussy stuff

1218
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:19,759
comes out

1219
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,199
get rid of it right but if you have a

1220
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,800
little bit in there it's not the end of

1221
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,358
the world it's just

1222
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,240
common sense yeah common fucking sense

1223
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,358
people

1224
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,959
it's really not that hard but

1225
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,719
you know those are those are some of the

1226
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,679
things that i think are missing

1227
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,078
in in the deeper understanding of living

1228
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,440
soil

1229
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,200
systems like to to not include sand silt

1230
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,960
and clay

1231
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,879
you know how many organisms you just

1232
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,318
threw out of the out of the matrix that

1233
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,559
are not going to last in there

1234
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,679
if they don't have what they need to

1235
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,759
live on

1236
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,358
there's no way they're going to sustain

1237
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,040
in that soil system

1238
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,679
so if you're just growing with a super

1239
00:44:55,039 --> 00:45:00,318
soil don't bother getting crazy and

1240
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:00,719
doing compost teas and all this i mean

1241
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:04,079
yes

1242
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,439
those compotes will unlock the nutrients

1243
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,880
that you put in there

1244
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,240
but it's never going to colonize

1245
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,200
therefore you're going to always have to

1246
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,239
be adding these

1247
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,759
compost teas back in that's how you know

1248
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,399
cannabis was grown when it was

1249
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,079
pushed indoors and they realized that

1250
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,240
these salt growers were a problem

1251
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,680
and the taste was a problem and the high

1252
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,679
wasn't the same

1253
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:25,199
they started talking to their parents

1254
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,440
and grandparents and said hey when you

1255
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,159
guys grew how did you do it

1256
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,440
and the hippies the hippies they knew

1257
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:33,920
what they were doing but they didn't

1258
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,400
understand the relationship

1259
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,680
of the soil that they were putting in

1260
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,680
the ground they were just putting their

1261
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,838
potting soil in these pits

1262
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,000
up on the mountains and there was an

1263
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:47,119
incredible microbial community

1264
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,199
that would tap right into that plant and

1265
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,720
they didn't write it down and consume

1266
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,159
well they had these amazing nutrient

1267
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,919
formulas like you know some of the

1268
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,279
formulas i saw from the oldies or the

1269
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,960
ogs were

1270
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,119
really fucking impressive like i was

1271
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,880
like man how did you guys know

1272
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,720
all of those nutrients and that balance

1273
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,000
we're going to lose our life

1274
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:08,719
you know i figured that i figured that

1275
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,440
you know they they probably learned by

1276
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:13,919
by repeating and seeing different things

1277
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,960
um more so than being like oh i'm a soil

1278
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,920
scientist

1279
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,760
this this this right so eventually you

1280
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,358
know the indoor guys started going okay

1281
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,880
we got to get away from salt it's too

1282
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,799
expensive

1283
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,800
and we want to go to a living soil like

1284
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,839
our grandparents or great grandparents

1285
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,839
grew

1286
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:31,440
we want that fire that we used to have

1287
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:33,440
when we were growing up

1288
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,559
and so then the push to living soils

1289
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,800
came around

1290
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,679
but again the biggest problem with the

1291
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,000
living soils

1292
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,000
was there's no sand silt and clay it was

1293
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,358
just purely organic matter so a

1294
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,039
lot of the communities

1295
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,799
and multiple communities of

1296
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,440
microorganisms

1297
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,000
that successionally push that soil

1298
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,358
through

1299
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,039
its many many different phases

1300
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,199
were not present because there was

1301
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,199
nothing for them to live on

1302
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,480
so it you know it gets complicated in

1303
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,559
the thought of like just

1304
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,599
how many communities you've you've

1305
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,119
prevented from

1306
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:11,280
colonizing by not including those basic

1307
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,119
sand silt and clay ingredients so it's

1308
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,280
all about biomimicry you know all i'm

1309
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,760
doing is copying the way nature does it

1310
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,280
and if you do that that system will last

1311
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,720
you a lifetime

1312
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,079
sure you're going to have to amend the o

1313
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:23,279
horizon some of it's going to get

1314
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,880
gobbled up

1315
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,480
but that's just a matter of top dressing

1316
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,000
between cycles it's not it's not it's

1317
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,679
not like you have to drag this whole

1318
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,400
thing in and out

1319
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,719
um you know i worked with a client who

1320
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,200
had a budget of

1321
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:39,118
270 000 for a soil system

1322
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:40,558
which he had to replace after every

1323
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,760
fucking grow

1324
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,200
and i spent 50 000 and built him a

1325
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,520
system he's never gonna have to touch

1326
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,279
so so you're saying like innumerable

1327
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:51,759
numbers of harvests out of

1328
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,760
ever forever as long as you live you

1329
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,400
again you may have to add and afford not

1330
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,400
to do it

1331
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,160
right nobody can it's it's in these

1332
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,680
these guys these you know these salt

1333
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:01,759
growers are just like

1334
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,118
oh i can't do that oh you're gonna bring

1335
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,160
in all these bad things i'm gonna have

1336
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,559
all these problems i'm like

1337
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:08,000
no if you do this right and you

1338
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,160
inoculate it right you're not going to

1339
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,318
have any issues whatsoever

1340
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:13,759
because you have the sand silt and clay

1341
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:14,880
you have the diversity of the

1342
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,559
microorganisms

1343
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,000
that will keep everything in balance

1344
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,680
yeah you're going to have a little

1345
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,880
you know little shit here and there but

1346
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,598
you're not going to have this let me ask

1347
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,318
you a question

1348
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,519
the um dry farmers on the banks of the

1349
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,079
eel river aren't they

1350
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,679
like now tom weaves dry farming well

1351
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,160
every conversation of this because

1352
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:32,159
aren't

1353
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,239
like don't aren't they naturally doing

1354
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,399
this isn't it naturally happening right

1355
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:38,799
so dry farming is not dry

1356
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,880
there's nothing dry about it they're

1357
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,359
building they're building on an aquifer

1358
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,160
no

1359
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,920
obviously i mean all that all that

1360
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:47,759
refers to is water coming

1361
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,519
from leaking out of the sign of the

1362
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,280
mountains leaking out of the side

1363
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,199
oozing out and coming coming out that's

1364
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,280
why those farms only work where they

1365
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,639
have that aquifer at the right level but

1366
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,000
they definitely have a lot of nutrients

1367
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,960
there they're right by the river

1368
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,960
yeah yeah right yeah yeah but i'm saying

1369
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,800
before you get down to the water

1370
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,559
isn't there the silt and sand the levels

1371
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,720
doing the sort of the same thing the

1372
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,519
banks of a river is not a bad spot for a

1373
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:14,078
plant to grow

1374
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:16,239
no it's ideal it could find worse places

1375
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,960
if you fly over the country

1376
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,639
everywhere you see a green stripe is a

1377
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,079
is a river

1378
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,639
you know even though you have the fields

1379
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,318
mowed down with crops everywhere else

1380
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,400
where the crop fields stop you'll see

1381
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:29,838
these green snake-like things those are

1382
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,680
just creeks those are where all that

1383
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:33,920
groundwater is oozing out

1384
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,838
and providing all of the necessary

1385
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,599
elements for those plants to grow in in

1386
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:39,519
diverse environments

1387
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,079
so you know that's dry farming that's

1388
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:44,800
just again nature doing its thing

1389
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,200
so laden equally as important are you a

1390
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,559
uh

1391
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,919
socks and sandals kind of guy uh yeah

1392
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,240
well i guess so

1393
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,838
i guess so i got caught i should have

1394
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:57,118
wore my black socks

1395
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:58,880
but it's all about baby yoda so fuck

1396
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,000
all right all right what's next all

1397
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:06,240
right so now we need about

1398
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,559
three buckets of our

1399
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:10,000
sand silt and clay mix so what i have

1400
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,119
here is i have two

1401
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,159
different sansil

1402
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,519
or clay silk mixes with some sand

1403
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:23,199
all right so this this has got about um

1404
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,400
45 sand in it it has a little bit of

1405
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:26,879
rock

1406
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,079
this one is more closer to 50 sand and

1407
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,720
you can look at it all

1408
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,318
that's that's the sand but also in here

1409
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:35,439
is

1410
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:39,039
this one is about um 20

1411
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,639
clay this one is about 19 clay so i was

1412
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,119
really happy about the clay levels in

1413
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:42,879
these

1414
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,800
sorry where were you sourcing this from

1415
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,680
these are from different soil blenders

1416
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,599
in my area

1417
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,838
okay as part of my job i'm always

1418
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,880
finding out who's got what

1419
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:55,838
so that i can work if if the jobs come

1420
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,039
which they usually do so these are two

1421
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:58,639
different sources

1422
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,318
um but you can see there's they're

1423
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:03,358
definitely different this one's darker

1424
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:05,199
this one's a little bit more orange

1425
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,838
i think this one is the one that came

1426
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:10,480
from the mudslides

1427
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:12,880
carpenter no this one's came from santa

1428
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,559
barbara mudslides on a 101

1429
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,079
it might be carpenteria yeah maybe it is

1430
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,319
carpenteria

1431
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,318
but it's right in that area these guys

1432
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:22,480
got i don't know how many hundred

1433
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:26,318
millions of yards of this shit

1434
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,440
wow it was nonsense the whole business

1435
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,119
out of disaster

1436
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,480
literally literally i mean they had

1437
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,358
trucks running

1438
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,079
you know for four months thank you 24

1439
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:36,159
hours a day

1440
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,119
just trying to get that road opened up

1441
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,719
again

1442
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,838
and now they're now they're sieving it

1443
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:41,039
and doing different things these guys

1444
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,639
were like we will take

1445
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:48,480
every dump truck right and this stuff

1446
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:51,519
came from a um

1447
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,800
a river project so they were cleaning up

1448
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:55,838
the river so it didn't

1449
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,240
overflow um and that's in oxnard so it's

1450
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:59,759
it's up north it's towards santa paula

1451
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:00,639
so this is stuff that came from right

1452
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,680
next to the river

1453
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:05,440
yes they were drinking out the river

1454
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:07,279
because as the river comes down in these

1455
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,039
incredible rainstorms it builds these

1456
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,240
sandbars and the sandbars keep building

1457
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:11,440
a building and then it overflows the

1458
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:13,439
sides of the banks

1459
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,119
so these guys go in and they they clean

1460
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,079
that all up in between these major

1461
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,358
storms

1462
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,440
so again this one's a little bit more

1463
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:20,239
silty which is why it's darker but is it

1464
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,760
nutrient

1465
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:26,399
uh rich well the silt and is the silt is

1466
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,079
organic sorry is this the e layer no

1467
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,680
these are these are no these are both

1468
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,240
part of the a

1469
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,199
the o is already made that's our o o is

1470
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:35,838
top this is e

1471
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:36,558
yeah okay and this is middle a's middle

1472
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:38,639
okay

1473
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,319
all right so we're going to e-a-o yeah

1474
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,329
just think of the e-a-o what was that

1475
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,800
song yeah e-i-e-i-o

1476
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:46,880
[Laughter]

1477
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,079
there you go oh now we're mixing these

1478
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,880
guys now we're going to mix these

1479
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,680
together

1480
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,920
and again you know guys if you can

1481
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:56,318
afford to get multiple

1482
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,400
sources of this stuff go for it but you

1483
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:01,199
see how that holds together

1484
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,160
that's the clay and clay has so much

1485
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:03,919
nutrient

1486
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,920
and everyone's scared of clay which i

1487
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,039
just don't understand

1488
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,480
i guess it's the fear of not knowing

1489
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,558
so wait wait wait what did you let's

1490
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,679
back up a second you're saying

1491
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:18,960
you're saying to the audience um

1492
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:21,279
if you can get multiple amounts of

1493
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,880
multiple sources multiple sources silt

1494
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,680
different sources of clay

1495
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,240
grab them up grab them mix them it's not

1496
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:28,159
going to make

1497
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:29,919
a lot of room on your uh drive it's a

1498
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:33,598
lot of weight storage

1499
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:38,000
yeah yeah it is a lot of weight

1500
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:41,760
so now we got to add in

1501
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,039
20 organic matter so that was about

1502
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,760
two buckets yeah and

1503
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,480
let me do the math real quick here into

1504
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,839
this layer

1505
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:55,280
yeah so it's like the trend so we want

1506
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:56,960
this to be eighty percent yeah so we had

1507
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,040
two buckets

1508
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,920
so we want to use half a bucket

1509
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:05,838
yeah right close enough right again you

1510
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,240
guys you know don't have to get crazy

1511
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:10,000
i just smoked weed so but yeah so you're

1512
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:12,000
gonna trust my math yeah

1513
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,960
it's probably right it's probably wrong

1514
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,880
but i mean it's not far off

1515
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,559
good with the math i'm going with the

1516
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,200
man that's called the socks and the

1517
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,319
sandals

1518
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:24,239
white socks so do you feel like uh

1519
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:25,440
martin luther in the early days of the

1520
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:27,838
protestant ref

1521
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,440
reformation yes they laughed at you or

1522
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:32,480
do you feel like um

1523
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,880
carrie carrie they're gonna laugh at you

1524
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,280
they're gonna laugh at you carrie carrie

1525
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,838
carrie's a little dark for me

1526
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,798
normally what i would do in this

1527
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:46,558
situation if this was a big job

1528
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:49,599
is i would install if this

1529
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,960
so if i'm gonna go over eight inches of

1530
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,079
depth

1531
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,358
then i would add i would put in half of

1532
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,318
that

1533
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,358
first and then i would inoculate it with

1534
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:02,079
a high grade

1535
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,558
compost tea sorry half of half of the

1536
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,640
layer

1537
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,280
so so say it's 10 inches right say that

1538
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:10,000
say our horizon is 10 inches

1539
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,760
it isn't we're only at least we're

1540
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,358
talking the a horizon or the e horizon

1541
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,400
no the e is fine okay

1542
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:18,239
e i leave it like it is now if i had

1543
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,920
aquatic microorganisms

1544
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:21,598
i would install them in this and if i'm

1545
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,039
doing a big job i'm going to have all of

1546
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,400
the organisms i want

1547
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:28,239
i'll have my aquatic micro my amos

1548
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,960
i have my images do you have any amos

1549
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:33,439
here i do not at the moment

1550
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,159
but that's not an issue because we can

1551
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,960
water them in

1552
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:38,719
they'll find their way down to where

1553
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,318
they want to are these microscopic

1554
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:41,759
little aquatic

1555
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:44,480
organizations all right so the biggest

1556
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,720
misnomer is that aquatic microorganisms

1557
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,400
can't live in a terrestrial environment

1558
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:50,000
and terrestrial organisms can't live in

1559
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,838
aquatic environment that's bullshit

1560
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,400
that's bullshit everyone knows that come

1561
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:54,960
on

1562
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,519
people okay so i want you to think about

1563
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:00,400
before the great human expansion

1564
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:02,000
when our skies darkened with migratory

1565
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,079
birds and fowl

1566
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,079
and our lands were ripped up by huge

1567
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,240
herds of buffalo deer

1568
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,839
moose they would trash through river

1569
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,919
streams ponds lakes

1570
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:14,719
and rip that stuff up onto the land for

1571
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,559
miles and miles as it slowly dried

1572
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,078
or the biofilm caked their hair and

1573
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,680
their hair fell off

1574
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,440
and they so they were naturally

1575
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,798
colonizing

1576
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,440
everything moving everything all over

1577
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:27,199
the place and we don't have that anymore

1578
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,358
so i you know that's why i've been but

1579
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:31,199
i've been using aquatic microorganisms

1580
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:33,119
since 2008

1581
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,279
that's how i started down at rodale was

1582
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,720
in 2010 as i brought a vial of this

1583
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,760
stuff to lane and where do you source

1584
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:40,719
them from

1585
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,960
from aquaculture i worked with a lot of

1586
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:46,639
different aquaculture companies

1587
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,679
to help them clean up their anaerobic

1588
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:51,679
pockets so they had better fish health

1589
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,039
and i in turn would get the fish frass

1590
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,598
which is what i wanted in the first

1591
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:55,199
place

1592
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,359
so i'd essentially work for them for

1593
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:58,798
free but then i'd get a better product

1594
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:01,920
from them to work with

1595
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,679
in my job so anyway

1596
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,838
petco you should work with petco because

1597
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:07,358
i know they the tropical fish have a lot

1598
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:09,440
of diseases there's a lot of

1599
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:11,199
we love our tropical fish we try to take

1600
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,798
again you know i wouldn't harvest from a

1601
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,439
source that i didn't know

1602
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:16,960
right i worked with many different

1603
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,760
aquaculture companies up and down the

1604
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,079
east coast

1605
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,000
they're ones i will never go back to and

1606
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,480
they're ones that i've focused on so my

1607
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,599
good friend keith wilder

1608
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,679
finally is willing to uh bring his fish

1609
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,920
waste to the market i've taught him how

1610
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:34,159
to stabilize it how do you test it

1611
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,720
microscope okay and his company is

1612
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,480
called fishbrew.com

1613
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,558
and i highly recommend that you reach

1614
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,240
out to them they're presently getting

1615
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,920
uh through all of their regulatory in

1616
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:45,519
all 49 states they're not going to be

1617
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,838
doing hawaii

1618
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:49,039
um so soon they'll be able to sell sell

1619
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:50,798
and ship this product all over the

1620
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:51,920
country and i highly recommend people

1621
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:53,358
use them

1622
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,358
it's a wonderful inoculant you're going

1623
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,679
to have incredible

1624
00:57:55,358 --> 00:58:00,159
yeast plumes which make way for the

1625
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,558
saprophytic fungi you're going to have

1626
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:04,719
aquatic nematodes you're going to have

1627
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,119
testate amoeba which live on the soil or

1628
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,879
in

1629
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,720
in the water environment same with

1630
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,318
rotifers

1631
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:11,838
you're going to get incredible amounts

1632
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:13,679
of amoeba and flagellates

1633
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:15,358
which live again in the soil and in the

1634
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:16,719
aquatic environment

1635
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:18,558
so you know you're getting all the

1636
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:20,078
goodies are there any baddies they come

1637
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,440
along with no because it has been

1638
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,920
aerobically stabilized

1639
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,679
so this is a process i taught keith he's

1640
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,200
like he's like the cannabis growers when

1641
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,960
i first introduced this to them he

1642
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,719
laughed his ass off at me for years he's

1643
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,440
like what the fuck he's like carrie they

1644
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:33,439
laughed at her

1645
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,039
yeah so i've been laughed at a lot in my

1646
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,358
life you know look at p even peters

1647
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:39,358
giving me shit about my white socks

1648
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:41,358
you're gonna have the last laugh yeah

1649
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:43,519
that was kind of deserving yeah

1650
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:45,679
all right okay don't forget about yoda

1651
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:47,440
[Laughter]

1652
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:48,798
so now we've mixed this up and

1653
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,358
traditionally

1654
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:53,039
when i would install a layer again over

1655
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:53,519
eight inches deep i would do it in two

1656
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:56,079
lifts

1657
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,119
so each lift would be about four inches

1658
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,839
i put a lift in

1659
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,720
and i would spray my highly concentrated

1660
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:04,159
organic tea

1661
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:05,759
compost extract on here until it glazed

1662
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:08,159
and i want to soak it i just want a nice

1663
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,160
glazing like a like a glazed doughnut

1664
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,519
then i put the next layer on top and i

1665
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,159
glaze it again

1666
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:14,960
then i'd install my horizon on top all

1667
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:16,078
right so

1668
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,760
for today we're going to go ahead and

1669
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,400
install this and just moisten it even in

1670
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,760
a small

1671
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,240
one in not having that glazing and uh

1672
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,040
yeah well again we don't have any plants

1673
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:26,879
going right in this

1674
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:28,400
oh okay so it's not because it's not a

1675
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,760
big deal okay it'll eventually it'll

1676
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,480
eventually it'll eventually kick

1677
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,280
okay and i'm to be giving him some

1678
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,159
wonderful

1679
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,798
parts of my product liquid and solids so

1680
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,480
that he will be able to feed this plant

1681
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:42,559
as he moves forward we're going to give

1682
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:46,318
you the best 30 gallon pot

1683
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:47,839
ever now i get to stand in the shade

1684
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,759
thank you

1685
00:59:47,838 --> 01:00:01,599
for some labor now you can speed this up

1686
00:59:49,760 --> 01:00:04,160
peter all right

1687
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,599
there's a little bit of sand left over

1688
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:09,440
you know what

1689
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,440
you want to put more sand in mix it

1690
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,000
that is bold waste not want not

1691
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,838
i don't want to bring anything home with

1692
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:29,838
me

1693
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,280
now this is when you put a rake would be

1694
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:49,598
good you put on some nice music

1695
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,599
yeah and you just do a time lapse of me

1696
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:57,838
we're gonna go real time otherwise it's

1697
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:57,838
gonna be boring as hell

1698
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:11,838
so

1699
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:23,599
so we're going to hose that down yeah

1700
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:26,798
tom why don't you give it a spritz make

1701
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:26,798
it look like a glazed doughnut

1702
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:32,318
now this is the most important thing in

1703
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,838
the world so do it right

1704
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:38,798
fuck it up there you go

1705
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:40,318
see how it's glazed see how that looks

1706
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:43,759
glazed

1707
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:43,759
and hit this side a little bit more

1708
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:53,838
perfect

1709
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:01,359
now something that you guys

1710
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:02,639
have to pay attention to under no

1711
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:05,679
circumstances put

1712
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:07,920
any kind of filter fabric or

1713
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:09,358
fabric of any kind in this because

1714
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,680
that's going to happen

1715
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,598
what's going to happen is those fines

1716
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:14,719
are going to migrate down build up on

1717
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,000
that

1718
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:18,159
and you're going to create an anaerobic

1719
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,719
layer within days

1720
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:22,239
so again no fabric ever in these pots in

1721
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:23,838
this system

1722
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,439
copying nature nature don't put no

1723
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:27,279
fabric down

1724
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,358
why would people put fabric down i've

1725
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,280
seen do it like between layers

1726
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:32,558
yeah getting all creative like you know

1727
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,319
these are fabric pots

1728
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,400
that's that's irrelevant it's at the

1729
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:39,599
bottom it's not in the soils

1730
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,000
okay it's people like you know they go

1731
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,359
oh

1732
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,440
clayton's got a great idea i'm gonna

1733
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:45,440
make it better i'm gonna add filter

1734
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,960
fabric

1735
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,440
yeah there's a grow that i know of that

1736
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,119
did that and i'm like

1737
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,798
you know you i don't know what the fuck

1738
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,318
you were thinking

1739
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:56,639
you know and it was someone who's got

1740
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:57,759
some intelligence should never have done

1741
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,519
that

1742
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,599
who's someone who's yelled at me not to

1743
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:05,280
modify their systems

1744
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:08,318
but no names will be named

1745
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,319
for the safety all

1746
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:20,000
here comes the dog

1747
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,559
all right tom make it glisten hang on

1748
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,400
let me

1749
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:23,920
use the rest of it look at that you guys

1750
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,599
right to the mark it's like the uh look

1751
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,720
at that peter right to the marks

1752
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:30,400
yeah the dude the dude who uh lubes up

1753
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:44,719
the supermodels and the

1754
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:48,480
photo shoots the beach photo shoots

1755
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:52,480
let's get it on those those white socks

1756
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,480
you're not gonna leave me alone are you

1757
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:57,199
all right tom pick up that half of the

1758
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:00,960
thing

1759
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:03,439
tom tom pick up that side

1760
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,920
uh right in the middle like two points

1761
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:09,280
and then we're gonna dump it right in

1762
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,280
again waste not want not

1763
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,240
don't want to send peter with a dirty

1764
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:14,239
tarp home

1765
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:23,279
what do you think pretty close it's

1766
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:24,480
looking good

1767
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,880
all right another thing you can do is

1768
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,880
like little spreads yeah little spritz

1769
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,760
glazed doughnut

1770
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:36,400
coffee roll

1771
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:43,038
see how it's like kind of hydrophobic

1772
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:43,038
already

1773
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,039
so i'm just what i'm doing is just kind

1774
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,880
of like creating a little bit of

1775
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,559
penetration for the next layer to get

1776
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,838
down in there and start to mix go ahead

1777
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,839
spray it again

1778
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:09,838
good

1779
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:28,719
now this one we get to use the big

1780
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,720
scooper on

1781
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,000
tom what was the last time you drove the

1782
01:05:34,838 --> 01:05:38,318
mustang

1783
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,318
uh

1784
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,760
probably uh well not during the pandemic

1785
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:45,838
so it's easily been a

1786
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,680
couple a year and a half but you have to

1787
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:51,038
start it every once in a while so the

1788
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:52,798
no i quickly i drained the oil

1789
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,559
well clearly so this is like long-term

1790
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:56,400
storage well

1791
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,079
no i'm gonna tow it i'm gonna have it

1792
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,798
towed and have the body done

1793
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,798
and then they can the engine is in great

1794
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:04,639
shape so they can just

1795
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:07,038
get it started again and it won't be

1796
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:09,519
anything put fresh oil do whatever needs

1797
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,520
to be done

1798
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:20,078
i definitely got a little heavy on this

1799
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:20,639
mix but better to have a little left

1800
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,240
over

1801
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:24,000
because you guys will be top dressing

1802
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:26,959
this

1803
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,480
and this you want to keep in a sealed

1804
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,838
compound bucket

1805
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,159
okay because there is living biology in

1806
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:34,239
it

1807
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:37,118
oh from the your your the compost you

1808
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:37,118
made at home right

1809
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,038
uh

1810
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,559
if you don't have one i can leave you

1811
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:49,280
one yeah i might need a bucket

1812
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,280
we had one

1813
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:01,838
i'm just going to fill it right up

1814
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,838
because it is going to sink yeah

1815
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:15,839
i'm actually gonna mount it a little bit

1816
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:15,839
can't hurt

1817
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:30,399
now tom if you see that

1818
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,400
the straw has blown off

1819
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:43,838
you have hay bales right over there yeah

1820
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:51,679
this stuff i'm going to keep because i'm

1821
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:53,920
just about ready to plant our garden

1822
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,919
again

1823
01:07:55,039 --> 01:08:11,839
you can go ahead and water her in give

1824
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:11,839
her a good good soaking

1825
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:21,039
so i asked everyone this but how come

1826
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,440
everyone always uses straw over like

1827
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:25,359
leaves around your yard leaves are great

1828
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:26,000
i love leaves okay um i just didn't have

1829
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,719
any here

1830
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,238
okay um i like old leaves especially

1831
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,960
some that have started to break down

1832
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,798
because that's good

1833
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,039
all kinds of good critical critters in

1834
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:37,119
there yeah go ahead and hit it some more

1835
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:38,158
because that's it could use a good

1836
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:39,599
drenching right now

1837
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:41,278
okay and again we're not planting

1838
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,520
anything in it right right so

1839
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:47,199
everything's gonna yeah so just let it

1840
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,319
drain and keep this thing and keep it

1841
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:51,599
moist

1842
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:54,080
so peter my my love

1843
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,000
bought some house plants yeah and they

1844
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:58,640
were all struggling

1845
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,920
and she's like well don't i have to feed

1846
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,039
them don't have to do that i'm like no

1847
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,679
honey

1848
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:04,960
let's just up pot them into bigger pots

1849
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,759
and i'll use this system

1850
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,359
now those were 12 inch eight inch pots

1851
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:12,719
so i actually did it

1852
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:14,880
on small scale within 24 hours

1853
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,079
those plants just perked up what size

1854
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,359
did you move them up to

1855
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:22,559
so they were little i don't know

1856
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:25,199
four inch squares five inch squares

1857
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,319
and we got like eight inch diameter uh

1858
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,719
they're not big at all what were they

1859
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,120
paint

1860
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:29,759
planted in previously which just miracle

1861
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:31,759
grow

1862
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,759
just yeah potting soil what whatever

1863
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:36,000
kind with with

1864
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:39,039
center obviously had some synthetic

1865
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,039
fertilizers in there

1866
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,480
but it was it was great to see it i mean

1867
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:52,400
i knew what was going gonna happen

1868
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:55,839
but obviously you know she was like yeah

1869
01:09:52,399 --> 01:10:03,839
i hear you talking about all this but

1870
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:03,840
i'm gonna laugh at you anyway

1871
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:07,678
let's just shake this tarp together

1872
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,640
you can probably just kind of dump it in

1873
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:20,479
there

1874
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,320
you want it might make a mess here let's

1875
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:25,599
do this let me let me do

1876
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:25,599
a couple more and then we'll dump it

1877
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:31,840
you know what you can do is just flip

1878
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,840
that right on here

1879
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:37,039
oh you went a little too aggressive

1880
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,319
there

1881
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,319
so which of these babies

1882
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:54,880
gets to go in there it's the let's give

1883
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,880
me the next question

1884
01:10:55,359 --> 01:11:00,158
these are these look at this plant right

1885
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:03,439
here

1886
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:06,319
look at this look at this one

1887
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:06,319
the both of these

1888
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:11,279
yeah that's the dreamtime haze that is

1889
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:14,719
probably also the same thing that's

1890
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:14,719
also a dreamtime haze

1891
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,400
yeah these are cool tom can you put this

1892
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:21,519
somewhere out of the sun

1893
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:27,839
somewhere where it stays relatively

1894
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:32,159
structured same humidity and temperature

1895
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,159
uh peter i wanted to show you this yeah

1896
01:11:33,198 --> 01:11:37,439
this is what raw clay looks like yeah

1897
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,880
for people that are mining it

1898
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:41,678
or looking for it along the sides of

1899
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:45,039
rivers that's the stuff you want

1900
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:46,560
here tilt it like that

1901
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:48,079
so you'll find these in pockets can you

1902
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,679
hold that like that yeah you'll find

1903
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:51,119
pockets of this

1904
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,719
it's going to be hard to break apart but

1905
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:54,640
when you get it wet

1906
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:56,319
it will roll up like a snake in your

1907
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,440
fingers yeah that's how you know it's

1908
01:11:56,319 --> 01:11:59,439
good clay

1909
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,479
again you want color hold this pot like

1910
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:03,119
or the bucket like

1911
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:04,639
you want color you do not want white

1912
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:07,119
clay

1913
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,880
like that that's called primary clay so

1914
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:10,000
it has no nutritional value yeah

1915
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,560
so you want something that looks like

1916
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,600
this taupey brownie i've seen

1917
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,840
purple i've seen blue i've seen red yeah

1918
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,800
so don't worry about the color the more

1919
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,319
color the better

1920
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,840
yeah and again if you get multiple

1921
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:23,840
colors awesome

1922
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,198
and this was just another example of

1923
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,119
some material

1924
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:32,799
i didn't need because it's too gravelly

1925
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:33,519
yeah but it was something cool look at

1926
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,920
that rock

1927
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,120
yeah this was from another landslide

1928
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,399
what mineral do you think that is the

1929
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,359
yellow um

1930
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:43,039
it's it's feel how light it is yeah it's

1931
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:47,359
it's

1932
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:49,439
it's not a sandstone yeah listen to it

1933
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,639
it breaks apart yeah it has this hum to

1934
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:53,678
it

1935
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:54,239
it's really interesting stuff but i just

1936
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,920
brought these

1937
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:57,678
i brought these kinds of things just to

1938
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,319
show you

1939
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,079
oh there you go here let's put a real

1940
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:04,719
one in there

1941
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:05,279
and if you have any quartz crystals or

1942
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,600
any other

1943
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:10,000
you know um amateurs this is basically

1944
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:13,760
like a big mineral stick right yeah

1945
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:17,600
it's gonna be like super slow release

1946
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:20,719
and this is a mason jar for doing

1947
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,560
soil textural tests okay so what i do

1948
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:25,198
when i'm working with these giant

1949
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,679
uh productions i will bring these out to

1950
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:28,158
the

1951
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,520
to the place that this being blended and

1952
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:33,839
i will take

1953
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,840
a handful of the soil

1954
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,520
again this came from a mudslide another

1955
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,679
mudslide

1956
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,640
up in the santa paula area and i'll fill

1957
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,560
it about 5 8 full this might be a little

1958
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:51,520
full

1959
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:53,280
and then i will take water and add water

1960
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,560
so i have just a little bit of

1961
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:56,559
a little bit of space above

1962
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:04,399
so i have about an eighth

1963
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,600
so you can see that bubbling yeah that's

1964
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:08,879
the clay

1965
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,480
absorbing all that water and getting

1966
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,400
down in between the cracks and then i'll

1967
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:15,119
shake it up

1968
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:17,359
and then 24 hours later 48 hours later

1969
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:20,399
i'll come back and you'll see the layers

1970
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:22,319
a lot of times in the super clay soil

1971
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:24,158
it's going to be difficult to see those

1972
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:25,679
layers you have to look really careful

1973
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:26,719
because that clay gets down into the

1974
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:28,800
sand particles

1975
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:29,840
but it's there and if i can't see it

1976
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,159
what i'll do is i'll

1977
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,239
take my fingers and scoop till i feel

1978
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:35,839
the sand and then measure it

1979
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:38,079
and that way i know where that sand

1980
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,360
layer is so you can disturb this as many

1981
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:40,880
times as you want

1982
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:42,399
if you have to shake it up again do it

1983
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,679
like a lot of times you're going to see

1984
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:44,639
this tomorrow

1985
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,199
that you're going to actually have to

1986
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,880
come back in here and add water look at

1987
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:51,119
how much water just got absorbed by that

1988
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,239
clay yeah it's gone

1989
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,079
so you're going to have to add more

1990
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:57,839
water to really see these layers see

1991
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:57,840
where the top of the soil is

1992
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,440
yeah this this looks like a sponge yes

1993
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:08,559
and that's something people

1994
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:10,319
don't understand clay is amazing all the

1995
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,920
properties it has between negative and

1996
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:13,599
positive charges

1997
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,679
uh between the nutrients that are in

1998
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:18,320
there it also expands

1999
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:21,359
and contracts and when it's when it's in

2000
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:23,119
perfect soil balance with microbials

2001
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:24,559
one will slay like this next will lay

2002
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:26,079
like that then it'll be like this then

2003
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,080
that then this than that

2004
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:29,198
and inside these pockets are where all

2005
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,679
this biological

2006
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:33,759
magic happens because the biology the

2007
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,000
bacteria will set up

2008
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,360
camp and start growing out biofilm and

2009
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,920
start mining the material

2010
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:41,759
of the clay and prevent the clay from

2011
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,679
stacking up like this this was where

2012
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:46,480
you'd see an anaerobic environment

2013
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:47,199
but if it stands up like this it's

2014
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:48,879
amazing

2015
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:50,799
so again the biology is in charge of

2016
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:53,279
doing that and i won't do it

2017
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,400
if you do not have a good solid

2018
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:56,639
biodiverse

2019
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:57,759
again without the right organisms to eat

2020
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,960
the clay

2021
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,800
you're never going to get that clay to

2022
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,760
do that it's going to flocculate and

2023
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,400
sink to the bottom

2024
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,880
right so we're going to leave this here

2025
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:09,279
for you guys to film tomorrow

2026
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,480
tom i don't know where you want this how

2027
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:12,479
about right on that

2028
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:13,599
table over there so actually that might

2029
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:15,039
matter

2030
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,159
because you might want to take that

2031
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:17,439
you're going to probably we're going to

2032
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:18,399
look at it tomorrow and it's going to be

2033
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,839
a bunch of different

2034
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:21,679
but you'll be at home you won't

2035
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:23,920
necessarily well you can look at it okay

2036
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:24,880
you can take pictures okay and you may i

2037
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,560
can't wait

2038
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,239
you may have to add water to wash that

2039
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,760
down okay and then

2040
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:32,399
when you wash that down just leave it

2041
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,600
alone and if you can't see the layers

2042
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:35,279
then what you want to do is stick your

2043
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,679
finger down in there until you can feel

2044
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:37,279
it

2045
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,800
and then wherever that is pull it out

2046
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:39,519
and just make a little mark now you know

2047
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,320
how much

2048
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,440
percentage the sand is gotcha that's the

2049
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:46,559
only problem with this

2050
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:49,359
these uh mud slides is that they've

2051
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,120
mixed everything so thoroughly

2052
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:52,559
and there's so much clay in it that you

2053
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:55,119
can't settle it out the way you do

2054
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:58,480
traditional soils

2055
01:16:55,119 --> 01:17:00,319
nice cool all right well that was a good

2056
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:03,599
day's work

2057
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:06,479
good job team yeah yeah it's

2058
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,280
really out of the sun finally we built

2059
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:11,759
peter's the

2060
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:14,158
proud owner of a new horizon well thomas

2061
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:16,320
tom has it all he has the beautiful wife

2062
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:20,399
the muscle car

2063
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:20,399
the amazing soil setup

2064
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,800
and uh really it is extraordinary i've

2065
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:27,279
never seen i mean i've been on to a lot

2066
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:30,159
of growers but i've never seen

2067
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:32,079
a an environment like that and this is

2068
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:33,759
ideal for biology

2069
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:36,479
because it has all of the important

2070
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:37,039
ingredients to let the biology do their

2071
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:40,399
job

2072
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:43,039
whereas a super soil would not

2073
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:45,439
no caterpillars i'm going to be on the

2074
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:47,519
hunt now tom you need to put a big sign

2075
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:48,000
to warn the caterpillar is not to come

2076
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,239
over there

2077
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,920
yeah so tom what i'd love you to do is

2078
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:54,718
continue to water this

2079
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,640
okay a couple of times a day okay until

2080
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:57,198
you start to see water around the base

2081
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,719
of it

2082
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:00,639
and then we've got the filter on this

2083
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:02,640
water it takes out the uh

2084
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,480
the chlorine and now yeah yeah so you

2085
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,000
keep watering it okay until you see

2086
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:07,919
water come out around the bottom

2087
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,399
okay and now we know we're at field

2088
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:14,000
capacity which is each time i water it

2089
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:16,319
water it until i see them no no

2090
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,359
no just keep watering it okay by gut

2091
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,119
feeling okay

2092
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:20,799
all right you know ideally you'd never

2093
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:23,039
want to over water soils

2094
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:24,000
yeah but in order to get this system

2095
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:25,600
started

2096
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,679
you kind of have to but you don't want

2097
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:30,480
to do it all at once like priming a

2098
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:32,880
chainsaw once i see it pooling out then

2099
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:34,559
you know you've hit field capacity

2100
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,560
and now you now you know that that

2101
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,159
entire system is completely saturated

2102
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,480
and it's time to seed it

2103
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:42,879
and if you want take some of that that

2104
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:44,158
that uh hay mulch off the top of it or

2105
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,840
straw mulch

2106
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:47,439
so that you can see the soil and put all

2107
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:50,079
your cover crop seeds in there

2108
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:52,000
and then just slightly cover it back up

2109
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:53,600
but until you get growth

2110
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,359
we need that to cover the soil so it

2111
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,880
doesn't just get turned into so

2112
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:58,479
so what cover crops do you want to see

2113
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,119
when you come back

2114
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:03,839
i don't know you guys have fun with it

2115
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:05,679
give them a recommendation

2116
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,440
what that cover crop was because that

2117
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:09,600
was real oh uh

2118
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:11,678
steve cantwell yes we can ask him yeah

2119
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,199
well he has dichondra and other stuff

2120
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,880
yeah i the only thing i'd really love to

2121
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:16,879
see is some creeping lavender

2122
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,800
okay all right it's creeping lavender

2123
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,600
tom and it probably smells nice

2124
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,920
yeah it does and again the more diverse

2125
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,000
cover crop you can how far does it creep

2126
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,840
well it could get out of control you can

2127
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,560
you can smell it before you go to bed

2128
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:33,679
every night and you'll sleep like a baby

2129
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:36,320
there you go you're like back there we

2130
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,520
need some vines back there

2131
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:39,439
either you guys got any further

2132
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,040
questions no i think it's so i think

2133
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:42,960
today's lesson was a good one

2134
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:44,479
it was a very good one covered a lot of

2135
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,399
ground but for the people who asked a

2136
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:49,198
thousand questions have you pretty much

2137
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:50,479
answered theirs with this that was a

2138
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:53,198
good question if they

2139
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:54,559
watch this and pay attention yeah the

2140
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:57,279
biggest problem i find

2141
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,280
is they they start watching it and then

2142
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:00,960
they zone off and get monkey mined and

2143
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:03,039
then they focus back in and they miss

2144
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,640
the whole middle section right

2145
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:06,560
well that's what i've watched it four

2146
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,880
times five times but you don't have

2147
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,960
anything

2148
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,480
anyway she just inspired me to sleep so

2149
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:13,039
when he puts it together

2150
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:14,559
those top five or six points if those

2151
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:16,158
can be put in like somewhere in the

2152
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,639
video in a bullet point

2153
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:19,920
that's what these people then maybe

2154
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:22,800
they'll copy it down

2155
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,000
yeah maybe they'll remember it if tom

2156
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,039
transcribed it

2157
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,520
and put it into into the cliff notes

2158
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:31,279
which reminds me ask me about that later

2159
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,360

2160
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:34,719

2167
01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:52,158
and extreme pessimism and we've been

2168
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,119
everywhere in between

2169
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:57,519
