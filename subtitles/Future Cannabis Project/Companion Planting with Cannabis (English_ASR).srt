1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,278
okay so what we were talking about was

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,878
grassroots specifications for how long

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,879
you should cut these things makes it a

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,599
total bitch to

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,000
to try to get everything in because it's

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,359
so taut so

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,800
todd boldly told us to

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,720
just cut them shorter 42 16.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,800
we went by the specifications they're

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,640
very clear they have a diagram it's on

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,760
the site you print it out

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
but it's off by many inches it's they

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,519
make

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,439
it they make it real tight i mean

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:33,920
definitely if you put it together that

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,000
way

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,280
i figured there had to be a secret like

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,759
you had to start

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,719
somewhere and then it would be you know

20
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,320
possible to do

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,320
we couldn't figure it out well for the

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,759
sake of uh

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,878
for the sake of pipe costs

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,960
because when you do like you know

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,960
frustration 40 of them

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
you know you kind of have to look at you

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,558
know the pipe that you're buying too so

28
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,919
a 20 foot one inch pipe will actually do

29
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:02,159
four sets of 16s and four sets of 42s

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,120
so now you've now you know and you have

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,438
like

32
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,640
the cup link is cut off by like six

33
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,599
sections so it makes

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,560
it's a perfect 20-foot pipe so when you

35
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,239
know you have

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,760
you know 24 beds to make you know you

37
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,959
got to pick up 24

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,320
20 foot pipes one inchers and that

39
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,559
pretty much

40
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,599
is the math everything's just math kind

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,519
of

42
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,839
how much your problem solving do you do

43
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,359
while high and how much one that high

44
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,280
all right so we're gonna throw

45
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,280
we're gonna throw this bed together

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,640
grass roots

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,239
beds i always like these beds here

48
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,359
um okay so these are cut 42

49
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,438
and 16. uh is okay

50
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,959
which is shorter than they told us they

51
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,959
told us that these are supposed to be

52
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,798
45 and a half and now they're down

53
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,118
they're three and a half inches shorter

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,399
yeah 42 is kind of what we go with it's

55
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,078
just it's just so easy when you got to

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,560
put 100 of them together

57
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,519
you don't have a lot of time you know so

58
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,280
you because you got

59
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:08,399
things happening so we found 42 and 16.

60
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:10,239
i'd like to put the longer beams in and

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,400
contrary to the directions we're not

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,719
going to do the lower

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,000
you know you know just depends like

64
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,359
again if you're going to put a bunch of

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
soil in there you're not going to touch

66
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,120
it it's going to stay there

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,239
we don't do them because that's another

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
you know that's another

69
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,680
for people who are on a budget that's

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,599
another 100 bucks a pipe

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,200
uh possibly depending on how many you

72
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,560
have you know obviously if it's just one

73
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,238
or two it's not a big deal

74
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
if it's something you are that you might

75
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,280
move around possibly

76
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
then then yeah then you would then it

77
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,759
would be okay to do that

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,000
you know i've done that on multiple

79
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,199
grows or i put the bottom in

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,519
but you know if you know they're going

81
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:49,119
to be sitting stable then

82
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,800
you the the the soil in the bed itself

83
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
will keep the structure which is really

84
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,239
nice

85
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,679
now that we've got all four of them in

86
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,800
just kind of

87
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,800
find the uh find the one pointing low

88
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,480
put that in i wouldn't use a hand a

89
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,239
mallet yet i would just kind of get

90
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,238
everything dialed in and then

91
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
and then at that point you can you can

92
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,158
use a mallet but you're going to turn

93
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,158
that

94
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,359
and then another little trick is is put

95
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,479
this on the inside

96
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
at installation that's going to save you

97
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,759
a lot of

98
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,359
a lot of a lot of time and then also if

99
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,318
you find one is actually

100
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
tight just go to the one next to it and

101
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,119
lift up the bag

102
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,879
and that gives you a little slack so

103
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,239
there's just a couple little

104
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:33,280
little pointers there on that

105
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,519
i think also these uh these ones might

106
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,799
be a little long

107
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,319
yeah i'm going to take off just a little

108
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,360
bit i'm going to do another measure

109
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,878
because i know we measured the other

110
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,840
ones but didn't measure this one so i'm

111
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,479
going to give this a

112
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,479
quick measure

113
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,560
so are we cutting more i'm going to cut

114
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,878
a little bit off this one yeah just

115
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,199
because

116
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:56,079
a little bit longer than i like

117
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,079
about a half inch

118
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:03,280
so what are we going down to i'm going

119
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,280
to go at 20 and a half

120
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,238
nice good timing

121
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:14,878
so these ones are now what 20 and a half

122
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,319
yeah 20 and a half and then the other

123
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,439
one oh we need uh

124
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,120
and the uh the long ones are what long

125
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,719
ones are 42

126
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,399
and the uh and then the legs are what 16

127
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,680
16. again i feel like we probably

128
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,439
needed to go down to a 20. yeah even

129
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,040
though 42 were just a little long can we

130
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,600
just cut that single one yeah i think

131
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,639
probably should just

132
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,320
so we're way below i mean if we

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,160
if we had stuck with their like

134
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,839
dimensions we'd still

135
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,439
still be we'd be out here all day trying

136
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,319
to trying to stretch it like

137
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,319
skin over here

138
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,240
like the skin of young boys that tom so

139
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,079
loves to stretch

140
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,560
oh god he keeps in the well in his

141
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,560
basement

142
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,759
you know the the two by four i've never

143
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,960
put a 2x4 together

144
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,080
the 4x4 is pretty standard

145
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,519
generally the same just 42 16. you had

146
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,399
that put together in 10 minutes last

147
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,839
time

148
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,439
yeah yeah that one was pretty

149
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,198
straightforward

150
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,879
this one too it's just you know when you

151
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,639
put something together the first time

152
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:29,279
once you get the length right then right

153
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,759
now how tall should it be it should be

154
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,559
pretty

155
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,759
taut right yeah well the 16 incher

156
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,720
should keep them up

157
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,840
yeah i'm going to put a couple in yeah

158
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
to see where we're at on that

159
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,000
okay and then this one here is our

160
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,000
troublemaker

161
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,599
so you see there's just a lot of

162
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,758
a lot of extra pipe there so if we want

163
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,759
to

164
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,000
get in there smoothly without any kind

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,400
of cut some more

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,759
yeah we just right there cut some more

167
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,719
and they might be looking at me like oh

168
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,479
man what are you doing you could have

169
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
did this could do that and this and that

170
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,959
but you know it's

171
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:17,839
our goal is to keep this underneath and

172
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,839
pull this one back

173
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:26,079
somehow get that back in yeah so

174
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,599
our goal here is to get this this thing

175
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,279
on the outside on the inside so we can

176
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,240
build some stability

177
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,679
here you can see it's just a little it's

178
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,400
a

179
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,400
a little long

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,360
i want to ask tyler how long it says

181
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,800
this is a great this is a great segment

182
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,240
i mean i put i put

183
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,120
24 4x4s together and i don't know

184
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,360
40 minutes yesterday and this two by

185
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,598
four

186
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,038
there's one two by four defeated it was

187
00:06:51,598 --> 00:07:03,839
defeating me

188
00:06:53,038 --> 00:07:03,839
a little bit

189
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,879
[Music]

190
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:33,280
all right boys we're back in action here

191
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,799
[Music]

192
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:40,318
there it is all right boys

193
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,319
we did that without taking out any more

194
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,198
pipe

195
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,960
and then tom falls over into the other

196
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,160
bed and snaps the other three

197
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:54,638
that's called lay in some pipe so this

198
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,280
whole part is uh we're companion plant

199
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,478
in right

200
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:01,519
yep so let's grab our

201
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:04,000
soil and you can see

202
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,918
based on the measurements here where

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,439
there's a little bow in it so we could

204
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,959
you can honestly you could have got

205
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,240
probably got rid of

206
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,959
you know we forced it in there but you

207
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,720
see that bow a couple of bows so we can

208
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,399
probably have gone a little bit shorter

209
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,080
yeah and made it a little bit easier for

210
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,598
ourselves there

211
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,399
but then we'd have to pull it all apart

212
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,399
and re-measure so

213
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,960
we

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,560
where's the other camera there oh there

215
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,918
it is

216
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,958
so yeah you got some basin this is a

217
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,958
beautiful mix here yeah

218
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,879
and we'll and this it'll still be pretty

219
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,039
heavy

220
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:50,159
uh it's this the the the uh tuber is

221
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,439
it's a wonderful material yeah you can

222
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,559
definitely see the little bow in there

223
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,519
we could have probably clipped off

224
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,639
another

225
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:00,080
couple inches off the uh

226
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,080
yeah the horizontal

227
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,839
42 inchers probably got got away on this

228
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,599
one

229
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:13,760
it's just strange to me that uh

230
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:23,839
you think it would be 16 16

231
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:23,838
42 similar to that one but

232
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,560
so what do we have four of these bags

233
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:36,080
yeah it looks like there's four troopers

234
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:38,879
and a king's mix right

235
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
going to squeak by yeah you'll make it

236
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,159
by

237
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,120
be perfect so thank you to royal gold

238
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,199
for the soil

239
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,720
and uh green coast hydro which is

240
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,879
a cum shot away from tom's place

241
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,920
rich rich over at uh royal yeah it's

242
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,720
about 10 minutes away

243
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,719
rich is the man

244
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,599
yeah so the bed looks great a little bow

245
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,519
but we're able to get it through it and

246
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,920
you see them come on this side

247
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,278
without making the uh you see without

248
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,278
the six without making the bottom we

249
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:20,078
still have some integrity

250
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,799
because it's it's it's packed with soil

251
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,559
so

252
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,319
you can save a lot of work a lot of time

253
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,759
a lot of little

254
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,480
extra money if you don't do the bottom

255
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,078
but again

256
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,680
it's all preference it's all about what

257
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,039
you're going to do with the bed

258
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,039
what kind of stability you want

259
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,278
go for your little kings mix

260
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,160
so i'm sorry elaborate on what you were

261
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,078
just saying what would we have done

262
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,759
differently with the bottom

263
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,919
uh like you guys were making the uh

264
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,360
the actual skeleton for the bottom of

265
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,679
the bed as well

266
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,480
the soil is enough to keep its integrity

267
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,838
so

268
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,839
it's not necessary

269
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:13,600
[Music]

270
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,000
so with those four then we're gonna grab

271
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,800
uh

272
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,799
right there so premium mix

273
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,679
so this is our uh organics live premium

274
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,919
mix

275
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,039
this is vegetables and then tom grab the

276
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,399
are we using some

277
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,599
horizon what what about this

278
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,360
uh this one we're going to use the

279
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,800
premium mix for this one i thought we

280
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,240
used the premium mix

281
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,759
plus this for the other one i thought

282
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,039
this one is actually really good for top

283
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,200
dress

284
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,519
so you could take the rest of that all

285
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,200
right and try and dress these guys yeah

286
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,560
that'd be perfect for that this yeah

287
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,759
so that will actually put in the

288
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,759
watering can okay

289
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,000
so here's some premium mix we had four

290
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,159
bags and some of uh

291
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,799
tuper and then one bag of king's mix and

292
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:05,919
then with this mix i would

293
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,919
just kind of give it an eye

294
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,879
so i'd say probably a a half a bag of

295
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,079
premium mix

296
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,078
to those four bags

297
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,799
the companion plants that will be in

298
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,959
here will be very happy

299
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,879
and with these castings when you do the

300
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,919
when you do a blend it's nice to

301
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,240
blend the whole thing in there try to

302
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,958
get

303
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,440
uh you don't have to go you have to go

304
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,439
to the

305
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,720
very very bottom but it's nice to at

306
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,839
least get

307
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,839
that first

308
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,919
you actually do it from the other side

309
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:52,159
so that your ass is not uh

310
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:54,078
there you go

311
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,199
the last one i would have to like cut

312
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,479
when someone was like

313
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,160
bent over and their crack was showing

314
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,079
so you see there we go we just kind of

315
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,159
added a little bit of premium mix

316
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,838
just kind of based on just eyeing it

317
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,360
some experience the way it's smashing

318
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,600
honestly you could probably go

319
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,600
with the entire bag of premium mix

320
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,078
so four bags you want to get your hands

321
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:24,000
in there

322
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:27,278
get that spread that out all over

323
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,278
and just give it a good

324
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,120
good blending and you know you can keep

325
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,839
it in the top

326
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,839
top 12 inches

327
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,159
nice top dress oh that's beautiful that

328
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:48,000
looks good

329
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:50,078
looks like our bag count was spot on

330
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,198
so we already have uh what do the

331
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,319
marigold do

332
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,838
they attract the marigolds actually yeah

333
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,000
it attracts different yeah different

334
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:02,079
predators but really it repels

335
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,519
uh the repel of the caterpillars uh

336
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:07,838
any kind of like a moth that's going to

337
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,759
lay caterpillars

338
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,519
these are going to some of these

339
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,278
companion plants are going to help

340
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,560
help a lot and then with so one some

341
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,039
will repel

342
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,638
and some will bring in those things it

343
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,319
brings in helps repel

344
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,680
so it's basically you're just using

345
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,278
nature to kind of

346
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,719
you know like they can smell something

347
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,000
they're not going to go near it it's

348
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
just a sense that they're going to give

349
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,078
off

350
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,320
and then if they're it is their the

351
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,278
the distance between them yeah keeping

352
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,440
them close

353
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,320
usually usually it'd be nice just to

354
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,279
kind of

355
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,800
plant in with the bed uh but we have so

356
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,320
many seeds here tom you could do that

357
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,000
you could you could toss in a couple in

358
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,399
here you can toss in a couple of there

359
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,278
i mean you can toss in uh you know

360
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,480
trouble areas

361
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,480
entryways you know just kind of

362
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,839
every every everywhere because they're

363
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,879
beautiful plants too you know they're

364
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,519
beautiful flowers

365
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,278
they make things look good so you know

366
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,560
you can kind of just put them everywhere

367
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,399
and and avoid avoid any kind of

368
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:09,679
insurgency

369
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,679
really so yeah it looks looks great

370
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,799
now uh perfect and then what else did we

371
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,720
bring uh so

372
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,159
that was so that's your so that's your

373
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,800
soil set

374
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,198
and so just kind of based on some of the

375
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,359
things we would we had spoken about

376
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,879
so we got a come stand over there there

377
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,079
you go we got some uh the jewel blend

378
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,879
it's nosterium okay all right and what's

379
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,399
that do

380
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,078
uh the string the same thing just kind

381
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,159
of brings in repels

382
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:41,758
so you know you're looking at repelling

383
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:44,958
aphids caterpillars

384
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,919
just all sorts of different enemies of

385
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,518
the butterfly

386
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,838
in essence you know things that just

387
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,480
really bring in good and repel

388
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,160
repel all sorts of stuff so these are

389
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,278
really going to help nastram

390
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,198
yeah the uh the calendula and then the

391
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,600
marigold which i find the marigold

392
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,120
really good especially on big scale

393
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,480
because you know when you're out there

394
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,839
on a giant field you really don't have

395
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,120
the time to pluck off

396
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,800
the caterpillars that you would

397
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,679
sometimes if you were to go completely

398
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,439
organic

399
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,879
when you have just four plants so

400
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,079
marigolds actually

401
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,360
is going to be something really good to

402
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:16,078
plant and you can plant a couple of

403
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
those

404
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,159
just kind of they're seeds so you just

405
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,959
you can plant them around the plants

406
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,759
okay you know and then uh you got talked

407
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,159
about bringing some

408
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,600
some parsley and some basil so we got

409
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,439
some of that as well

410
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,639
so you know you can just kind of plant

411
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,720
them around here

412
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,399
kind of set it aside and then they plant

413
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,278
a couple around the bed

414
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,240
and uh and just kind of help the plants

415
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,120
naturally

416
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,000
avoid pathogens awesome and that along

417
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,879
with

418
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,919
the worm castings the the beneficial

419
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,838
biology

420
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,159
all that together should really make

421
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,480
make it so that you don't have to

422
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,360
use any kind of pesticide you know that

423
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,399
would be great

424
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,399
now in addition to trellising

425
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,399
at what point we want to start using

426
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,640
these other nutrients and things that

427
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,798
you left

428
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,720
with us last time okay so yeah so if you

429
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,000
if you look at the uh the food chart so

430
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,679
basically right now

431
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,838
we're still in veg but we're gonna start

432
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,079
turning here uh probably like the first

433
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,000
of

434
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,119
august it'll start to move into

435
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,720
transition

436
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,719
so at that point tom you just want to

437
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,160
start adding in so you want to use your

438
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,519
vn

439
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,279
10-2-2 soluble powder

440
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,279
and when do i use this okay so this is

441
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,160
your transition this is a 4-5-5

442
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,160
so this is about now right this is a 455

443
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,000
you're getting close to that time yeah

444
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,400
and then you have let me see where's

445
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,359
your vn you might have used did you use

446
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,720
all the vm because

447
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,719
not all oh there you are there's your

448
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,279
dry soluble right there not all at all

449
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,480
so so basically right now since they're

450
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,678
the plants are getting big they're

451
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
getting hungry

452
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,360
um you're going to use you're going to

453
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,480
use

454
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,359
the 10-2-2 and then you're in about a

455
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,759
one week

456
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,038
or two weeks on the first or so you're

457
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,119
going to start bringing in your

458
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,079
five five and then bring those in

459
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,038
together

460
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,639
at one teaspoon each right for about

461
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:10,798
about two to three weeks

462
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,000
and then you can start to eliminate this

463
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,759
because they're gonna have plenty

464
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,279
nitrogen they're gonna start moving into

465
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,400
flowering so then you have

466
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,599
a more round all-purpose four five five

467
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,960
so the plants are still getting the

468
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,279
nitrogen they need to stretch

469
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,160
nitrogen needed to build uh but then

470
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,038
you're adding

471
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,320
the phosphorus and potassium in there as

472
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,839
they're going to you want to add those

473
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,839
into the soil so this way

474
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,599
the plants can say oh hey look at i got

475
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,079
some of this i'm ready for it

476
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,038
it's available to me so i'm set to go so

477
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,199
you'll use that for

478
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,839
two three weeks and then you'll continue

479
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,360
to use this and then bring in the pk

480
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,000
when you go when you when you

481
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,678
get that when this when the stretch and

482
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,279
the stretch is over

483
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,798
and the flower uh

484
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,000
begins to start its bulk then exactly so

485
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:58,798
that's your k

486
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,640
oh that's your pk perfect sound that was

487
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,960
a nice rugby top there was it actually

488
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,960
was

489
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:11,519
like that's

490
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,600
awesome so yeah so your pk

491
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,440
your zero tenants you still have these

492
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,719
yeah you also watch rugby

493
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,640
in addition to your uh

494
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,079
tom where's the camera hey leave me

495
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,600
alone so

496
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,759
this is actually a great kind of little

497
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:29,038
set up here of the items

498
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,759
that that we need so tom before before

499
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,359
they get

500
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:36,400
too big or or too far into flower

501
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:39,759
take one to two milliliters

502
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,440
two milliliters and one teaspoon

503
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:42,798
and give them a foliar in the morning

504
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
with those three

505
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,839
together combined together combine all

506
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,599
these i've been doing them separately

507
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,000
but i can combine you combine all three

508
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,558
it's called

509
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,119
we call it the trio okay so high noon

510
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:56,399
what are you doing

511
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,639
so fcv fpt and vn

512
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,240
dry soluble one two teaspoon one

513
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
teaspoon two milliliters two to four

514
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,400
milliliters

515
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,479
two to four milliliters there's always a

516
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,559
two to fours it's two four so if this is

517
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,000
a bigger plant you're going to be able

518
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,918
to use probably four

519
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,279
okay right and then just do foliar in

520
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,840
the morning one time that's going to

521
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,879
help

522
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,119
that's going to help a lot with heat

523
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,640
stress it's going to create thick

524
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,000
thick stocks you have some some great

525
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,240
thick socks but that's going to help

526
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,359
kind of mend some things as well uh and

527
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,038
then after that

528
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,479
you just you just this this goes to the

529
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:24,960
side you really don't need this because

530
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,279
this is

531
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,279
the fcb is only for foliar so we're

532
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,558
gonna and then we're gonna move into

533
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,519
essentially having the fpf right there

534
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,200
gonna be doing full years afterwards

535
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,558
so you won't be doing any foliars once

536
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,798
you're in the flower

537
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,839
um you know in this in this environment

538
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:42,798
you probably can get away with it but

539
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,798
there's really no need

540
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,240
you know if you can it's all about veg

541
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:47,119
right if you can get all your health in

542
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,519
the veg

543
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,199
everything you need for the plant to to

544
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,240
to take in during flowering

545
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,080
is going to you're going to you're going

546
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,759
to that's all going to happen during so

547
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,558
so is that once a week where i do that

548
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,480
morning

549
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,158
uh foliar yeah i like doing one once

550
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,279
once i'm well you could do a couple like

551
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,799
for instance right now

552
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,720
like on a monday uh-huh i would do the

553
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,639
that yeah i would do on on monday i

554
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,400
would do you know

555
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,000
the triple the treat yeah the trio okay

556
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
right i would do that on monday

557
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
i would skip tuesday and then wednesday

558
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,480
i'd come out and just do fpf by itself

559
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,679
okay one milliliter per gallon just give

560
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,200
them a good spray

561
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,640
and then you know that's wednesday

562
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,240
thursday i wouldn't do anything friday

563
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,240
i'd maybe do a little full year tea

564
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,558
if you're brewing up a tea right so it

565
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,038
would be monday's it's actually tea time

566
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:31,038
did you bring

567
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,399
and the first thing you say is it's time

568
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,240
to make the coffee that's when you

569
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,679
that's when you make the tea but i do

570
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,359
time to make the coffee

571
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,759
no and then yeah that's a great time to

572
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:48,798
kind of put the tea together

573
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:52,240
so yeah and then move into

574
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:54,798
uh you move into basically essentially

575
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,839
this set up here so after veg

576
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,319
this is really going to be your setup

577
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,959
here

578
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,480
so you're going to get the v the the vtr

579
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,640
transition

580
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,640
the back end of transition and then

581
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,400
you're going to add these two together

582
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,759
until the plant is completely done

583
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,519
stretching and the

584
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,400
and the flowers are really starting to

585
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,000
form then you're going to move this out

586
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,798
and you go probably another two weeks

587
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,720
with just the vpk

588
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,720
and then the last two weeks you're going

589
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,038
with just the k because sometimes

590
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,960
some genetics don't really need any more

591
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,359
phosphorus but they really like

592
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,440
the potassium and the potassium really

593
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,879
hardens the fruit brings some density

594
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,400
keeps things super healthy towards the

595
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,039
end if there's any if there's going to

596
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,440
be any

597
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,200
additions of calcium then potassium is

598
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,120
something you really want to add as well

599
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,279
now what about these do we are we done

600
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,558
with these no no those things are also

601
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,879
those are going to be continued to be

602
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:47,759
used as well uh you know this is this is

603
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,039
going to be again these

604
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,599
plants are bigger so we're looking at

605
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:53,599
four mils a gallon once a week

606
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,199
humic it's really going to help the

607
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,678
strength the soil

608
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,519
the biology the alkalinity the

609
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,360
environment and then protein building

610
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,079
amino acids and things like that

611
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,359
for uh for your plant and then your spfs

612
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,678
your fulvic acid

613
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,599
your simple sugars your complex sugars

614
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,519
uh amino acids

615
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:12,639
almost on the percentile so very high on

616
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:13,918
the amino acids so

617
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,000
this set up right here is going to take

618
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,600
you home and then i would grab

619
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,919
and in conjunction with man with

620
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,079
conjunction which eric was here eric was

621
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,320
had like the best segues last time

622
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:28,000
uh and then this way here so

623
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,000
uh the bloom and so that bloom is going

624
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,839
to add your you do a top dress

625
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
yeah of everything around the drip line

626
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,759
pretty much bring it a couple of inches

627
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,038
like an inch an inch an inch this way

628
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:38,400
outdoor like this

629
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,079
yeah an inch and that's going to take

630
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,200
you home with good biology

631
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,399
make sure you have cotton cellulose

632
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,519
recyclers in there for any kind of

633
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,720
pathogens

634
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:49,200
uh and then again yeah

635
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,960
yeah today and then this is actually

636
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,319
really nice because it has a little bit

637
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,960
of a calcium from the fossilized kelp

638
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,678
and then the uh foss from the calphos

639
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,440
mineral

640
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,720
not that it's relevant but the last time

641
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,400
you were here we didn't have these two

642
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,600
trees i noticed that you know i looked

643
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,559
at that i was like man those are news

644
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,480
right there

645
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,240
yeah a yellow trumpet bush yeah it's

646
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,960
beautiful absolutely beautiful yeah and

647
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,359
a ficus

648
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,640
that's beautiful yeah and uh and uh

649
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,399
we've got these trellises

650
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,240
over here yeah it looks beautiful yeah

651
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,640
that wasn't here last time so i also

652
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,679
want to hit it with the pacific

653
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,400
and the microphone yeah so last time we

654
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,679
didn't do

655
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:29,038
uh so so uh are the is this

656
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:32,960
um okay for now

657
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:35,839
um but it also says here you can

658
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,840
actually use this to make tea

659
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,519
yeah you know mycorrhizae is really good

660
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,720
just all-around product for like

661
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,558
anything and everything

662
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,919
yeah mycorrhizae we we definitely

663
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,678
probably had a bunch of comments saying

664
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,240
oh you guys forgot the mycorrhizae

665
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,519
yeah i'm psyched to see what happens

666
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,839
when we add like the

667
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:58,558
fish uh yeah and the mycorrhizal

668
00:24:53,839 --> 00:25:00,399
definitely yeah a little bit of this uh

669
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,038
some of this companion planting you know

670
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:07,360
they look they look beautiful

671
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,359
they're big old plants right there yeah

672
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,639
yeah i love the breeze right here yeah

673
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,399
this is a beautiful breeze beautiful

674
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,880
breeze makes them strong

675
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,000
get some bamboo sticks or something and

676
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,840
you know you can even

677
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
bring a few in and start to hold these

678
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,959
up yeah you know just get those there's

679
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,759
like a pack of 12 or something oh yeah

680
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,880
easy to get

681
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:29,440
yeah um like uh even

682
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,320
once it's trellised i could just still

683
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,798
use stocks

684
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,000
yeah right yeah you can still use the

685
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,558
stock so

686
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
yeah definitely uh use some stocks to

687
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,720
hold these up

688
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,278
hold these two up those as well and then

689
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,440
yeah just

690
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,480
all some of the arms that are coming out

691
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,679
you know they know they know that

692
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,798
they're being held up so

693
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,240
if they know they're being held up

694
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,200
they're going to produce more flowers

695
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,359
definitely that's right

696
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,640
they're just they're real smart okay so

697
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,079
what are we doing now

698
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,640
so we were just talking about top

699
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,158
dressing that uh with the worm castings

700
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,919
bloom has a little cow fuss

701
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,840
little fossilized throw some in there

702
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,360
good castings yeah

703
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,359
cause that won't mix up the water

704
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:25,839
yeah so just a nice

705
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:25,840
around the drip line area

706
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,599
even these little time if you had

707
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,519
chickens we could feed them the uh

708
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:36,480
fan leaves yeah maybe we'll get some

709
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,240
yeah might as well just keep on going

710
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,960
get some eggs definitely tom's going to

711
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,470
have

712
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,519
six tigers yeah in a couple of months

713
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:46,960
[Laughter]

714
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:49,278
he's gonna grow the mullet out uh

715
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,558
but yeah just around here because what

716
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:51,359
happens when you've lived in an

717
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:56,558
apartment for

718
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,558
eight years and then you get a yard

719
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,158
so now you have you know these roots are

720
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,798
really all over the place so the drip

721
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,960
line is

722
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,558
extensive so we just want to make sure

723
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,558
we kind of get

724
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:12,158
all areas now how are they all the way

725
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,839
down the roots yeah the roots are

726
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,559
probably all the way down and

727
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,519
as you can see the top dress the top or

728
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,038
the

729
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,720
when you move away the top a little bit

730
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:21,440
you can actually see a good amount of

731
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,200
root

732
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,240
so these are yeah the root system is

733
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,240
really nice on these

734
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:36,398
perfect swing through beautiful

735
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,879
just kind of get the whole bed because

736
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:40,639
you know based on the drip line the drip

737
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,278
line is where the last leaf is and where

738
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,640
the

739
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:47,278
where the rain would drip over the tree

740
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,120
and that anything from that point inward

741
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:52,159
should be top dressed yeah so you'll see

742
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,000
probably a lot of

743
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,080
a lot of increased health there

744
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,079
especially with those uh

745
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,079
those other plants too as well and then

746
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,319
uh if we're gonna add

747
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,158
you know you can add some food sources

748
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,119
like fish hydroslate

749
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,640
this pacific grow and then you can water

750
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,319
in some mycorrhizae

751
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,000
i know we uh we didn't add that we

752
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,678
didn't have any at that point but as you

753
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,159
can always add it

754
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,200
after the fact and some some bigfoot

755
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,880
there

756
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,159
you know there's extreme there's great

757
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,559
white there's a lot of great companies

758
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,559
that make

759
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,960
what are we using the pacific grove for

760
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,960
we're gonna put that into the water

761
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,319
and then uh water it and that's

762
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,360
basically all the

763
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,278
hydrolysate that the microbes from the

764
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,639
tea will start feasting on

765
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,319
oh okay yeah so that's going to be yeah

766
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,080
a combination of everything here is so

767
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,918
i'm going to brew some tea

768
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:49,038
for tomorrow okay great be great

769
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,278
yeah or you can pre-activate one now

770
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:53,119
well this i mean we're going to use this

771
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,240
now this is very so why don't we fill up

772
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,639
how much water is in there

773
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,038
a gallon nothing's in there now i think

774
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,038
there's water

775
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,679
do you know how much it what's the

776
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,759
gallon mark is it the top i think that

777
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,159
thing is just like there's a gallon

778
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,879
anyway we can put a splash of

779
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,440
basically it's like a half to one cup of

780
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,240
that

781
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,240
per gallon per gallon okay and uh

782
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:27,840
let's see if we can find two uh so a cup

783
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,840
sure perfect

784
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,038
and then i want to get some more water

785
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,038
in here this just needs more

786
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:41,038
mix it around so

787
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:42,480
here before you fill that up yeah let's

788
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,798
add a little bit of this to it now i

789
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,480
know we should have something to measure

790
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,720
well just give it we're gonna eyeball it

791
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,240
yeah just giving her oh yeah

792
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,839
our experience here we kind of know what

793
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,919
a cup is so

794
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:57,199
we're just gonna that's about a cup not

795
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,480
much your neighbors are gonna be like

796
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,840
what's going on over there this is

797
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,360
actually really nice smells it smells

798
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,319
great i like the hydro slate it's good

799
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,759
and then yeah the reason

800
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:08,960
now you can use filling it up to

801
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:13,679
actually uh mix it up a little bit

802
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:16,399
i do have a uh wooden spoon over here

803
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,600
it's perfect yeah so we definitely want

804
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,879
to stir it up a little bit looks like

805
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,319
we've got a couple clumps of the

806
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,278
mycorrhizae

807
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,599
in there you know i don't know if you

808
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,359
guys ever had sushi before but you know

809
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,319
when you make your uh

810
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,199
wasabi with your soy dip you know when

811
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,359
you

812
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,240
go in there and you add too much of the

813
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,918
wasabi it clumps up so

814
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,440
same thing here yeah same thing here so

815
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,799
you want to add you want to put in the

816
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,600
mycorrhizae first

817
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,639
add like a touch of water right you know

818
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,798
do a little uh

819
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,240
stir and then again but you know

820
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,879
everything is going in this

821
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,480
in this one container so regardless of

822
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,840
where the mycorrhizae

823
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,679
ends up in regards to what we're

824
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,639
watering with there's plenty of root in

825
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,559
there for them to find

826
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,720
an attachment site and you're going to

827
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:58,720
be

828
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:10,640
so we're just going to give this

829
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,639
a little water here yeah

830
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,278
i think the plant's starting to forgive

831
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,278
us yeah

832
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,960
like what you guys do man you cut me up

833
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:26,240
you bent me you broke me

834
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:31,038
you stabbed something in my soil

835
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,200
you broke my arm ripped me in pieces

836
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,798
but hey i kind of like it actually you

837
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,798
stole pieces you need a clone

838
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:50,879
this has been so helpful so

839
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,880
extremely

840
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,519
i was like okay i gotta go where do i go

841
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,720
from here

842
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,519
watch some videos

843
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,839
yeah so there we go beautiful you know

844
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,159
and then

845
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,519
get to activate the biology the castings

846
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,559
we've got some fish in there for some

847
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,399
food

848
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,079
you know start that tea in the morning

849
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,158
for the next day be probably ready to go

850
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,158
for another watering

851
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,600
leaves i know you got everything going

852
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,000
and then you guys are set with some

853
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:23,038
seeds and some companion planting here

854
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,759
yeah so why don't we uh should we start

855
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:25,599
spreading this

856
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:26,879
yeah so basically kind of just depending

857
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,839
on how you want to

858
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,840
how to put it together

859
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:39,038
tom where would you like the basil well

860
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:39,038
um laura

861
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:44,398
smart man smart man so we got some

862
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,839
carrots too can we put other things in

863
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,839
here yeah let's look at the marigold

864
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:54,240
so we can just kind of spread that

865
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,919
around a little bit

866
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,159
now we can kind of put some on the sides

867
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,159
here

868
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,519
and what we'll do it's on two is is uh

869
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:10,000
we'll water these in but then we also

870
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:12,960
can do another top dress

871
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,960
that's going to be plenty

872
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,519
probably have a little bit probably some

873
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,640
left over for for that one as well

874
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:27,359
hold on to that and then uh

875
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,360
again we can do a a calendula mix here

876
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,200
and again probably just you don't need

877
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,200
much

878
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,278
these are beautiful seeds and what would

879
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,720
you use as a

880
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:41,679
like a nitrogen fixer

881
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,079
um these are more about these are more

882
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,759
about the

883
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:50,839
pathogen repelling i would use like a

884
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,158
anything from kind of like some barley

885
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:56,480
to

886
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:59,200
different barleys to a different clovers

887
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,880
you know a fetch basically they pull

888
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,600
nitrogen out of the air

889
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,360
and into the soil and make it available

890
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,960
so a lot of your alfalfa

891
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:11,199
sprouts and and grasses and grains

892
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,159
we'll do that but these yeah these are

893
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,158
definitely are more

894
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,358
of replication but they'll still they'll

895
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,760
send new stream

896
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,878
but they'll still have some and what we

897
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,159
do is actually

898
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:24,239
there's this leaf market in my opinion

899
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,720
has some really good

900
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:32,158
companion plant seeds and they also have

901
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,158
they also have some really nice

902
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,799
cover crop nitrogen fixing but really

903
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,480
it's all about diversity

904
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,399
you know having like on our field in our

905
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,878
hemp field we did 13

906
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,480
different types of cover crops because

907
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:46,000
you just have you have to have that

908
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,039
diversity because

909
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,039
and each acre has all 13. yes

910
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,239
okay yeah everything yeah all three what

911
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,759
were the thirteen

912
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,638
oh man there was barley fetch uh daikon

913
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,480
radish

914
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,000
peas sweet peas uh mustard

915
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,760
and they were all mixed in together just

916
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,440
mixed together what we did is we just

917
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,200
you know with the with our wheelie bird

918
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,960
oh that's a big one

919
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,480
yeah with our wheeling back and forth i

920
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,119
think it's mating season because they've

921
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,880
been going

922
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,039
crazy this morning yeah we went back and

923
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,000
forth with the premium mix and the seeds

924
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,000
and we just

925
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,920
mixed them up and just went through our

926
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,719
10 acres back and forth and then we used

927
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,599
a harrow

928
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,480
to scratch it in and we timed it right

929
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,800
before the first

930
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,000
rain so then it was because that

931
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,720
irrigation is going to be very difficult

932
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,920
to manage

933
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,759
that's like the kind of defeats the

934
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,720
whole purpose so we waited right before

935
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,720
the first rain

936
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,239
which is the end of november and we laid

937
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,000
everything down we got that first rain

938
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,358
and then we got multiple rains

939
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,719
afterwards and that was all that was

940
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:42,480
needed now you can water it but then

941
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,519
your daikon rash is going to be this big

942
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,960
so this is all stuff you grew between

943
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,559
they're not growing right now right now

944
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,760
we have marigold right now we have the

945
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,078
marigold growing

946
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,280
in between we have some peas growing in

947
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,839
between

948
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,880
but mostly marigold because out there uh

949
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:01,039
caterpillars

950
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,640
are gonna be an issue so we're that's

951
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:03,279
san diego and that's the san diego

952
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,400
county out

953
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,400
we've seen a lot of issues with

954
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,200
fallbrook with caterpillars

955
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,400
uh so that's the marigold is really

956
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:14,239
helps

957
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:18,079
repel yep it brings in things that

958
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:19,118
uh what is that what are these you're

959
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,440
putting in

960
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:26,559
right here these are the these are the

961
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,838
uh nudestream

962
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:33,358
yeah let me see which i grabbed here

963
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:36,559
yeah french a french blend

964
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,159
oh that's the marigold and what what was

965
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,000
the company you were talking about

966
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:41,519
you know leaf market i found to have

967
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,119
that really yeah that's the name of the

968
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,519
company it's online

969
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,280
um because we want to be certified

970
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,719
organic our cover crop also has to be

971
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,800
organic so those seeds are certified

972
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,879
organic and they're non-gmo

973
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,240
so if you want to take it the extra step

974
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,440
and have your cover crop

975
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,598
it's really important to make sure those

976
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,200
are organic and yeah

977
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,039
it really is so get certification those

978
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,799
are the things you really need to do

979
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,719
and so with all the seeds we just put

980
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,839
down what we'll do is we'll just kind of

981
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,838
top dress everything

982
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,599
and you know we're going to add in you

983
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,160
know based on where you guys want to put

984
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,800
so i

985
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:19,759
i basically put everything around i

986
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,079
didn't put anything to

987
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,920
too much in the center so what you can

988
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,680
do is is based on

989
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,599
what you want to plant and how you guys

990
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,719
want to set it up so you just put your

991
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,519
parsley your basil

992
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:31,519
your carrots

993
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,039
yeah your you know you can put your your

994
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,280
you know if you're going to do carrots

995
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,039
you're gonna do the parsley the basil

996
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,720
uh then you can yeah you can kind of

997
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,079
center them make them and then your

998
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,078
marigolds will kind of

999
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,519
vine you know fluff out and bind out a

1000
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,200
little bit on the on the ends

1001
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,400
and then once you've placed your pants

1002
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,039
and you can take the remaining of the

1003
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,800
seeds

1004
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,279
and kind of just place a couple in

1005
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,400
between and not too much to suffocate

1006
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,079
but and then also the soil is so is is

1007
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,160
so free because it's just companion

1008
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,320
plants that you can almost literally

1009
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,759
scoop one out now what if we also wanted

1010
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,240
to add like one or two of

1011
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,839
these that'd be great yeah that'd be

1012
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,639
awesome i think it'd be pretty happy in

1013
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:12,239
the middle yeah

1014
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:14,078
yeah definitely so we're just gonna

1015
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,679
finish up doing some top dress of these

1016
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,560
and then what and then just water them

1017
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:18,000
in

1018
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,440
and that's you know that's that's going

1019
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,519
to be great and then and then once they

1020
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,960
start popping they grow really fast

1021
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,400
so you can kind of see the place maybe

1022
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,880
like i need one here i need one there

1023
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,200
and just

1024
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,119
toss another seed in uh and same thing

1025
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,879
here take some remainders

1026
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,800
pop it around here and there yeah and

1027
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,880
that'll just really really help

1028
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,560
the plants be be healthy and then i mean

1029
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,680
you go as far as getting some predator

1030
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:39,199
bugs and

1031
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,279
and different uh well we're going to do

1032
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:44,000
an ipm in like two

1033
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,480
weeks yeah i think is that too soon is

1034
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that

1035
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,280
no because these will be you can you can

1036
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,639
actually incorporate these because these

1037
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,800
will be grown out and everything so

1038
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,199
they'll be good to go yeah

1039
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,640
so yeah so that'll be like mid-august

1040
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,960
would be a good time to do the

1041
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,319
as the bugs are coming yeah so right now

1042
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,159
we're right now we got

1043
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,599
a good biology in there right now right

1044
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:02,239
good good you have you have a balance of

1045
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,400
biology of

1046
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,000
very high diversity and you have kind

1047
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,680
and cellulose recyclers that really

1048
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,760
really really going to help the health

1049
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,519
and now you just want to just give it a

1050
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,880
little bit extra love and bring in the

1051
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,000
companion plants

1052
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,039
and uh and some predatory bugs and i

1053
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,079
think you're just gonna have a stellar

1054
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,759
garden for the year

1055
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,480
yeah it's awesome yeah we have a whole

1056
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,200
bunch of other

1057
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,039
uh plants we gotta figure out where yeah

1058
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,879
got a room right here instead of

1059
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,320
and you can you know plant the basil all

1060
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,480
the stuff around it and and

1061
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,680
and make the uh make the cannabis the

1062
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,240
center piece of the show right yeah we

1063
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:36,399
could take

1064
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,559
one of those put it in here and then put

1065
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,240
the basil in one of those like 10 gallon

1066
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,000
pots

1067
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,679
so now it looks great we cleaned them up

1068
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,639
yeah we cut some clones

1069
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,118
we did a top dress we we've shown we've

1070
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:49,440
shown

1071
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,400
how you can make a mistake into

1072
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,320
something

1073
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,760
beneficial you know what i mean i mean

1074
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,079
because a newbie would have

1075
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,280
would have had that broke oh my god and

1076
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,960
maybe you would have cried

1077
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,119
and like i broke one of my four plants

1078
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,679
but not really you know you you snapped

1079
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,079
it but

1080
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:04,719
again you can you look at that the one

1081
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,000
female

1082
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,838
you know you'll you know what they say

1083
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,719
when you break your bone yeah it heals

1084
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,480
strong

1085
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:12,239
you're gonna get it's gonna be a nice

1086
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,519
calcium the cal cal

1087
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,000
callus what do you call that just kind

1088
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,759
of a chunky uh little bump right there

1089
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,280
it'll heal real quick you'll see

1090
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,280
and and that's good i mean that's good

1091
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,920
for even even in someone's experience

1092
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,280
as us you know we look at that it's good

1093
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,559
to pass the information hey it's not the

1094
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,359
end of the world you didn't break your

1095
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,199
plant

1096
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,639
you're actually uh it's it's gonna be

1097
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,759
okay and you don't

1098
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,679
you know some people might have snipped

1099
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,319
the whole thing off and and been bummed

1100
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,239
but

1101
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,480
really it's uh it's the smell a little

1102
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,479
of the fish yeah well it was instructive

1103
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,240
in any way because we bet we were

1104
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,880
testing its you know the bendability

1105
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,318
yeah tom next week we'll get medieval on

1106
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,800
these things and start training them

1107
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,519
yeah

1108
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,160
training them snapping them but i would

1109
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,519
do that

1110
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:59,519
soon prior to transition

1111
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:00,880
you want to keep all the stress and veg

1112
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,199
you want to keep all that stretch in the

1113
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,440
veg and make sure and flower

1114
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:07,039
is your stress and again we want to do

1115
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,318
trellis them early in the morning when

1116
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,719
they're a little bit more

1117
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:12,639
flexible okay early morning okay after a

1118
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:15,199
water okay after a full year

1119
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,920
is the best time to manipulate the

1120
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:18,000
plants okay

1121
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,280
how you how you feel like i'm gonna i'm

1122
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,679
gonna go start looking at literally i

1123
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,599
think

1124
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,239
i think we tried to like literally we

1125
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,760
can literally put them right in here and

1126
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,439
yeah yeah it's going to be so cool it'll

1127
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,800
be great okay great yeah just wait once

1128
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,559
they water you'll see there they'll

1129
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,880
have so much flexibility yeah and again

1130
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,679
if something snaps it's okay

1131
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,079
just just just put a stalk on it mend it

1132
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:37,440
and

1133
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,920
it'll heal within like three or four i'm

1134
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,039
not panicking yeah i broke my i broke

1135
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,039
this leg

1136
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,679
look at that it's still there have you

1137
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:49,119
been an ankle model in a previous year

1138
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:51,358
look at that oh man those are some

1139
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,800
attractions i almost lost that leg

1140
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,400
that's why that was the motorcycle

1141
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,240
accident yeah that was a compound

1142
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,000
fracture

1143
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,679
all right i got to hit the road all

1144
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,239
right but

1145
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,440
so basically he can mix up another batch

1146
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:05,118
of uh

1147
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,880
i would just do plain water yeah just

1148
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,240
plain water you know it'll

1149
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,599
i know some of the seeds i just tossed

1150
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,118
on but once you water they're gonna

1151
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,000
they're gonna fall into the soil the

1152
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,680
soil is real

1153
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,440
i really love that tuper honestly i like

1154
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:16,960
that tuber oh honestly all this

1155
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,559
all the soil in the stores that they

1156
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,240
sell are

1157
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:21,838
it's good soil you can see we're a

1158
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,719
little bit longer on this one than we

1159
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:24,480
are on that one

1160
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:25,919
a little taller a little longer but you

1161
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,318
know it's

1162
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,000
yup it's all right i wish i was a baller

1163
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:31,440
that was a little tall

1164
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,039
i wish i would it's cool now you got

1165
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,039
some abstract garden beds

1166
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,920
it's like a stonehenge exactly rock

1167
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,279
placement that's like what made them

1168
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,318
decide

1169
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,200
to place those yeah well we can move

1170
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,440
this later but

1171
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,279
yeah and it's stable enough to move you

1172
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,079
know maybe we can even move it prior to

1173
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,359
uh

1174
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,039
watering because you still have that

1175
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:53,920
flexion but once you water something do

1176
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,159
you want it

1177
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,960

1181
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:02,960

1182
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,559
