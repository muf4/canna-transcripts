2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,230
so vapor pressure deficit it's the cat's

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,928
meow tell us why

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:19,859
so VPD is really important for a lot of

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:23,670
reasons most importantly VPD controls

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,580
plant evapotranspiration so VPD is the

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,480
vapor pressure deficit and it is the

8
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,858
difference between the vapor pressure

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,320
saturated conditions versus vapor

10
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,850
pressure at the room conditions so say

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,759
you have a room that you're controlling

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,350
to 75 degrees and 50 percent relative

13
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,988
humidity there's a vapor pressure

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,179
associated with that and that difference

15
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:47,339
in vapor pressure between saturation in

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:50,878
the room conditions is what the plant

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,590
sees when it's going to transpire and

18
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,030
move water it's literally if you think

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,109
about it it's literally the pressure

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,870
that the air is putting on the plants to

21
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,760
transpire so when we have a high vapor

22
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:05,879
pressure deficit that usually means that

23
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:09,170
it's pretty dry in the room and plants

24
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,158
will want to use more water to transpire

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,549
when we have a lower vapor pressure

26
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,280
deficit and it's more humid in the room

27
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:21,450
there's less pressure on the plant to

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,570
transpire this is really key for for

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,850
both water and nutrient delivery from

30
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,828
the roots through the shoots and the

31
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:33,179
leaves and going to the flowers and the

32
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:35,069
fruits it's also very important for the

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,380
plant to be able to regulate its own

34
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:39,629
temperature through evaporative cooling

35
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:45,688
so when the plant transpires is also

36
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:48,359
evaporate cooling itself and and so VPD

37
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:51,089
on the HVAC side of things when you're

38
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:54,118
trying to size equipment also affects

39
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:58,228
how well that equipment is able to

40
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,549
remove moisture and humidify the room so

41
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:01,769
when we have a really high vapor

42
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,719
pressure deficit what happens is that we

43
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:06,810
have sort of this double whammy so the

44
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,669
plants they transpire more because the

45
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,060
air is dry and so they're putting more

46
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,379
moisture in the room but that high vapor

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,439
pressure deficit is also

48
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:19,049
really hard for HVAC equipment to

49
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,270
operate and remove the moisture that the

50
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,090
plants put into the room so here we have

51
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,670
more moisture in the room and it takes

52
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,520
now more energy for the HVAC system to

53
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:31,589
remove that moisture if we could find a

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,659
vapor pressure deficit where the plants

55
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,050
are gonna be really happy and not use

56
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:40,949
excessive water and the HVAC equipment

57
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:43,469
can operate efficiently then we're going

58
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:46,259
to have a win-win situation and what's

59
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:49,490
that magic number so the magic number in

60
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:54,030
general for vapor pressure deficit is

61
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:56,340
11.0 kiloPascals I mean we use this as a

62
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,669
general target for a lot of crops like

63
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,110
tomatoes and cucumbers lettuce plants

64
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:03,959
because they're more in vegetative we

65
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,730
tend to like a smaller or a lower vapor

66
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,610
pressure deficit a little bit more humid

67
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:10,799
air with cannabis plants what's going on

68
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,870
is that all these growers are so afraid

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,180
of humidity they're so afraid of mold

70
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,340
that they're driving the humidity down

71
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,689
increasing that vapor pressure deficit

72
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,120
and and are inadvertently putting more

73
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:26,520
pressure on their plants and more strain

74
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,310
on their HVAC equipment to remove that

75
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,130
moisture so if we can convince growers

76
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,069
and having a VPD of one kilopascal like

77
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:37,439
every other crop then we're gonna be

78
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:45,000
better in terms of plant health and HVAC

79
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:47,729
health yes so plant transpiration is is

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,669
the movement of water from the roots

81
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:54,149
through the plant so through its it's

82
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:56,639
from its roots through its chute and it

83
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,370
stems and its leaves and it is what's

84
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,079
responsible for moving the water and the

85
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,020
nutrients to the different parts of the

86
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,990
plants so every plant the the leaves

87
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,300
have stomata on the bottom of the leaf

88
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,719
and those tamanna' are like little

89
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,910
mouths and they're responsible for

90
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:18,060
sucking co2 in for photosynthesis but

91
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:20,548
then also releasing the oxygen from that

92
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,649
photosynthesis and for releasing that

93
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:27,149
water vapor via transpiration

94
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:28,918
transpiration determined by like a ray

95
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:31,799
a rate of transpiration how is it

96
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,139
measured Oh the rate of transpiration is

97
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,340
hard to measure actually I mean it's

98
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,699
probably one of the biggest challenges

99
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:41,429
we have as HVAC engineers is trying to

100
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,139
figure out what that moisture load is in

101
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,720
the room there's a few different things

102
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:48,538
if you are a grower if you are already

103
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,490
actively growing you can measure how

104
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,439
much water is your being your delivering

105
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,090
to the plant through irrigation and then

106
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,519
how much water is being drained away

107
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:58,709
from say the pot or their growing media

108
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,079
and whatever is left is really what's

109
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:03,000
going to get transpired by the plant the

110
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,579
plant really only holds on to maybe a

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,560
couple percentages of the water that

112
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:10,349
gets delivered to it so if you say I

113
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,720
deliver you know one gallon per plant

114
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,460
per day well right off the top we can

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,320
probably lop off thirty to thirty five

116
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:20,668
percent of that water to drainage and

117
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:22,889
then maybe two to five percent for what

118
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:25,198
stays in the plant so really sixty

119
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,629
percent of that one gallon is what's

120
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,160
getting delivered to the room and that

121
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:35,879
we have to remove via dehumidification

122
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:38,550
can you talk about a VPD gone wrong like

123
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,610
when you're above one and like things

124
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,400
you would see the cause the cause and

125
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,919
effect or the effect of it being above

126
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,469
1.0 and like what you might see if it's

127
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:53,668
way below 1.0 yeah so a vapor pressure

128
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:57,330
deficit if we don't manage it well can

129
00:05:53,668 --> 00:06:00,029
have both it can have negative effects

130
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:02,430
both abiotic Lee and biotic Lee so what

131
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:05,579
that means is the abiotic is things like

132
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,379
having poor nutrient delivery and water

133
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:09,719
delivery to the plant so the most simple

134
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:12,209
case of that is having a wilting plant

135
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,190
wilting leaf if the vapor pressure

136
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:15,959
deficit is really high and it's really

137
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:18,478
dry in the room and we don't have a well

138
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,908
watered crop then the plant is going to

139
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,889
wilt because it just there's not enough

140
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:27,478
water to keep up with that vapor

141
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:31,019
pressure on the plan exactly but beyond

142
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:33,990
that you know if if you the plant is

143
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:36,299
transpiring really quickly what happens

144
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,699
is that it can't pull calcium along with

145
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,480
it and so what you actually see like in

146
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:44,110
lettuce plants or in leaves you

147
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,569
see leaf tip burned so like the rim of a

148
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,060
leaf will turn yellow because of the

149
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:51,310
calcium deficiency in tomatoes we see it

150
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,709
as blossom and rot and actually the

151
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,379
bottom of a tomato fruit will turn black

152
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:59,620
because there's no calcium being

153
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:01,180
delivered to that fruit this can happen

154
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,160
both when you have a very dry

155
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,769
environment without enough water going

156
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,960
to the plant and actually also a humid

157
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:10,209
environment because if if it's too humid

158
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:12,519
and the vapor pressure is too low then

159
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:15,099
there's not enough pressure on the plant

160
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:17,169
to move water and nutrients through it

161
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,080
so you can actually see the same

162
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:22,629
condition when it's too low the other

163
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,149
thing is biotic deficiencies and so

164
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:27,279
those are things like powdery mildew and

165
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:29,859
botrytis if the VPD is really low and

166
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,469
it's very humid sure you have a risk of

167
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,480
having molds that grow but what people

168
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,100
also don't realize is that when you have

169
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,470
a really high vapor pressure deficit

170
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,990
you're stressing the plant and just like

171
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,300
humans when plants get stressed their

172
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,370
immune system goes down and so they

173
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,590
actually become more susceptible to

174
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,300
diseases when they're stressed out

175
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:51,219
because of high vapor pressure deficit

176
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,230
so here we are trying to create this

177
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,450
really dry environment so that we don't

178
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,280
get molds to set in but then we're

179
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:59,800
stressing the plant so the one little

180
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,979
mold spore that's out there is going to

181
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,870
really dive into that plant and it's

182
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:09,160
it's going to get powdery mildew because

183
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:12,550
it can't fight against it it's about

184
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,890
education our growers aware of VPD do

185
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,389
they know about it or I mean more and

186
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:18,729
more growers know about vapor pressure

187
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:21,039
deficit I mean I'm I'm definitely out

188
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,780
there pounding the pavement speaking it

189
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,060
way too many conferences giving

190
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:26,649
workshops doing all these things trying

191
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,839
to get the word out that vapor pressure

192
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:31,719
deficit is so critical to the plant's

193
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,909
health and and I am very encouraged I'm

194
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,040
even seeing posts on Instagram and

195
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,659
LinkedIn and Facebook where people are

196
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,329
talking more about vapor pressure

197
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,860
deficit and understand what it is and

198
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,320
why it's so important so I'm very

199
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,169
encouraged by that but certainly we got

200
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,899
to get the word out more

201
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:50,819
and educate people more so they

202
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,289
understand the ramifications both for

203
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,600
the plant but also for HVAC equipment

204
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:57,689
sizing I mean if we have to oversize a

205
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,600
piece of equipment two times of what you

206
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,420
know at a kill at a VPD of 1.5 than what

207
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,250
we needed at a healthy one I mean what

208
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,719
are we doing to ourselves and you're

209
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,730
saying that that's basically not

210
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,339
necessary we don't have to do that we

211
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,709
don't have to do that exactly and we can

212
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,600
save energy we can save on cost for for

213
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:18,208
buying the equipment for operating the

214
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,290
equipment and again we have a happy

215
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:26,129
plant right a happy plant happy HVAC so

216
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:29,429
so obviously cultivators are rightly

217
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:31,198
concerned about mold right their entire

218
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:33,208
crops so they find themselves in the

219
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:37,939
middle you know in this tough position

220
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:40,229
is the goal to create like a a guide or

221
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,079
measurements that they can use to create

222
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,720
the right environment ahead of time to

223
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:50,519
reduce VPD or is that what the

224
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:57,680
researchers or you know what can they

225
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:57,679
yeah so you're asking I'm asking is they

226
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,730
the goal is to create the right

227
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,399
environment so that you don't have too

228
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,070
much VPD is that creep is that correct

229
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,470
that's right so really what it is is

230
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,230
finding that sweet spot finding that

231
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:16,259
combination of temperature and relative

232
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:20,278
humidity where we hit a vapor pressure

233
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:22,289
deficit that's around one kilopascal we

234
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:23,429
have a chart on our website and there's

235
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,439
a few other charts that are kind of

236
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:28,319
floating around there that say hey look

237
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,370
you know at 75 degrees and 50 percent

238
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,209
relative humidity

239
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:36,179
it's 1.5 kilo Pascal's if you were to

240
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:38,009
keep that same temperature and raise the

241
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:42,179
relative humidity you're gonna creep up

242
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:44,519
to 1.25 kilo Pascal's 1.1 kiloPascals 1

243
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:46,229
kilopascal so for a given temperature

244
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,179
you can find the relative humidity

245
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,730
that's going to hit the VPD

246
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:54,958
and I thought the mold and not create

247
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,959
mold exactly
