1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,800
just 12 days ago on September 14th at

2
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,880
7:00 a.m. in the morning a simultaneous

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,000
raid occurred in yellow County as well

4
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:27,000
as uh three of the homes of the Farmers

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,518
on one of these licensed facilities um

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,079
by an outof count task force called Tri

7
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,600
County drug enforcement team or Trident

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,600
which is an initiative of the Central

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,039
Valley high-intensity drug trafficking

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,558
area or hi haa um they came into Yolo

11
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:46,160
County with a plaster County warrant um

12
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:50,039
and kicked doors in and um and took down

13
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:52,279
a half acre of a legally licensed farm

14
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,558
so don can you tell us how you feel

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,960
about an outer jurisdiction law

16
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,799
enforcement agency coming in and taking

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,920
down something that you permitted and

18
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,919
gave your blessing for

19
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,158
so I said that there were about 53

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,799
Growers that are going through the

21
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,240
permitting process about half of them

22
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,200
are are in place and one in

23
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:15,280
particular has a couple of them have

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,200
been really shining stars they they look

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,159
at us and they they look for guidance

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,600
they want whatever we tell them this is

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,200
how things will work they immediately

28
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,640
comply uh they bring in they they set up

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,079
the irrigation system set up the

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,478
drainage they make sure that they're

31
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:31,239
doing all the right things uh they apply

32
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:33,478
for the State for the regional water

33
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,599
quality control board permits they get

34
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,280
all of it in place and then then

35
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,158
something like this happens and this I

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,960
know that many of you here in this room

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,359
have heard this story or even had it

38
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:47,319
happen to yourself or to somebody you

39
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:50,718
know but it's pretty darn scary when you

40
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:53,118
think of of U 7 in the morning your

41
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:56,158
front the front door is broken in nobody

42
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,718
says I'm you know this is a I'm a law

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,479
enforcement official open your door

44
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:03,559
please they break the door in uh they

45
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,000
show up in unmarked vehicles and four

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,479
different locations in three different

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,318
counties uh with guns drawn where their

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,000
little kids involved and they handcuff

49
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,039
people and put zip ties on them and

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,959
they're throwing uh throwing people

51
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,519
against walls and against and they're

52
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,439
making them kneel on the ground and

53
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,239
they're interrogating them without

54
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:25,759
giving them Miranda rights for hours out

55
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,560
a time this is this is a a terrorist

56
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,719
activity if you think about it if you

57
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,719
just think about what's what's happening

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,120
and and in the same and then the meaning

59
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,679
of terrorism what this means is they're

60
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,879
trying to in to instill fear they the

61
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,959
the tactics deliberately instill fear

62
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:52,318
and there and it comes at a time for us

63
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:54,920
when we're we're walking to monitor our

64
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,759
ordinance and we're working to develop

65
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:59,839
tweaks things that we might want to

66
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:05,399
change and we now have this added diens

67
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,039
mention of well what was the offense was

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,239
there something that's being alleged

69
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:14,439
that is illegal that we didn't know

70
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,680
about or that and we're not hearing any

71
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:20,120
specific charges even in fact none of

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,200
the people involved in this incident

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,039
have been charged with anything and yet

74
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:29,919
1,800 plants that are that are designed

75
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:33,679
and and connected to a collective for

76
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:37,798
for medicinal purpose have been

77
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,799
destroyed and the people involved are

78
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,959
very shaken so psychologically shaken

79
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,000
they thought they were doing all the

80
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,080
right stuff they're deliberately working

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,360
hard to make sure they do the right

82
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,680
thing and then so we're we're still

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,200
sorting this out and to have this be

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,000
done from a this shadowy group that

85
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:01,560
comes in unmarked cars with no license

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,719
plate indication and and from another

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,120
County from another County it's not even

88
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,759
Yolo County we're not a part of this

89
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,158
three County it's El Dorado pler and

90
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,239
Sacramento I mean led by led by a pler

91
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:16,399
county a district attorney in his Strike

92
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,120
Force but we we we are still struggling

93
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,918
to figure out exactly what this was

94
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,680
about and how it affects uh the people

95
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,439
involved and I know that the people

96
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,120
involved are are very stunt so I think

97
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:30,519
of it as as a an act of

98
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,000
terrorism so don you just called this an

99
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:36,120
act of terrorism um by Trident and I'm

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,199
wondering uh do you believe that this

101
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,800
will hinder your progress as your county

102
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,240
is is making very big strides in

103
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,800
crafting sensible regulations well I

104
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,400
think that it it sets it it's it sets up

105
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,800
a whole series of questions that we we

106
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,359
have been working to look at the whole

107
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,280
cannabis World Through The Eyes of of

108
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,919
Agriculture and how does this commodity

109
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,719
work how do we how do we support it in

110
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,399
the same ways that we've supported other

111
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,400
agricultural Commodities how do we

112
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,399
regulate it and so on we're looking at

113
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,918
it and by the way we have not talked

114
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,079
about revenues we haven't looked at at

115
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:13,120
this from a taxation purpose we're

116
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,120
charging fees that we think will will

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,639
will absorb the cost and allow us to do

118
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,879
some code enforcement for the the non

119
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,120
for The shadowy Operators so that's

120
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,439
that's what we're kind of looking at and

121
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,680
it and it we've also been looking at

122
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:30,360
more and more the medicinal value and

123
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,240
I'm excited because I want to see us all

124
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,080
look into the greater research

125
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,800
possibilities and I want Yolo County to

126
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,399
be a place where that is where that's a

127
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,079
a center of that kind of activity but

128
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:44,239
now we have a whole other series of

129
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:46,519
questions that we know will be asked by

130
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,720
by my by well by members of the Board of

131
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,719
Supervisors well really was there

132
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,560
something going on here is there

133
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,240
something in the shadows that we need to

134
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,240
shy away from so I think that to the

135
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,199
degree that we allow that to that U that

136
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,038
that Fe

137
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,800
to come from our community members or

138
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:07,719
from our from the the decision makers to

139
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,400
the degree that we allow that to change

140
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,680
our course uh then then the terror has

141
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,439
succeeded so I think there is there is

142
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,639
going to be some discussion about that

143
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,959
and by the way I just I I did to say

144
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,598
this is how I feel about it now there's

145
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,399
we're assured that this investig this is

146
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:27,879
an interesting comment here because

147
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:30,120
we're assured that the investigation is

148
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,759
still underway

149
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,560
now that that means you know it's not

150
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,919
over so there's something yet to happen

151
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,560
there's some this great Spectre of maybe

152
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,918
there's some illegal act that we don't

153
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,079
know about yet so we can't I probably

154
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,399
shouldn't even talk about it right we've

155
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,839
seen the affid I've seen the the

156
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,758
affidavit doesn't look like it's

157
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,239
criminal what they're talking

158
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,439
about but now we have this this Spectre

159
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,360
as that's that's going to it's going

160
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,519
certainly going to change the

161
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,759
conversation to some degree I don't know

162
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,680
how or where

163
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,160
I got the call about this raid uh it was

164
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,879
a farm that I had helped consult on and

165
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,240
uh you know I I really have to say Yolo
