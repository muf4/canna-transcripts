1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
so jackson you're in charge for the 250

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,759
people

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,759
still watching at midnight

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,399
go to bed but that's i

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,359
actually i want to just can people like

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,519
type in

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,679
where they're watching from because

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,519
we're on the west coast time zone and

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,600
it's already midnight so i'm like

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,480
are you people in boston are you in

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,000
south africa

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,520
you want to talk about that uh i

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,399
can yeah i mean um i just didn't so get

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,520
give us our learning moment for the day

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,480
all right one little

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,520
one little teachable thing here so um

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,599
over the years

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,280
you know we we started i think i kind of

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,879
break it down all of this but

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,640
you know usually like when when we

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,479
started growing everything was kind of

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,558
in small pots and you kind of taught

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,159
like keep them wet you can't over water

24
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,640
that's why you use good dirt

25
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,159
if you have bad dirt it's too dense

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,320
maybe you gotta watch out but you just

27
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,759
use good dirt to start it drains well

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,558
and you keep it soaking wet

29
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,239
and uh i remember guys over the years

30
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,840
who would just take a dripper and stick

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,438
it in there and it would come from

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
gravity feed from their spring and they

33
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,559
would literally just have water going

34
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,079
all the time just put a pile of some

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
food on top and

36
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,319
let it drip through and um and

37
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,039
everything was always fine and then

38
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,839
we started to grow um you're allowed to

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,200
grow

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,520
six plants and then you're allowed to

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,000
grow 25 plants and people try to stick

42
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,519
to it

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
and you figure oh wow okay i put them in

44
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,000
a

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,640
now i tried putting them in a i put them

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,799
in a you know a 65 gallon pot and then

47
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,519
they outgrew that so you try 100 you try

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
200

49
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,920
300 some people use 600 gallon pots now

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,478
you know they make fabric pots

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,478
um grassroots fabric pots are a killer

52
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:50,158
killer uh fabric

53
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,719
pop company um i'm not sponsored by them

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,560
but they're

55
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,039
you know i recommend their their pots

56
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,759
are cool but you get these huge pots

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,600
um or you grow in the ground or whatever

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,159
it is but you get this huge volume of

59
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,959
dirt

60
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,880
and um one once they get really once

61
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,438
once you get really uh

62
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,519
deep soil and it's far from the outside

63
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,959
you know like uh

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,480
when we used to do a little bit of

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,000
mushroom growing they would tell us you

66
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,079
know don't make your container bigger

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
than about 12 inches across and 12

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
inches deep because when you get further

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,360
than

70
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
that to the inside you tend to meat your

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,879
your

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,719
your substrate tends to get um anaerobic

73
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,000
you know and you lose the oxygen in

74
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,759
there and you start to get different

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,878
decay and stuff which you know

76
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,679
is is similar if you have soil that's

77
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,959
really wet

78
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,159
and um so we started to notice there was

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,000
this thing that would happen where we'd

80
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,519
look at the plants and we'd be like damn

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,598
it seems like

82
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,439
the beds of the plants are so big and

83
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,359
it's so hot out like the plants aren't

84
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,800
getting water at the bottom anymore or

85
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,319
the food's not reaching there because

86
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,680
we're getting the deficiencies at the

87
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,759
top of the plant

88
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,599
and the top there's food and there's a

89
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,439
lot and it's wet but what's it like down

90
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,199
below and you know sometimes you

91
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,479
somebody would like pop off a board off

92
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,318
their beds or

93
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,158
dig down in their pot to see what was

94
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,679
going on and all this different stuff

95
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:10,318
and then uh um i had a thing maybe

96
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,360
four or five years ago or something when

97
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,199
um

98
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,200
when pretty much no one had heard about

99
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,479
rude aphids and then i had root aphids

100
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,878
in my pots and

101
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,119
um it was and then i noticed you know my

102
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,479
my pots i had 65 gallon pots and i had

103
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,400
300 gallon pots

104
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,318
and the 300 gallon pot so i had root

105
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,000
aphids all over the place and the plant

106
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,518
started to look a little weird and the

107
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,759
top of the plant kind of starts to

108
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,680
yellow the leaves curl down a little bit

109
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,280
when they flower that flower develops a

110
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,799
little slower it usually winds up really

111
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,560
killer because it's technically it's

112
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,640
under fed it's not getting the nutrients

113
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,039
and a lot of times that's good

114
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,798
uh tasty weed like in jamaica what they

115
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,759
call italy when you plant it you don't

116
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,799
feed it

117
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,239
and so um we were

118
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,080
kind of like well what so what's the

119
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
deal here is it under watered over

120
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,239
watered underfed overfed is it

121
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,158
accumulating salt at the bottom

122
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,680
what the hell is going on you know and i

123
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,438
and i would see it at different people's

124
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,680
places and a lot of the time

125
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,039
it would be like one plant so yeah i

126
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,480
don't know you know whatever and

127
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,598
we'll figure it out but everything else

128
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,679
is killing it so you don't want to

129
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,598
change your program that much

130
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
um and the plants are still huge it's

131
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,039
just this little tip you're like this

132
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,720
should be the biggest buds but they're

133
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,199
not they're a little bit more lean and

134
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,080
they're not really what they should be

135
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:27,680
so um at a certain point

136
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:30,639
um i i because i have the 65s going and

137
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,319
i had the 300s going i i actually um i

138
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,600
actually hit up bamboo because

139
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,439
bamboo you know is uh he's a

140
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
smart dude he's experienced with a lot

141
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,399
of stuff and he's he's uh well educated

142
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,040
he has

143
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,120
you know a better education than me and

144
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,199
uh and a lot of experience to go along

145
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,000
with it and you know he goes to

146
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,040
davis and does classes on breeding and

147
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,399
talks to a lot of

148
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,479
a lot of people and uh and uh

149
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,519
you know sells beneficials and all this

150
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:58,959
kind of stuff so

151
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,240
i hit him up and i go you know what's

152
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,239
the deal with these things and he goes

153
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
well you want to do nematodes and then

154
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,079
he goes you know it's usually a sign if

155
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,720
they're out of control that you're over

156
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,399
watering and um before this i had

157
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,240
already kind of known a little bit about

158
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,758
the over watering causing the yellowing

159
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,759
but you get the root aphids and it's

160
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,319
exasperated it's just much

161
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,879
much higher levels of the same symptoms

162
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,199
when we

163
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,639
get root aphids and then i thought oh

164
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,680
it's the root if it's causing these

165
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,240
symptoms

166
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,000
so i noticed that my 65s that dried out

167
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,680
on a regular basis i couldn't find any

168
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,399
root aphids in them but the root aphids

169
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,680
came

170
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,478
in bags of this particular soil that i

171
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,240
bought

172
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:40,159
and it and i had used that soil for

173
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,840
for five and a half inch pots and so all

174
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,039
my starts had come from the same

175
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,638
infected soil so i

176
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,199
was having a hard time going okay the

177
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,240
65s they don't exist in

178
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,000
and the 300s they're just rampant so

179
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,680
what's the difference here

180
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,759
and luckily i had that little bit of

181
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,720
control to look at so

182
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,240
i realized that you know this because

183
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
bamboo was the one who mentioned he goes

184
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,439
you know it's usually over watering if

185
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,318
they're really out of control and i was

186
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,399
like okay

187
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,879
and um so i try all this stuff but then

188
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,318
i just

189
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,000
realized that then i see that it's

190
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,199
definitely the watering thing so i back

191
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,759
off on the water

192
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,240
well the root aphids basically disappear

193
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,360
and these symptoms disappear and

194
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,960
um and so uh

195
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,800
i'm throwing this in there because this

196
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,318
is a little bit of bonus information

197
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,520
because people don't really know this

198
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,600
about root aphids

199
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,680
root aphids don't really hang around in

200
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,080
soil that drains well like that's how it

201
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,918
works

202
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,599
in vineyards and things where they can

203
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,599
be a huge problem

204
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,039
if the soil is different then they just

205
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,759
kind of peter out

206
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,439
and they don't um keep a population and

207
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,639
they and they eventually

208
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,199
um eradicate themselves so

209
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,879
anyway um the post was basically just

210
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,400
saying hey you can buy this 40

211
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,159
water meter you stick it down to the

212
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,839
bottom of your pot and you can tell if

213
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,439
that's the reason because

214
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,038
you could be getting the same symptom

215
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,519
from it being too dry

216
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,318
as well at the bottom of your pots and

217
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,159
people who

218
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,080
really have their shit together a lot of

219
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,439
times will elevate their pots and put

220
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,399
them up on like some big

221
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,199
rock like some gravel so they can drain

222
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,359
extra well

223
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,439
and that will help with that size pot so

224
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,520
that instead of it being

225
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,519
um up against something that's wet all

226
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,159
the time there's air underneath them and

227
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,839
you know the

228
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,680
kind of thing about fabric pots is they

229
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,918
cause air pruning so your roots hit the

230
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,079
side and then they branch extra

231
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,240
and if you have a regular pot made out

232
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,758
of plastic and you go to like like in a

233
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,400
seven gallon or something you go to pick

234
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,919
it up

235
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,679
you'll notice there's not a lot of roots

236
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,598
around the stock the roots have

237
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,800
circled around the outside but in a

238
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,519
fabric pot

239
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
or an air pot or a root builder pot what

240
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,240
happens

241
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
is they reach the outside and then they

242
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,360
branch

243
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,800
and so um by actually putting them up on

244
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,720
some rock then you gain

245
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,160
that same benefit at the very bottom a

246
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,919
little bit more because they

247
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,479
they root prune what happens is they hit

248
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:03,439
the air and it sends them a signal that

249
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,120
don't go any further you know branch out

250
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,719
and they bush off the same way as if

251
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,319
you're to top a plant for people who are

252
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,240
familiar with what happens when you when

253
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,598
you top your plants you know

254
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,038
um so anyway the post was just telling

255
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,279
people like hey

256
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,959
if it looks like this get a water meter

257
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,038
a moisture meter because it's likely

258
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,839
you're over watering and then sometimes

259
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,360
you discover

260
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,359
like you'll have you'll have plants

261
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,479
and and you'll notice like one leaf will

262
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,879
droop

263
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,080
and then another leaf will droop and

264
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,759
you'll be like the whole plant looks

265
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
beautiful but there's like five leaves

266
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,958
and

267
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,360
that are drooping and it'll come and go

268
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,518
and you can't figure out what's going on

269
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,918
and a lot of times what will happen is

270
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,159
you have in the roots you have

271
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,439
you have dry spots that are in there and

272
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,120
you can't tell you

273
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
take the moisture meter and you probe it

274
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,639
around and you go okay

275
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,839
i'm giving it enough water but right

276
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,000
over here in this little

277
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,160
area it's not getting enough water so

278
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,759
you need to kind of make a little

279
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,838
make a little uh a little recessed area

280
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,600
and let the water go there extra to even

281
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,360
it out then you'll notice it goes away

282
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,120
and

283
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,959
so anyway just watering it's funny

284
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,720
because you can be super experienced

285
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,039
working in one way but then you go to

286
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,480
try to grow these monster plants

287
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,879
or you hook up drip and you're used to

288
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,399
hand watering or you change emitters or

289
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,080
you don't realize it but where your

290
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,559
emitter goes in the line

291
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
um there's a leak so you're getting

292
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,119
triple the water

293
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,879
and you don't know it because you

294
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,039
haven't been inspecting it all the time

295
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,958
because you just figure your stuff works

296
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:39,519
um so it was just a heads up to people

297
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:43,359
that watering winds up being

298
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,080
um really although it seems like

299
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,519
the simplest part of growing something

300
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,480
give it water

301
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,600
the water levels are huge and um people

302
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,639
who monitor it

303
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,399
um really scientifically you know they

304
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,159
they let that they let it swing they go

305
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,839
okay we take the moisture up to 80 we

306
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,838
let it drop to 20 and

307
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,920
you know in veg you do it different and

308
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,680
in bloom you do it different and i'm not

309
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,199
somebody who does everything monitored

310
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,000
really carefully like that

311
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,440
but i do like to monitor it well enough

312
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,360
that i'm not having

313
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,560
i'm not taking a big hit you know i

314
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,278
don't grow

315
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,518
under gavita's with least space so it

316
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,519
doesn't really matter to me if my plant

317
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,039
gets this slightly different yield but

318
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,639
what i can't have is just

319
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,639
um is a uh um

320
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,039
you know a failure where the plant is

321
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:35,278
just all messed up you know

322
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,278
so uh that's what the post was

323
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,278
it's a good summary so

324
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,679
this is uh you had posted something

325
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,039
about

326
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:50,479
tobacco right yeah and so

327
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,759
actually i think steve razor dropped off

328
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,120
but these are from

329
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,639
seeds he gave me and so i have like this

330
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,879
little one

331
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:03,759
and then

332
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,759
like this one

333
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,679
and i love i love so what i love about

334
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,719
these things is at night

335
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,199
they get totally erect and they just

336
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,000
like

337
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,680
all the leaves shoot straight up and

338
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,559
then in the daytime

339
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,679
they all just droop and get super lazy

340
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:29,838
like

341
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:29,838
lounging which is kind of interesting

342
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:39,199
um yeah i've noticed uh what's trippy

343
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:41,119
is that uh i have mine

344
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,240
in an area where they're shaded for part

345
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,600
of the day

346
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,919
and then it's like they um

347
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,959
adjust their their um

348
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,199
their uh level of water

349
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,399
uh uptake and transpiration so it's like

350
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,639
you put them in the

351
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,159
i have them in the shade and then

352
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,720
they're like really happy

353
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,679
and then the sun hits them and then they

354
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,120
start to wilt

355
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,719
and but then if i put them out where

356
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,679
they get the sun really early in the

357
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,160
morning

358
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,439
um then it's like they can stay more

359
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,719
level and they know it's it's like

360
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,800
they're ready for it

361
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,320
and so then they just look normal um

362
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,838
all of the time and that was something

363
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,120
that i didn't i didn't really realize

364
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,720
and it happened kind of with all the

365
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,240
different plants that i had

366
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,079
that were in the shade and then the sun

367
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,600
hit them when it was already intense

368
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,679
which was kind of like

369
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,278
pulling up almost like pulling a plant

370
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,838
out of a greenhouse

371
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,720
um when it's hot out they want to freak

372
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,040
out a little bit

373
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:42,320
and stuff um can i add to uh

374
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,719
the uh the over watering thing so

375
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,560
yeah really good point to make you know

376
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,120
over watering is probably the

377
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,159
most common mistake made by growers you

378
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,519
know from expert

379
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,360
to beginner it's just really easy to do

380
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,200
and for outdoor growers

381
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,399
when i'm when i have like new people on

382
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,800
a farm that i'm running

383
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,320
and i'm you know trying to take people

384
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,559
with very little experience

385
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,560
and try to cram all my experience into

386
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,159
them you know it's it's really you just

387
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,278
take everything you simplify

388
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,799
you know in the springtime it's colder

389
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:13,679
out your plants have smaller root

390
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,559
systems

391
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,120
they need a lot less water you know as

392
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,278
they grow

393
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,799
you know they need more but the biggest

394
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,240
indicator that i always tell people

395
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,759
because you know what jackson's talking

396
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,759
about where you see that you know i've

397
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,639
seen gardens where people have 10 pound

398
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,399
plants

399
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,839
and it's just one half of the plant or

400
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,600
one little branch

401
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,000
and if they don't catch it early and

402
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,159
start treating it with the right type of

403
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,440
you know like a nematode or other like

404
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,319
inoculants

405
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,600
um you know you can lose those plants

406
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,959
you know and you see it pretty commonly

407
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,560
so the indicator that i always tell

408
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,559
people when i'm teaching them is

409
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,559
underwatering and over watering both

410
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,958
have the same signs and the leaves

411
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,638
as your leaves are droops right and so

412
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,319
the only difference it's really common

413
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,198
sense and really basic is

414
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,800
if your leaves are over watered and you

415
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,198
feel right there in the leaf stem

416
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,078
you're going to feel that it's rigid and

417
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,559
then it's filled with

418
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,000
water inside it's nice and stiff and if

419
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,838
your plants are underwater

420
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,278
your leaves are still drooping and this

421
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,959
is going to be all fucking weak because

422
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,958
there's no fucking water in there

423
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,958
and you can feel it pretty easily so

424
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,119
that's kind of like a beginner's tip to

425
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,958
to seeing if you've over watered or

426
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,320
underwater they have the same look

427
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,879
but it's just as simple as seeing if

428
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,480
there's moisture inside the stem

429
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,720
and another thing that i think helps

430
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,759
guide people in learning

431
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,720
how not to over water is if you

432
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,519
underwater

433
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,120
and you're vigilant and you pay good

434
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,000
attention to detail in your plants

435
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,278
you can just add more water this is fine

436
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,120
if you over water

437
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,879
you have to fucking let it dry out

438
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,759
before you can do anything about it

439
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,278
so it's better to underwater than over

440
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,240
water if you had to make one of those

441
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:49,519
mistakes

442
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,039
and a good grower is going to be

443
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,720
vigilant pay a lot of attention to

444
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:53,360
detail catch it before it becomes a

445
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,920
problem

446
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,120
simply have more water if you continue

447
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,360
to over water

448
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,198
it will lead to you know potential pest

449
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,560
problems like the root aphids but

450
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,240
everything else from

451
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,919
viruses and really anything that can

452
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,919
harm a plant

453
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,360
from ph fluctuations and lack of

454
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,879
nutrient uptake

455
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,278
so yeah over watering big common mistake

456
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:26,958
and it's just as simple as just knowing

457
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:29,039
what to look for

458
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,039
you
