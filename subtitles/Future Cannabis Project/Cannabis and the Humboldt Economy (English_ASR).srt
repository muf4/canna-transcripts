00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:16,669
[Music]

2
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:19,278
everything's getting flushed out with

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,740
licensing and so yeah we're gonna see

4
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,929
another flush out once the temporary

5
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:26,538
licenses go away so yeah that's going to

6
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:27,108
be an interesting landscape come early

7
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:29,060
next year

8
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:30,080
yeah and that's I think it's another

9
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:32,240
thing that's talking to a few growers

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,189
this morning one of them sitting on

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,440
about 325 acres up in Santa Barbara

12
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:39,289
County near Lompoc and then the other

13
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:41,628
guy has Humboldt has Humboldt ranch up

14
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:44,390
right outside of Eureka clearly right

15
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:45,799
next to a airport and it's interesting

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,920
the two different conversations because

17
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,939
what's going on in Humboldt just a crazy

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,010
crazy will just say that I won't you

19
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:53,780
saying customers you know versus how

20
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,149
quick and efficient their their being

21
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,829
with licensing any and permits to in a

22
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:00,530
place like Santa Barbara County versus

23
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,628
LA where it's just been crazy these guys

24
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,579
are do you know this because you're one

25
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:06,500
you're the one saving the day from the

26
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:08,539
growers that can't grow yeah you know

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,938
even in Humble we have I'm in three

28
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,860
different jurisdictions I have

29
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:14,389
unincorporated area Humboldt County city

30
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:15,560
of Arcadia so if you have a building in

31
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,780
Arcata that's different

32
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,579
and then there's Eureka so now all three

33
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,099
municipalities are on Eureka was the

34
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:24,379
last one to come on board but they're

35
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:26,359
moving the fastest their processing

36
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:28,548
permit after permit and so I've heard

37
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,920
that it's really interesting to see how

38
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:35,540
the local municipalities either

39
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,810
roadblock or propel economy I mean at

40
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:41,960
this point it's it's real estate jobs

41
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:44,899
you know disposable income from humble

42
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:46,849
your your boutique shops their business

43
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:49,340
is down but it's getting harder find

44
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:50,118
vacant real estate housing markets doing

45
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,560
really well

46
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:54,019
grocery stores are doing really well

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,909
yeah employment is definitely on the

48
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:57,560
store because you go through you drive

49
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,170
by one of these cannabis facilities and

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,240
there are people there there are bars in

51
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,280
the parking lot because especially when

52
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,919
you come to packaging and processing

53
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,229
material I mean it takes a workforce so

54
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,900
no it's nice to see people don't get

55
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,799
that Eureka for several years has not

56
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,379
been a thriving

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,750
topless I mean when when all the timber

58
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:19,310
kind of pulled out of Northern

59
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,840
California by Northern California we

60
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,680
mean essentially north of San Francisco

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,870
or Santa Rosa more specifically you know

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,150
Trinity humble Eureka County Lake County

63
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,039
even you know into Nevada County north

64
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,920
of Sacramento that kind of saw this

65
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,769
constant decline of populous of jobs of

66
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,780
opportunity and this really is and

67
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,010
that's where again a played-out turn but

68
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,379
that's where I think like the Green Rush

69
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:45,049
replies like this is injecting the

70
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:46,699
monies and the people and everything

71
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,560
back into societies that are kind of

72
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,729
forgotten about yeah I bet people don't

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,240
realize that's a big portion of this

74
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:51,979
state

75
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,810
everything's it's just from San

76
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:55,519
Francisco to San Diego it's like there's

77
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,789
a whole other side of the state from San

78
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,530
Francisco to Medford you know so but I

79
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:02,449
mean I think I'm in a further like a

80
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,479
Eureka is pretty damn impressive there's

81
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:07,729
a lot of drug I mean yeah the industry's

82
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,259
gonna help clean up the city but would

83
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,969
be even better than if we can use the

84
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:13,519
cannabis to help get people off the

85
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:16,099
opiates get wonderful the meth and all

86
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,130
that stuff and so hopefully besides just

87
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:22,099
the economic base value of it that we

88
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:24,289
can do a social economic improvement in

89
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,539
terms of let's get people on more

90
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:29,479
cannabis and less opiates and less meth

91
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:31,429
and all the nasty drugs that kind of

92
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:33,019
make it an exit drug right we hate to

93
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,780
call the drug I think a lot of us Pierce

94
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,520
but honestly that's what really never

95
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,800
mind Daryl gates and the whole dare

96
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,409
movement from 1983 which again both of

97
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,550
us grew up with put that to bed and say

98
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:45,349
no if anything if we're going to call

99
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,780
the drug this is an exit drug because to

100
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:50,840
your point the opioid issue is an

101
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,400
epidemic in every every corner of this

102
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,620
country I mean just coming from that

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,000
show in Utah I mentioned they're having

104
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,099
problems there and they're seeing this

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,439
as a solution not just a solution for

106
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:02,090
cancer survivors like myself or for

107
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,939
children with Grandma epileptic seizure

108
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,289
issues I mean this really does it's a

109
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:08,780
miracle plan I call it that and I don't

110
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:11,150
know you know I'm totally serious about

111
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,519
it yeah you talked to like Aussies I

112
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,500
know max stone this great guy from the

113
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,910
hemp embassy down in Australia they

114
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,709
always preach about freeing the plant

115
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,239
and again at first I was like I'm free

116
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,040
the plant really I'm like that's true

117
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,869
they do need to free the plants

118
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,819
so much opportunities it makes sense

119
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,170
what you're saying all the Rastas caught

120
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:29,569
the healing of the nation's

121
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,580
yeah yeah yeah yeah they're on to

122
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:42,050
something that was

123
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:42,050
