1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,359
California Michigan I think represent

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,068
like kind of the most interesting place

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,719
because they had you know really well

4
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:07,919
entrenched cannabis markets the last

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,289
four or five years but they know it's

6
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,939
been kind of a gray market so now that

7
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:13,169
we have a codified market and Michigan's

8
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:14,609
making their transition now and

9
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:18,240
California had been doing it you know

10
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:20,039
since Jan 1 last year there's a lot of

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,989
companies that are kind of making this

12
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,670
you know transition from A to B and I

13
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,719
think where we are right now is kind of

14
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,220
in this like you know think of as a

15
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,339
baton pass Lee and during a relay race

16
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,570
where you were over here doing prop 215

17
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,098
and now you're trying to get to

18
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,109
amendment 64 and you're trying to figure

19
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,000
out the regs and you know the the new

20
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:37,200
regs in California just launched so I

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,929
think a lot of people were waiting to

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,399
see what would happen there but there is

23
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,988
a lot of growth with new companies in

24
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,789
California so a lot of the old companies

25
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:46,169
haven't made the transition they've

26
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,850
tried there's time but they will do it

27
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,039
successfully or they've decided they'd

28
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,179
rather stay in the in the shadows and do

29
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,340
what they did for the last 20 or 30

30
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,369
years which is you know feed an illicit

31
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,180
market that largely goes out of state

32
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:58,738
Michigan is going through the same thing

33
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:59,878
right now so you know those are two

34
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:01,649
markets where there was actually still

35
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:03,750
real opportunity to open a new canvas

36
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,629
business many other markets let's say in

37
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,950
New York or Florida or Illinois the

38
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:09,599
markets already been carved up as an

39
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,650
oligopoly it's been state regulated

40
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,579
where the you know the whoever runs it

41
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,049
you know whether it's Health and Human

42
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,459
Services or the Department of Revenue

43
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,990
has said you know here's the licenses

44
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,839
we're not gonna create any more for the

45
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:23,368
near future so if you're not in you're

46
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,109
out and you know the best you can hope

47
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:26,129
for is you get a job working for one of

48
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,109
those behemoths that we talked about

49
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,328
earlier but in California and you think

50
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:32,609
about like you know the LA area or LA

51
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:35,339
through San Diego you get 21 million

52
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:37,078
people in a largely unregulated canvas

53
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,909
market that are trying to figure out you

54
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,459
know what's next and can you start

55
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,680
something that becomes the next Cresco

56
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,269
and the answer is that there's still a

57
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,490
chance you know you need a lot of

58
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:48,810
capital to to enter now but if you've

59
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:50,969
got deep pockets and you've got a really

60
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,040
good idea and you've got someone that

61
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,390
really understands branding then there's

62
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,340
a chance right now to enter the market

63
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,468
greenfield and still make an impact

64
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,118
where it wouldn't be in either a very

65
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:02,218
mature market like Colorado or a very

66
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,359
regulated market like New York the

67
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:06,539
collar on Washington might be the best

68
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,699
examples of you know true free market

69
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,430
capitalism at work where you know you're

70
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,750
gonna see a massive wave of new entrants

71
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,189
and you're going to see consolidation

72
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,620
you

73
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:18,259
she hit equilibrium and then operated

74
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,789
steady-state going forward California is

75
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:21,709
in that place right now where it's kind

76
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:23,509
of having that massive wave come up and

77
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,909
you're watching and unfortunately what's

78
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:27,799
gonna be tremendous amount over building

79
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:29,539
in this industry so if you look at what

80
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,150
the BCC and the CDF a have already

81
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:34,009
licensed in California from a

82
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,870
consumption standpoint you know you are

83
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:38,030
our supply is gonna be probably seven to

84
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,439
ten X demand over the next couple of

85
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,030
years you're gonna see a lot of people

86
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,800
unfortunately go out of business because

87
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,509
you know so many people tried to migrate

88
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,310
from the illicit market where their

89
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:48,979
address will market of who they sold to

90
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,020
was all the us now they're saying okay

91
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:52,129
well you get to get legal get legal but

92
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,750
that means now you can we sell to

93
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,889
California so you went from three

94
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,479
hundred thirty million people as an

95
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,849
addressable market to thirty nine

96
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,590
million people and so all these you know

97
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,359
northern counties that have tried to

98
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,640
migrate people into the the legal side

99
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,210
in many ways all they've done is just

100
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,009
created a dearth of available product

101
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,320
and you have tons of new entrants that

102
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:14,060
are opening up in places like Adelanto

103
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,379
and Desert Hot Springs and Coachella and

104
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,699
you've got this massive wave that's

105
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:18,530
happening in Santa Barbara County around

106
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,819
Carpinteria and then also what's

107
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,439
happening in Salinas and Monterey were

108
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:24,530
the repurposing old greenhouses that

109
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,359
we're about to have you know as I said

110
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,979
ten times as much canvases as we know

111
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,200
how to deal with in a market that

112
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:31,369
ultimately at steady state might be ten

113
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,280
billion dollars a year across the

114
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,539
counter so if you're gonna enter the

115
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,930
market if you're gonna enter in

116
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:40,789
California you have to be good it's not

117
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,290
just on the cultivation side it's on the

118
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,599
processing side it's on the branded

119
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:46,789
product side it's on the retail side

120
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,900
it's a hyper competitive marketplace but

121
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:49,429
the people that succeed in the

122
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,599
California market ultimately I think

123
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,480
would be the most successful companies

124
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,250
in you know in canvas in the country and

125
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,289
I think as Federal legalization happens

126
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,669
then the expectation is California will

127
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:59,840
start supplying the rest of the country

128
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,909
for canvas the way it traditionally

129
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,650
always has it'll just do it now from the

130
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,389
standpoint of we've got the best quality

131
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,280
we've got the the lowest cost of

132
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:08,988
production we've got the most robust

133
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,449
immature long-standing tradition of

134
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:13,909
understanding canvas culture branding is

135
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:15,919
la centric you know or New York centric

136
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:17,600
but the in in my mind there's absolutely

137
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,029
no purpose or no reason to ever grow

138
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,410
canvas in Minnesota or in Wisconsin why

139
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,449
would you ever produce like in a place

140
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,210
where there's massive fluctuations and

141
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,038
temperatures massive

142
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:28,239
energy costs associated with it when

143
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:30,310
you've got the beautiful California

144
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,740
sunshine that you know can produce in a

145
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:45,519
mix like greenhouse at a fraction of the

146
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:47,620
cost out of much higher quality for a

147
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,998
long time was finding someone to take

148
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,860
their weight you know these guys are

149
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:52,569
producing so much like some of these

150
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,979
facilities are you know three four acres

151
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:55,449
under glass you know some of the

152
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:56,978
operators might have ten of those

153
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,930
facilities they might be thirty or forty

154
00:04:56,978 --> 00:05:00,250
acres under glass when you think about

155
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,560
you know what that means in a facility

156
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,319
that's turning four or five harvests a

157
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,240
year its massive massive amounts of

158
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:08,710
weight coming out so those guys weren't

159
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,300
going after the upper end of the

160
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,878
spectrum they're going after let's just

161
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,978
be you know you're your producer your

162
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,689
mids or your regs yeah and let's just

163
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:18,158
blast it let's let's find someone that

164
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:19,659
wants to take it let's blast the entire

165
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:21,490
harvest let's put it in you know like

166
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:23,288
either you know down to distillate or

167
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,588
isolate or least get it to the clear and

168
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:28,269
you know send it out for vape carts so

169
00:05:26,588 --> 00:05:29,680
it's you know these guys like we're

170
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:31,028
trying to find buyers I'll say I'll take

171
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,319
a thousand pounds at a time and

172
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:33,639
oftentimes they're selling it without

173
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,468
even doing any trimming without any

174
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,860
curing just flash-frozen

175
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:41,288
out the door to you know the larger

176
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,939
buyers but now those buyers are starting

177
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:45,310
to say we've got our our farms we're

178
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:46,330
working with people are scrambling right

179
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,098
now they're all trying to figure out

180
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:49,418
who's going to take my weight and if you

181
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,250
know they don't take it then what

182
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:52,688
happens to it you know we just put all

183
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,459
this capital into our capex and

184
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:56,588
infrastructure and now we're going to

185
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:58,269
think about you know can we actually

186
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:59,889
survive on what we've built or do we

187
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:02,198
need to scale back and you know stop any

188
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:03,879
additional infrastructure build and all

189
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,330
the temp license has received from the

190
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:09,580
CDFA back in 2017 or an eighteen you

191
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:11,139
know do we now not apply for an annual

192
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:12,430
license as a result of knowing that

193
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,668
there's no addressable market to sell

194
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,668
into

195
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:22,569
[Music]

196
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,189
the ideal situation is you have a farm

197
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:27,379
some of it goes to your own host brand

198
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:31,339
there then marketing promoting some of

199
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:35,709
it goes with third-party buyer so you

200
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:39,978
see a lot of like a race to build brands

201
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:41,269
I haven't seen as much as Santa Barbara

202
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:42,829
I've seen a scene at where they're

203
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,839
combining forces with people that are

204
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:46,219
brand builders more out of LA where you

205
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:48,228
know you're so close you're 90 miles

206
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,610
from from point A to point B that

207
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:51,288
they're say okay let's let's really

208
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,879
think about how do we hold margin you

209
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:55,459
know it's okay we might not have the

210
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,810
highest quality inputs but if we reduce

211
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:58,038
it down to a distillate anyway it

212
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,418
doesn't really matter we're not talking

213
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,668
about a Terrapin profile or a flavonoid

214
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:05,899
profile we're not talking about you know

215
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:07,969
how much THC CBD CBN is in there so from

216
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:09,019
that standpoint you know can we sell to

217
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,729
someone that's going to put it into a

218
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:12,978
topical or sell for an edible or

219
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:14,899
something else where the branded product

220
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:17,240
is going to hold price that's kind of

221
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:19,008
where the shotgun marriages are starting

222
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,418
to happen and you're starting to see

223
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,500
people there saying I just want to work

224
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:23,379
with the following groups because I

225
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,848
think they've got the best path to

226
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:28,788
top-notch branding and if we can share

227
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:30,019
in the economics were a lot happier than

228
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:33,848
we would be if we were just selling as

229
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:33,848
as a wholesale producer of flour

230
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:40,189
we've seen with cultivators because for

231
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,819
example I talked to one from Humble who

232
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:46,189
had never done fresh frozen before and

233
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,019
that allocated 25% of this entire

234
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:50,660
harvest to it this year so it's like

235
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:53,448
you're not just a flower producer you're

236
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:57,160
in the oil game you're in the Nessa so

237
00:07:53,449 --> 00:08:02,270
how do you see sort of cultivators

238
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:04,970
diversifying their product mix renders

239
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:06,469
in you just nailed one of them in the

240
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,910
fact is that people are doing that now

241
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,410
we're doing as a hedge you know and

242
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,030
they're also where it used to be like

243
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,250
let's try to get top dollar and you know

244
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:15,349
bleed it out 20 30 50 pounds at a time

245
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,459
you know send it back east a lot of

246
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,510
those same drawers now we're saying all

247
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:21,529
right I'll find someone that's going to

248
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:23,599
put outputs contract on my entire

249
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:25,039
harvest or I'm gonna you know take 25

250
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,720
percent of the harvest I'm gonna worry

251
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,370
about you know trying to get it out over

252
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,720
the next two or three months and just

253
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,788
you know sell it out so the same way

254
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,370
that like you know call ten years ago

255
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:35,750
when guys first started doing like death

256
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,429
harvest you know the first black box

257
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,719
harvests they're doing as a hedge

258
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,189
against making sure that you know they

259
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,890
don't lose their whole harvest to you

260
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,300
know either late season molds mildews

261
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,220
and you know other things caused by rain

262
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:48,109
or cold weather you know now the hedges

263
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,690
do we have someone L take 25 30 percent

264
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,519
of our harvest right out of the gate the

265
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,230
other trend I'm seeing is groups really

266
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,399
working with distributors they think are

267
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,250
we gonna be able to get their product to

268
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,958
market whether it's labeling their

269
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,309
product as someone else's so you know

270
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,509
you look at what can Destin's done in

271
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:04,579
the California market and have done a

272
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:06,830
really nice job of buying up other

273
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,300
people's uh harvests you know they go

274
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,790
out there and sniff around for who's got

275
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:12,049
the highest quality farms and then

276
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:13,639
saying we'll take everything you know

277
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:15,679
we'll brand it ask and s it will make

278
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,939
sure the turf profile is largely similar

279
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,889
to what we're putting out for product

280
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,300
you know a thought to be a different

281
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:22,429
term you know profile let's go out and

282
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:22,899
source that so they're doing great job

283
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,338
of that

284
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:26,179
Mikey up it flow comments doing a great

285
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:28,279
job with that as well

286
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,539
saying okay let's let's put out tons of

287
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:31,070
product into the flow counter name but

288
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:32,659
we're gonna aggregate you know 50

289
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,370
different farms to do it

290
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:35,990
the guys the honeydew farms are doing a

291
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,889
really nice job of getting product out

292
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,480
you know so it's the cultivation side

293
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:43,789
still powers the industry you know you

294
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,740
keep hearing all this negativity around

295
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:47,339
price compression and commodification of

296
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,769
a flower of

297
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,450
cultivation but ultimately every product

298
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:54,470
that we sell in this industry is

299
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:57,870
predicated on the producers of a biomass

300
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,279
so for for those guys you know finding

301
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,779
the alliances finding who you want to

302
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,250
team up with a lot of its based on

303
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,449
either a the processor you're gonna work

304
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,860
with a fee on the distributor you're

305
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,910
gonna work with because ultimately

306
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,350
they're the ones that are gonna be able

307
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:08,459
to move your product for you better than

308
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,080
you can do it yourself unless you're

309
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:23,070
just really savvy at

310
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:24,690
you know logistics and distribution who

311
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,160
are kind of power players that are

312
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,930
emerging in different parts of the

313
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,959
supply chain so you know you just

314
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:32,370
mentioned some brands like comment and

315
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,830
essa and that's sort of the public

316
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,870
facing brandy so you got a shell now

317
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,330
about like the distribution players

318
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,669
who's emerging and distribution who is

319
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:45,000
uh you know who's making moves on the

320
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:51,569
retail side to build up a retail brand

321
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,159
right yeah so on the let's separate the

322
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,570
industry into you know six or seven

323
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,339
different parts you've got the the

324
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,230
flower producers you've got the the guys

325
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,850
are doing the vape carts you've got the

326
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,700
distributors you've got the retailers

327
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,290
you've got the you know some processes

328
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,540
or I should call them you know branded

329
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:09,149
products guys and there's best and breed

330
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,709
you know at each level yeah I think for

331
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:11,970
flour producers there's some like you

332
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,620
know look the canned essence to the flow

333
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,750
Cana has to have the big reputations but

334
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,220
there's craft guys like Palomar craft

335
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,980
cannabis in San Diego that's just

336
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,269
absolute light sound quality who is in

337
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,879
the process right now if you know going

338
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:25,139
through a licensing with the state so

339
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,700
there's other other groups that are you

340
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:29,100
know really boutique thinking of the way

341
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,480
microbrews are that are producing really

342
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,490
really high quality that you can think

343
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,269
of on the distribution side you know

344
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,500
coming out of the gate everyone's

345
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,600
talking about what River was going to do

346
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,610
with Harvey I was going to do they've

347
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,200
since been acquired by by origin house

348
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,529
and they're in the process of kind of

349
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,060
you know revamping but you know I from a

350
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:49,620
logistics standpoint those guys came out

351
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,149
of southern wanting spirits there you

352
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,480
know a talented team and they've they've

353
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:56,039
got good processes a gentleman named

354
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,629
Ross Haley who used to run general

355
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,009
hydroponics in the Hydra space has

356
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:01,809
the new distribution company that I

357
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:04,240
can't remember the name of it but Ross

358
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:05,829
has been just a powerhouse and

359
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,970
everything he's ever touched so if I

360
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,020
were to say who do I'd knock that

361
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,730
against I don't bet against Ross there's

362
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:15,789
uh there's some other distributors I

363
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:19,690
think they've done a nice job in in

364
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:20,860
NorCal trying to save snow in Pacific it

365
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,040
could be one that's done a pretty nice

366
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,009
job in the vape cart market you know

367
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:30,689
there's there's quite a few of them in

368
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:30,689
the heavy hitters the brass knuckles the

369
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:37,690
let's see who else exciting I think is

370
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,460
uh there's probably five or six that are

371
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,010
that are battling out for for market

372
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,330
share pretty well but on the vape

373
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:44,529
current market you know I think that

374
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,629
there's some people that are doing

375
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:47,860
really really unique things that will

376
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:49,330
ultimately probably be more successful

377
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,220
than the guys are actually just pushing

378
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,680
through just large quantity so I think

379
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,120
dosis those doses starting has done a

380
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,009
really really nice job in up from

381
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,570
branding and when you think about where

382
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:02,529
this markets going where you think you

383
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,970
know you can expect to see something

384
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,860
that resonates across multiple markets

385
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,170
you know it's gonna end up looking like

386
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,480
doses packs I think it's done a really

387
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:13,870
nice job of taking their brand before

388
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,519
the era for the after the PAX era and

389
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,440
having other people you know license

390
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,519
with them to fill their carts so they're

391
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,710
still you know even though they don't

392
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,059
directly touch the the industry they've

393
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,440
done a really great job of saying we're

394
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,309
going to pick the boutique farms that we

395
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,840
think are going to produce the best

396
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,119
product that's gonna represent the packs

397
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,440
name the best so that's you know two

398
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,850
different ways to attack you know the

399
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,850
same thing and then there's all the guys

400
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,200
like the heavy hitters of the kingpins

401
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,550
that have gone out and just said okay

402
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,900
let's just fill as many cars as we

403
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,089
possibly can with the biomass were

404
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:45,490
producing or that we're buying and also

405
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:47,259
market and then retail I'm a fan of

406
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,029
Marty's up at harvest in San Francisco

407
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:53,620
and he does a nice job from you know

408
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:59,189
building a really nice store yeah I

409
00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:01,779
can't give Mad Men credit just I know

410
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,860
you know there's a couple groups in San

411
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:04,179
Diego that I think you're making a

412
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,139
planet that you know trying to do a

413
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:07,389
rollup of sorts

414
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:09,279
I know lighthouses as making a play for

415
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,939
you know trying to put a bunch of stores

416
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,009
together

417
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,570
the retail side where it's too early to

418
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:15,799
tell someone's gonna come in someone's

419
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,120
ain't comin product amount of Industry

420
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,129
and just throw a ton of money at the

421
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,480
California market and say let's put a

422
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:22,519
hundred stores together let's be the

423
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,620
first many people retail experience that

424
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,480
exists in the California market and it's

425
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,860
gonna be as you know it'll be no

426
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,110
different than Chipotle or any other

427
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:43,100
brands you recognize that it's - no

428
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:45,139
terrific combination the - I mean build

429
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,759
versus buy it's much cheaper to build if

430
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,590
you can you know if you can find a new

431
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,419
town that's just opening up and say okay

432
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:53,030
I mean for instance Los Angeles has had

433
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:54,259
the same 135 or so retails that they've

434
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,759
licensed for a long time

435
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:57,950
and now there's all this talk about you

436
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,149
know adding new licenses and that's a

437
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,910
question of who it's gonna go to is

438
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:04,009
gonna go to to minority owners or is it

439
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:05,899
going to go just an open market if you

440
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:07,909
can get one of the new wave of LA

441
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:09,529
licenses I think that you know that's a

442
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:11,029
pretty coveted license

443
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:12,230
same thing with San Diego same thing

444
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:14,600
with San Jose is anything in San

445
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,889
Francisco but I think it's also a lot of

446
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,509
the smaller towns and you forget that

447
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:19,580
there's 39 million people in California

448
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:22,189
and just from my drive to San Diego to

449
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,020
here today in LA I passed by 30 towns

450
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,520
with populations of over 80,000 people

451
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,769
you know any one of those in any other

452
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,809
state would be a marquee market so you

453
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:31,429
know can you get a market where you know

454
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:33,559
for instance in San Diego Oceanside is

455
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:36,439
just opening up Oceanside's 100,000

456
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,879
person town so in those markets as

457
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,500
they're opening I think that the savvy

458
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,970
groups are going to say okay let's get

459
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,529
in there let's put our lobbying team to

460
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,440
work let's let's hire a case Street

461
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:47,000
let's hire five corners of marketing or

462
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,380
five growth strategies and let's let's

463
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,450
get the work done so we can actually

464
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:53,029
open a new market and then once you have

465
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,020
then let's get let's take as many you

466
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:55,639
know touching once you can't

467
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,169
and then the marquee markets where

468
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,370
they're already kind of given out then

469
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:01,039
we'll acquire and you know we'll

470
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,570
probably overpay but we'll pay 5x

471
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,860
revenue or something like that that you

472
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,590
know ultimately we think is worth it

473
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,450
because it's given us a location that is

474
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,950
you know so recognizable it's like

475
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,710
having you know a nerve as on Fifth

476
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:15,550
Avenue like you have to have the marquee

477
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,550
sort of anchor stores

478
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:21,299
we settle data like trends and things

479
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,740
like that have you been lost and we're

480
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:24,359
not going to this is like you think of

481
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,399
the brass knuckles the heavy hitters if

482
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,240
you think of like the big pen market

483
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:34,078
like our company is able to is it kind

484
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,659
of a race to like $35 cartridges or our

485
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:39,628
company is able to charge a premium for

486
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:41,549
brand-name because every everybody is

487
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:46,550
probably pitching dispensary therapy and

488
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:49,669
every day yeah so so how do you survive

489
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:51,838
why it's just being flooded that's

490
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:54,059
because of the name of the game now is

491
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,240
uh is buying shell space you know if

492
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:59,429
you're a really smart high-volume retail

493
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,899
store then that retail store you know if

494
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:02,969
they've got 50 people competing for the

495
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,338
same shell space and quality is roughly

496
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,288
commensurate then how do you pick a

497
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:09,178
versus B versus C and who's gonna pay

498
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:10,078
for that shell space you know it's no

499
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,509
different than it is in traditional

500
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,918
retail but now it's kind of a step up

501
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:15,298
and you look at what certain companies

502
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,159
are doing in the galleries dosis does an

503
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:18,959
example they're doing this store within

504
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:21,689
a store you know they'll say okay we

505
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,650
want guaranteed this much sell space so

506
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:24,538
you don't we're gonna man it with their

507
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,370
own person will still work you know in

508
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:27,599
conjunction with the retail but we want

509
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:28,949
to make sure that our guys there all the

510
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,849
time it has a store within a store and

511
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,610
they're teaching people about our

512
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:33,899
product and that's happening you know on

513
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:34,979
the flower side the tufting on the vape

514
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,900
side is happening in the brain and

515
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,429
peroxide you're certainly seeing guys

516
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,530

517
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:41,580
entire day at dispensaries now to you

518

to compete in the branded Mart branded

526
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:56,759
product side of this market right now

527
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,319
you absolutely have to do it you

528
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,230
absolutely have to work with the

529
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,428
retailer's either by having just a great

530
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,110
relationship where you know that your

531
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:06,538
product sells through so well that they

532
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:08,069
have to carry you or if you want them to

533
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:10,558
carry you you're willing to you know

534
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:12,029
step up your game and find a way that

535
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:13,649
they're they're gonna notice you above

536
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:16,339
the rest and usually that's yeah that's

537
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,340
money talking

538
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:20,939
come from a lot of people talk about

539
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,630
beverages right you didn't do that

540
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,769
similarly as a high-growth does

541
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,280
everybody want to be drinking our

542
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:30,720
cannabis beverages great question and

543
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,009
this is something I deal with beverage

544
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,240
analysts all the time in investment

545
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:34,619
banks and you know when they asked me

546
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,970
like it's so funny because ever since

547
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,339
Constellation Brands made their

548
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,870
investment into canopy everyone's asking

549
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:41,519
about it now Molson Coors has gotten

550
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,808
involved and now Heineken Lagunitas has

551
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,220
gotten involved and you actually have a

552
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:47,190
Heineken Lagunitas product in the

553
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,600
Southern California market so you know

554
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,970
beverages like right now it makes up

555
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:54,538
like 1% of the industry it's such a

556
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:56,759
small category by comparison else but

557
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:58,169
when you think about Las Vegas as a

558
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,400
market or you think about Denver as a

559
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:03,230
market right now and you think that you

560
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,940
know the new wave now is for on-premises

561
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,409
consumption whereas before you know you

562
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,548
bought as a dispensary and you took it

563
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:10,320
home and there's restrictions you

564
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:12,119
couldn't consume in public and you know

565
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,918
that you could only be here to consumer

566
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,989
here to consume if you start thinking

567
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,179
about you know being in West Hollywood

568
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,319
and being on the Sunset Strip and be

569
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,090
able to go into places where you can

570
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,250
actually consume cannabis and you're in

571
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:25,619
a social situation what do we know as a

572
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,058
society or a consumption of you know

573
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:28,500
something that's social and for us as

574
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:29,849
beverages and it's always been beverages

575
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,669
and I don't care what culture you're in

576
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:34,709
Japanese Europe South America you know

577
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:36,360
all of it is beverage based when it

578
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,600
comes to like social consumption of of

579
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:41,219
something like so yeah you look at what

580
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,469
you know planet 13's doing right now in

581
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,819
Las Vegas and you think that you know

582
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,079
the next step is they filled out the

583
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:47,189
dispensary the next step is we're going

584
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,960
to build out the sea on this huge

585
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,279
nightclub well if that gets off the

586
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,569
ground I think it will and I think

587
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,519
Nevada has already said we're going to

588
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:54,599
allow for this then you know how are

589
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,829
people getting consumed there because I

590
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:57,959
would argue it's not going to be joints

591
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:59,970
and bonnets you know sock me dad's it's

592
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,409
probably gonna be beverages so if you

593
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,730
look at where you know constellation why

594
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,350
they made this bet in the industry and

595
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,089
people say oh it was a defensive play to

596
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:08,308
make sure that eroding market share away

597
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:10,319
from you know beer now at least they

598
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:11,970
owned where it's going to migrate to or

599
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,808
is it an offensive play of saying you

600
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,610
know what I don't think that we're gonna

601
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:16,288
see that much degradation that's because

602
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:17,969
you know this isn't a new product

603
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:19,619
category this is just a migration of

604
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,509
illicit illegal that this product

605
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:22,979
category is just going to grow I think

606
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:24,539
in many ways it's an offensive play for

607
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,769
the beverage companies to say okay we

608
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:28,139
already have this market share now let's

609
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:29,119
get this market share to if we do let's

610
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,740
do what we know and

611
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,829
just makes a great deal of sense in a

612
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,299
social consumption category does it make

613
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:36,500
sense for people go to a dispensary and

614
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:38,000
say I'm gonna buy a beverage and bring

615
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,009
it home and drink it by comparison to

616
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,529
like everything else it's available I'd

617
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:45,410
argue is no it's never gonna be that

618
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:47,210
popular but but in a social setting I

619
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,290
think it absolutely will be so I think

620
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,890
that's a trend that we should be

621
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:52,970
watching but I don't think it really

622
00:20:51,890 --> 00:21:21,500
interesting until you can actually

623
00:20:52,970 --> 00:21:23,120
consume we do yeah I mean we're gonna

624
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,950
see all the three you know we're gonna

625
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,839
see on top of that we're gonna see the

626
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,360
Unilever's and J&amp;J is the world to know

627
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:31,759
the consumer products goods companies

628
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,500
get in we're gonna see you know in some

629
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,089
ways uh commercial and get involved as

630
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,440
well whether it's your your ATMs of your

631
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:38,449
car gills getting involved but you we're

632
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,130
gonna see every major category get

633
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,450
involved in that I think that all pales

634
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,710
in comparison to what happens when real

635
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,110
private equity gets involved what

636
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,240
happens when you know KKR and TPG and

637
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:50,329
Blackstone get involved like those guys

638
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,700
you know you think a 3.8 billion dollar

639
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:55,279
check of consolation into into a canopy

640
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,590
as big that's nothing nothing compared

641
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,178
to like what happens when when you know

642
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:01,669
Kravis gets involved and writes a check

643
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:04,280
into this industry so you know from the

644
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,410
standpoint of Cronos being tip of the

645
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:07,670
hat to Jason Adler today and Gotham

646
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:10,190
green guys for having the foresight of

647
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:12,050
actually you know really putting a

648
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,160
company on the NASDAQ and figuring out a

649
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:15,829
way to get that across the finish line

650
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,750
when no one else had and and actually

651
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:19,849
getting out there and really working

652
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,109
with with Altria I don't necessarily

653
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:24,139
know if that's what the industry wants

654
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:27,199
so you Big Tobacco involved but it's

655
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,670
inevitable and you know selling that

656
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,610
percentage of your company for 1.8

657
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:33,080
billion dollars in cash I hope I hope a

658
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:34,789
lot of those guys got very wealthy today

659
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:35,689
I hope it's a sign of things to come for

660
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:38,210
a lot of other people you know in this

661
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,930
industry because consolidations coming

662
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,850
and

663
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,970
you know hopefully we can find cash

664
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:53,089
offers instead ilusory stock offers from

665
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:55,519
overcoming all the sort of mid-level of

666
00:22:53,089 --> 00:23:00,079
California companies that are being

667
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:02,599
courted right now you know with 30

668
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:05,089
million-dollar offers 49 50 million

669
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:08,349
dollar operas what advice would you give

670
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:11,359
them I would tell them that when they

671
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:13,039
take a deep breath and they kind of step

672
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,529
away from the offer and speak internally

673
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:18,529
ask yourself whether you want to be

674
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:19,579
acquired by one of those companies are

675
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:22,430
whether you want to be one of those

676
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:25,429
companies and I think that the the play

677
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:26,810
right now is finding other groups that

678
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,310
you really like to work with that you

679
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:30,139
already you know work as different parts

680
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:31,940
and different pieces of supply chain and

681
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,410
say you know maybe I band together with

682
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,580
that guy because we've already work well

683
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,600
together we already know each other well

684
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,429
together and maybe we can then

685
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:38,689
collectively go out and leverage that by

686
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,799
you know putting some more capital

687
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,380
together for us and then making another

688
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:44,059
acquisition until ultimately we go out

689
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,950
on the CSC or hopefully in three or four

690
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:47,299
years we go out on the NASDAQ because

691
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,840
you know if you're going to be acquired

692
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:51,950
by a company corporate culture comes

693
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,059
into play you really have to decide

694
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,590
whether or not the people that you're

695
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,059
selling to are going to be people you

696
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:57,679
want to work with unless you're just you

697
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,329
know saying hey I'm out but for most the

698
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,860
operators are being acquired now they're

699
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:02,119
expected to at least stay for two or

700
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:03,829
three years to help with the transition

701
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:07,819
to integrate their company into whatever

702
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:09,289
the bigger fold is so I would say be

703
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:11,029
very careful what you wish for and think

704
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:12,680
can I actually do it myself and you know

705
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:14,480
can I do it by coddling the other some

706
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:22,620
assets to build the next billion dollar

707
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:25,589
canvas company that's definitely true

708
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:28,408
[Music]

709
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,668
feel like that company's giving you

710
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:32,039
actually because they know they're

711
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:36,059
overvalued and when you can finally sell

712
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:38,730
it 1 year 2 year 3 years later and the

713
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:41,970
stages that may be worth half of what it

714
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:43,769
is today right yeah so my advice that

715
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,360
people are taking these offers is find a

716
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:46,500
way to make sure you're not an insider

717
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,849
if you possibly can

718
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,319
you know if you can say I'll take the

719
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:51,028
same role I have but I'll do it as an

720
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:52,740
outside consulting perspective or you

721
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:53,759
know over the case maybe but trying to

722
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,650
make sure your paper stays off

723
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,730
restriction hard to do most of the

724
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,960
companies won't give you a deal like

725
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:01,200
that but if they really want you they

726
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,579
make but remember that you know whenever

727
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,130
you're taking in there's certain rules

728
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:07,230
that the CSC has around insiders and

729
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,940
what the period of a bleed-out is you

730
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,950
know when you actually have open selling

731
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,870
periods because you're not able to just

732
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,190
walk in day one and say okay I hired for

733
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:15,658
30 million bucks I'm gonna dump thirty

734
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,120
million dollars paper on the market even

735
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:19,409
if you could there's no chance to come

736
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,269
in acquire you would let you because

737
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:22,559
it's gonna you know absolutely tank the

738
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:25,259
share price if there's not a great deal

739
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,220
of volume on that stock so you know do

740
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:27,658
you want to put that much kind of

741
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,190
downward pressure on not just from the

742
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,720
perspective of putting that much paper

743
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,460
in the market but also from the

744
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,778
perspective of the optics that go along

745
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,829
with someone that's an insider that's

746
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:37,798
now looking like they're running for the

747
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:39,000
door so so you have to have a said you

748
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:40,319
know if you're gonna be a choir you have

749
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,630
a great deal of confidence that the

750
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,648
company that's acquiring you is gonna be

751
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,380
able to support their share price is

752
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:48,089
going to be able to to find a secondary

753
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,250
market that's gonna you know continue to

754
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:52,439
take their paper as certain paper comes

755
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,028
off restrictions for the investors so

756
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,580
for instance you know they raise 20

757
00:25:54,028 --> 00:25:58,829
million dollars going into an RTO

758
00:25:55,579 --> 00:26:00,480
that paper comes you know available for

759
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:01,859
everyone start trading on in six months

760
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,690
time or whatever the lock-up period is

761
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:04,918
well those people are gonna start you

762
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,110
know selling it out without having to do

763
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,730
any sort of filings who's buying it you

764
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:09,869
know is there is there a marketplace out

765
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,700
there you know are you working with a

766
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:13,109
large investment bank to say hey when

767
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,038
that stuff comes off restrictions and

768
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:15,599
you know it's gonna start flooding the

769
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:17,308
market are you willing to step in and

770
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,259
start supporting this company by picking

771
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:20,849
those shares up off you know on the open

772
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:22,109
market and that's where it starts

773
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:23,459
getting tricky and you have to have a

774
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:25,229
team that's acquiring you're working

775
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,429
with that's savvy enough to think about

776
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,380
these things it's not just about the

777
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:30,809
initial pop it's about how do we how do

778
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,710
we keep this thing steady as more and

779
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:33,710
more shares coming to the float

780
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:40,590
silts acquired blackbird I believe it

781
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,308
was announced yesterday yep

782
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:44,859
consideration for the Blackbird

783
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:48,220
acquisition consists of us five million

784
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:50,048
cash and us 45 million securities so

785
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,819
your hope for the Blackbird management

786
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:56,378
team is that they structured it they

787
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:58,148
could sell whenever they want right yeah

788
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:59,798
I know Alex Coleman and Bobby lady well

789
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:04,058
max you know there's no chance that they

790
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:05,769
did that you know till those guys are

791
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:06,999
savvy guys you know they're they're

792
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:08,679
trying to build something that as they

793
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:11,200
go into their RTO they've got a you know

794
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,610
pretty strong balance sheet and it stays

795
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,259
strong because their acquisitions are

796
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:16,928
throwing off enough cash to support you

797
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:18,099
know you know till we'll look at if they

798
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,600
say we're gonna acquire this company for

799
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:20,648
50 million they're hoping it puts 200

800
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,048
million in market cap into their

801
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:24,969
business so you know they're not gonna

802
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:27,028
let the the guys around like that would

803
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,409
that be a hope for the for the blackbird

804
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:31,058
founders or owners yeah of course you

805
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:32,320
know ultimately when you sell your

806
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:33,908
company you're hoping for a liquidity

807
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,859
event for you you're not hoping for a

808
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:37,149
downstream event or you'd like to have

809
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:38,408
the option you know if you believe in

810
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:40,178
the company you say from an option

811
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:41,619
allottee perspective am i happy to take

812
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:43,330
some cash take some money off the table

813
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:45,189
and then let the rest ride because I

814
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,778
believe you know that ultimately it's

815
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,788
gonna pay me two three four times as

816
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:51,099
much as it initially did in that case

817
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:53,888
you know if the I would expect that the

818
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:56,319
sellers of black were objectively looked

819
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:58,449
at it and thought can Canales Coleman as

820
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,829
a CEO of tilt take this company to a

821
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,840
place that I couldn't and if I believe

822
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:03,220
in my heart that he can then I'm making

823
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,709
the right decision by making this a

824
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,058
stock deal if you've got overvalued

825
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,558
paper and you've got the opportunity to

826
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:12,038
leverage that overvalued paper to make

827
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,048
acquisitions it's you know it's your

828
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:15,398
financial responsibility as a as a

829
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:17,138
c-suite member of these Canadian

830
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:19,148
companies to try to use as much of your

831
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:22,388
paper as you possibly can but if you're

832
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:23,829
the acquisition target be wary you know

833
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:25,209
you definitely to think to yourself does

834
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:26,558
this management team and that's looking

835
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,788
at acquiring us do we think that they're

836
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:29,558
being able to stabilize their stock

837
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:31,240
price do we think that the the froth on

838
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:33,519
the Canadian market are on the CSE is

839
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,868
gonna continue for the next year or two

840
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,460
to the point where at least we're off

841
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:38,349
restriction we can have our eggs if it's

842
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,669
a full acquisition or you have to ask

843
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,668
yourself you know when I rather be

844
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:44,049
acquired by a group that's gonna pay me

845
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:46,470
substantially less is till consideration

846
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:48,408
but it's a cash deal and

847
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,450
that's where you know it gets tricky we

848
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:52,950
my firm does valuations all the time for

849
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,090
businesses that are trying to either go

850
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,860
through an acquisition or they're trying

851
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:57,869
to go through a Series A or Series B

852
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,129
round and when they come to us and say

853
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,449
well you know how would you put this

854
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,309
number or how do you attach it to this

855
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,870
when this guy over here just got offered

856
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:05,970
four times that much as an acquisition

857
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:07,979
from a canadian-based company and I say

858
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,630
well was it a cash transaction and now

859
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,940
it's 80 percent stock and 20 percent

860
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,190
cash you okay then what happens you know

861
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,870
toll consideration if the stock crashes

862
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,029
by you know seventy five percent and

863
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:19,349
then where's the Delta and that's you

864
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:21,808
know we always try to look at from the

865
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:23,219
standpoint of these Canadian companies

866
00:29:21,808 --> 00:29:24,480
know I think that they're overvalued I

867
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,319
don't think there's any secret about it

868
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,029
but it's there you know it's as smart as

869
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,009
it can possibly be for them to use as

870
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:34,519
little as cash and as much stock as they

871
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:34,519
possibly can
