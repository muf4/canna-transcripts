3
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:29,109
welcome to our pro athletes and cannabis

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,730
panel this is also for anybody that's an

5
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:32,710
athlete whether you're 80 years old and

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,060
you go for a walk in the evening like if

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,640
you're a runner you like to swim

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,980
whatever anybody can use cannabis with

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,179
in athletics so we're quite lucky to

10
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:43,179
have these high end professional

11
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:44,649
athletes up here with us but at the end

12
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:46,479
of the day this this information

13
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,250
translates to everybody in the room so I

14
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,859
always like to analogize that we've got

15
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,539
these top pros but I'll be the average

16
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:55,808
Joe up here and all of you can listen

17
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:57,570
from my perspective as well and I also

18
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,058
really call this panel marijuana

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,590
rebranded it's really I think since the

20
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:06,819
year 2000 when y2k the world didn't end

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,710
everybody kind of started to doubt their

22
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:11,469
certain things and people collectively I

23
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:13,719
think woke up conscious wise in America

24
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:15,370
to the fact we were being lied to about

25
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:19,209
cannabis that's when the culture shift

26
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,620
really to me 2000 happened and now 18

27
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,809
years later it's a beautiful place to

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:25,719
see where we are today

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:29,740
the true rebrand really marijuana was a

30
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:33,459
drug it was bad for you bad people used

31
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:35,709
it it made you lazy made you stupid and

32
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:37,329
even the word itself marijuana just I'm

33
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:39,039
sure most of us know the connotations

34
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:41,950
behind the word we're not positive so

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,900
now cannabis is a medicine and cannabis

36
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,120
is used for wellness and to help people

37
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,870
and to fix seizures and enlightened

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,210
people use cannabis so on that note on

39
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,620
the light of enlightenment I'm going to

40
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:55,119
start off by letting our panelists

41
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,980
starting with Al here introduce

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,900
themselves instead of me doing that and

43
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,460
just I guess the way I'd love for you to

44
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,830
introduce yourself is tell us who you

45
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:04,479
are and then tell us really ultimately

46
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,810
the most important part why you're here

47
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,490
today

48
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,580
well how're you doing my name is al

49
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:12,729

50
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,830

52
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,629
angeles

53
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,009
I live on vacation I love it here but

54
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:22,479
you know what I'm doing here today

55
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:24,909
obviously is just to continue to raise

56
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,699
awareness about the unbelievable

57
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:29,438
benefits of cannabis and you know quick

58
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,389
on my story you know I told you I grew

59
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:33,340
up in Jersey so you know the war on

60
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:36,098
drugs was really real you know where I

61
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,079
grew up I had seen people getting locked

62
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:40,030
up or I was always taught to believe

63
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:44,170
that cannabis or marijuana at the time

64
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,908
or reefer as I was you know happy we

65
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,929
should talk about it where I'm from was

66
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:49,539
a gateway drug

67
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,920
so you know throughout my whole life you

68
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:52,929
know and especially you know me going

69
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:55,988
you know to the NBA out of high school I

70
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,400
was always afraid of cannabis and when I

71
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,810
got in the NBA that was the first time

72
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,700
that I saw actually like you know

73
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,318
top-notch players actually using

74
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:03,908
cannabis but at the time I still didn't

75
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,949
understand it so that makes sense to me

76
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:09,699
and I look down on our teammates that

77
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:11,078
use cannabis but in 2011 my grandmother

78
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:12,908
had come to see me play when I was

79
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:14,109
playing for the Denver Nuggets and you

80
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:16,209
know Denver is obviously one of the

81
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:18,129
first markets to you know have medical

82
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,680
program and she suffered from glaucoma

83
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:22,449
and you know glaucoma was always the

84
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,060
first you know thing that cannabis was

85
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:26,468
you know they actually healed was I you

86
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,568
know was it was something that I said

87
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:30,459
it's a hill so I was able to convince

88
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:32,408
her to try cannabis and it was hard

89
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,420
because you know she was the main person

90
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:38,169
growing up telling us that you know we

91
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:39,968
was a was a gateway drug and um when I

92
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:41,768
was able to get her to try it and I

93
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:43,539
checked on our hour and a half later and

94
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:46,658
uh when I went downstairs she was

95
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:48,098
downstairs reading her Bible and you

96
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:50,528
know when I asked her how she was doing

97
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:51,908
she said I'm healed she that's the first

98
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:54,158
time I've been able to read my Bible in

99
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:55,929
over three and a half years and for me

100
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,968
that correlation was just crazy that you

101
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,560
know from someone like her and I always

102
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:01,498
say like it my grandmother is not going

103
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,729
to heaven we're all going to hell and

104
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:05,560
you know for the first thing that she

105
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:06,278
would do would actually go down and read

106
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,739
her Bible

107
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:10,289
you know she spoke volumes to me and at

108
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,938
that point I started to educate myself

109
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:14,318
the end of that season I actually had a

110
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:17,379
knee surgery and got a staph infection

111
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:19,449
and I was in the hospital for you know

112
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:22,000
ten days I have you know four surgeries

113
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:24,519
in a week and at some point I thought I

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,829
was gonna die but uh when I was sitting

115
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:28,930
in there you know obviously I'm taking

116
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:30,939
all this pain medication and this lady

117
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,540
that I had knew in Colorado came to see

118
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:36,069
me and she introduced me to CBD and she

119
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,020
gave me all these topical she gave me

120
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:39,490
tinctures capsules

121
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:41,139
and you know ever since that day I

122
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,240
haven't taken a hat spring

123
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:46,210
I haven't taken an advil I haven't taken

124
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,699
any pharmaceutical drugs to manage my

125
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:50,228
pain away from the game and uh you know

126
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:58,990
pretty much that's my story and that's

127
00:04:50,228 --> 00:05:02,680
why I'm here though our story is great

128
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:05,439
and gems and everybody's up here and I

129
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,908
think the reason I'm in cannabis is

130
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,529
because ask a lot I ask a lot of

131
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:11,139
questions and do a lot of listening and

132
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:15,549
if you do that you can hear countless

133
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,418
stories of lives this changes my name is

134
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,538
Matt Nordgren

135
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:21,339
I run a fund called Arcadian we do a lot

136
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:23,529
of investing in the industry I've been

137
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:25,839
doing that for years have been very

138
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:28,719
successful at it also was a former

139
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:32,649
athlete some were probably in between

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,770
Joe and out Jim and al I was a backup

141
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:38,079
quarterback my whole career so a little

142
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:41,109
bit of an average Joe that was around a

143
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,668
lot of high level athletes and so you

144
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,520
know didn't have to use a lot of it for

145
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:48,189
pain but was around a lot of guys that

146
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,168
did for the for a long time and and

147
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:53,228
really saw a lot of benefit that it did

148
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:56,589
give a lot of athletes I used it as well

149
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:59,800
in my own personal story my grandmother

150
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:01,948
had Alzheimer's were able to help her

151
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,960
quality of life at the end of her life

152
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:08,590
had a couple of cousins with cancer was

153
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,939
able to increase their life have quality

154
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:13,149
of their life at the end of their life

155
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:15,009
all three have passed and so not just

156
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:18,310
hearing other people's stories but you

157
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:19,778
end up experiencing some of your own and

158
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,870
I think these are the types of things

159
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:26,079
that make this industry work so we got

160
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:29,528
into it it has been one heck of an

161
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:32,168
economic benefit that's for sure but it

162
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:35,079
feels really good being an industry that

163
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:36,490
you can do good business and feel good

164
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,409
about the business that you're doing

165
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:43,879
every day

166
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,879
[Applause]

167
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:49,668
hello oh there we go

168
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:53,629
hi uh hi everyone my name is Eliza

169
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:55,939
Maroney I am the co-founder of Lucky box

170
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:58,819
club a cannabis subscription service

171
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:01,250
here in California yes we actually do

172
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:04,819
deliver actual products to your doorstep

173
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:07,490
and I'm also known as the cannabis yogi

174
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:09,649
so I've launched a brand that infuses

175
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,990
yoga classes with cannabis in various

176
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:14,120
different ways every attendee receives a

177
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,889
lucky box one of our boxes and they get

178
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,199
to learn about new brands and products

179
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:21,228
in the process before during and after

180
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:24,918
their classes it gives people a really

181
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:26,779
warm intimate space to experiment with

182
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:29,750
new products and to learn about the

183
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:33,829
different ways of using cannabis and CBD

184
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,829
as well we have CBD only boxes and I am

185
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:38,120
in this because I just like everyone

186
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,849
else I think in this room have been

187
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,490
profoundly moved by this amazing

188
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:47,390
incredible plant in many different ways

189
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,460
so my history does stem back to being a

190
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,649
cultivator and going from cultivation

191
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:53,269
into retail and really understanding the

192
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:55,370
entire plant process and I'm really

193
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:58,069
proud of that I am not a professional

194
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:01,220
athlete I'm the only one on this stage

195
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:02,959
right now but I do have a lot of insight

196
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,539
in how cannabis can enhance performance

197
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,659
and it can also help people to heal

198
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:22,430
after post-workout and and and games I

199
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:25,430
would imagine so thank you here focused

200
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,019
on this industry um I play for the 49ers

201
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,780
that's who drafted mean the kind of my

202
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:31,519
introduction to the industry firsthand

203
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:34,429
nurse and then then uh Seahawks in the

204
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,838
center the Redskins so we I mean we got

205
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,598
a company started a couple years ago

206
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,919
initially my dad and a couple partners

207
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,778
so now we're transferring which we're

208
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:46,399
translating I'm tripping right now so no

209
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:48,110
we're switching over from agro to of

210
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,209
manufacturing facility so that's where

211
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,250
our primary focus is right now and

212
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,170
the reason I'm really big on marijuana

213
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,820
is just not just me it's my family we as

214
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:57,679
a whole we believe that gonna benefits

215
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,570
of it not just physically but for like

216
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,009
your mental well-being and with my

217
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,960
history on footballs mean I played

218
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,100
linebacker and free safety at Florida

219
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,750
State and then in the league so I've had

220
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,250
plenty injuries dislocated shoulders

221
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:12,110
broken bones concussions disc issues

222
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,600
arthritis so I've had pretty much just

223
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,820
about anything you can imagine so my

224
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,909
thing is like the benefits of the just a

225
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,530
plan itself them wanting to restrict us

226
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:24,409
from being able using prescribed as

227
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,789
opiates that's a big contradiction in my

228
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:27,409
opinion and that's what I'm kind of

229
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:29,480
getting to more so now is the advocacy

230
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:32,329
for that and then the Wellness and the

231
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:36,529
THC and the CBD as well so that's why

232
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm here I'm no Gary Vee but I

233
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:39,949
occasionally swear just as with just a

234
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,289
warning and I wanted to say it must feel

235
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,360
fucking good to be able to come out of

236
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:46,569
the closet of cannabis and not have the

237
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,490
NFL breathing down your neck

238
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:51,500
that was huge because personally for my

239
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,840
experience I was God I was actually in

240
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,370
the drug program so I got put in there

241
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,810
for two years and I put in there well I

242
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,879
failed the test and then I was placed in

243
00:09:56,809 --> 00:10:00,829
there so that comes along with I was

244
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,000
tested twice a week every week so of up

245
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,050
to eight times a month it would come

246
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,019
6:00 in the morning 3:00 in the

247
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:07,519
afternoon Saturday mornings ask you

248
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:10,519
where you are you got to give him a log

249
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,750
of your travel so my actually had family

250
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,699
members and friends that I've actually

251
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,519
been on probation they had less

252
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,930
restrictions and I did but just being in

253
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,819
that process and seeing other guys go

254
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:22,250
through that process and then just that

255
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,200
you actually kind of really realized how

256
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,639
much cannabis does help you in terms of

257
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,840
your injury and then de-stress and like

258
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,879
dealing with the stress of being a pro

259
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,680
athlete the family demands and all that

260
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,539
stuff and then when you have that taken

261
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,979
from you when it's somebody when you're

262
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:35,419
somebody actually relies on that you

263
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,700
don't even realize you rely on it but it

264
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:39,049
does really help you then you kind of

265
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,370
see like the negative outcome or then

266
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:41,539
sometimes you'll be in certain

267
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,769
situations or we wouldn't even have been

268
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:44,329
in that when if you were allowed to

269
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,769
still be able to use cannabis I've seen

270
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,450
different guys get into situations when

271
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,409
they mature program where they start

272
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,060
doing things they wouldn't never

273
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:51,679
normally do and they were just like

274
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:54,829
completely different people in honestly

275
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,599
I think that with the NFL program they

276
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,040
kind of do more detriment than they do

277
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,629
good when they restrict us and then

278
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,949
trying to tell you what to do and this

279
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:02,689
is how you need to act and you got to

280
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,740
follow these rules and you can't act

281
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,300
like everybody else even

282
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,879
you're no person but you gotta act this

283
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:09,649
certain way I mean while some of the

284
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,299
guys that have give writing the checks

285
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:18,319
they do some of the wildest stuff you

286
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:22,309
can imagine no you guys ever watch

287
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:27,020
ballers before I live in mind you said

288
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:28,669
it this was pretty awesome

289
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,620
well no I agree with you two men and

290
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:32,389
really that makes a poignant port point

291
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,070
when you are caught using cannabis

292
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:37,039
you're almost then put over a threshold

293
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:40,460
to have to take opiates for pain because

294
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,899
you can't use a natural remedy there's a

295
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,670
friend of mine named Marvin Washington

296
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:45,679
that played as well and and I think he's

297
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:48,379
in the process of filing some form of

298
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,969
lawsuit you know against the NFL for for

299
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:52,460
forced addiction when they don't give

300
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:55,550
you a solution and yeah it really does

301
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,350
sadly pushes you guys when you can when

302
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,459
you have no other option you know pills

303
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,600
are the only thing to do when you're

304
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,790
playing that hard and being hurt so

305
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:07,159
cheers to you and congrats prone on

306
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:10,219
retirement okay

307
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:12,319
so quickly I'll go over what I do in the

308
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,870
Athletics in cannabis field very quickly

309
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,320
I put on an athletic tour around the

310
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,120
country

311
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,730
somewhat like Tough Mudder or Spartan

312
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,509
Race called the 420 games we compete we

313
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,590
do yoga 4.20 mile runs Jiu Jitsu big al

314
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,500
coach to three-on-three basketball

315
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:29,540
tournament here in Venice last March and

316
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,710
so we go out and we do the opposite of

317
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:33,110
what people think when they hear

318
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,330
cannabis we go bein be active we bring

319
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,950
our families our kids and we don't smoke

320
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,240
at the events and we talk about stuff

321
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,120
like this at the events things like

322
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,430
cannabis is an alternative to opiates I

323
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,620
have an edible line called cannibal can

324
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,750
a fleet and it's an edible product it's

325
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,190
a spray for before you workout for focus

326
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:53,750
and it's a post recovery serum and then

327
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,430
lastly I tried very hard last year to

328
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,769
open the world's first cannabis gym with

329
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:59,870
Ricky Williams it was called power plant

330
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,460
fitness it's a venture on the Shelf that

331
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,129
we hope to eventually bring into

332
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,530
fruition where the trainer's understand

333
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:08,179
how to use cannabis and help you you

334
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:10,549
know figure out if it is or it isn't for

335
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:12,199
you and and that's an important point I

336
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,879
want to touch on I don't think cannabis

337
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,240
on well actually I'm going to back up

338
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:18,889
there are are really two ways athletes

339
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,278
use cannabis you can really delineate it

340
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:24,708
in two very defined manners and one most

341
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:26,208
people understand his recovery CBD you

342
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:28,189
know you hurt you smoke you feel better

343
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:30,049
and we're gonna go into that for sure

344
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,760
today on the opiate side of things but

345
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:33,708
I've always enjoyed it for focus

346
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,838
I've always liked to smoke before I go

347
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:38,208
into the gym before I swim before I ski

348
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,100
before I surf and it gives me something

349
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,019
you know that's a focus that I don't

350
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,149
normally have it really translates

351
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:45,799
across my life with a DD like when I was

352
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,720
in college I smoked to write my term

353
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:50,240
papers and I just needed it almost for a

354
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,850
focus you know ie a medicine versus to

355
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,950
get high so there's really two ways

356
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,230
focus athletes can use it for training

357
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:00,080
or during athletics or they can use it

358
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,839
for recovery so I wanted to kind of

359
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,149
actually like Matt for example

360
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,070
did you ever use cannabis during your

361
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:12,019
career when you were training or during

362
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:14,810
a game yeah Jim both the categories you

363
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:18,139
just mentioned used it for and so did a

364
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:20,838
lot of the guys I don't know I mean in

365
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:23,720
our sport I would imagine the numbers

366
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:27,680
have got to be 60% of the players

367
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:33,850
probably York higher maybe NBA it's

368
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:36,708
probably what like 95.9 yeah I mean it's

369
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,899
you know either way it's a significant

370
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:42,708
amount of people that benefit from using

371
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:46,278
this for both of those areas I did and

372
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:48,019
and I saw a lot of guys do it Jim anyone

373
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:50,419
else want to chime in on focus the at

374
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:53,958
the aspect of using cannabis to get the

375
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:55,429
what I call I of the tiger me in

376
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,049
particular I like to use it to focus for

377
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:58,609
me it's like it takes away the

378
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:00,409
nervousness and the butterflies so it

379
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,490
just kind of makes me feel like you do

380
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:03,289
go out there every day in practice

381
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,539
there's another day nothing out of the

382
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:08,419
ordinary just makes everything normal

383
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:09,769
easy what I like to liken it to is to

384
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:11,360
everything in life there's something

385
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:12,799
called flow state and whether you're an

386
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,230
athlete whether you're a musician

387
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,539
whether you're an artist having sex

388
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,430
anything when you're just your mind goes

389
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:21,110
away and your body just becomes one with

390
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:23,569
your mind that's called flow State

391
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,089
that's why artists have always been kind

392
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,910
of let you know let to be that sect that

393
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:30,050
used cannabis and psychedelics and even

394
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:32,238
the surf community

395
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:34,008
and whatnot so flow state is something

396
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:35,778
again I like to translate this beyond

397
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:38,058
just athletics and why cannabis really

398
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:39,919
it's a good for athletes and fitness but

399
00:15:38,058 --> 00:15:42,169
it correlates across our whole life to

400
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,118
allow us to enjoy things like athletics

401
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:45,438
it makes the things you love it allows

402
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:49,428
you to love them a little bit more and

403
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:51,860
appreciate them a little bit more so so

404
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:53,448
on the focus side of things

405
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,220
I think we kind of covered it I think

406
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:57,229
you know al you've mentioned before you

407
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,209
don't like to use cannabis before you

408
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,860
train and again I want to hear from Al

409
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,868
because I don't think everybody should

410
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,028
use cannabis and it's important to hear

411
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:06,470
from someone who maybe it doesn't affect

412
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:10,039
in the best way before they get in the

413
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:12,739
gym yeah for me so I'm an indica smoker

414
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:14,868
so I like to smoke the heavy stuff so

415
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:16,429
I'd go sit down and chill out so that's

416
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:18,589
the reason why for me like you know

417
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:20,419
obviously for me to consume right before

418
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:22,100
trying to do anything especially

419
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:24,198
athletics is probably not the right

420
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,019
thing now most people say well chew

421
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:29,808
straw sativas so I've tried the tea bus

422
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,938
and then sativas make my heart race so I

423
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:34,159
was in a lose-lose so that's why I

424
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:37,368
actually choose not to you know consume

425
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:40,009
before but um you know I don't knock it

426
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:42,048
I've actually started to be able to kind

427
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:44,629
of control it now you know because I use

428
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:47,928
so much you know I've been using this a

429
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:50,119
lot so like now I actually can smoke

430
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:52,338
indicas and actually get stuff done I

431
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:56,149
have four kids so I have to medicate

432
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,679
before I deal with them so uh so I've

433
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:01,938
changed I've changed a little bit jump

434
00:16:57,678 --> 00:17:03,860
but you like that another point on that

435
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,298
Jimmy and the interesting thing is just

436
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,449
being able to figure out what works for

437
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:10,759
you because it's the amount of products

438
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:12,620
that are coming to the market now you

439
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:15,439
can sort of experiment and do just what

440
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:18,678
Al did and no one person is alike I mean

441
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,630
our chemical makeup is so different our

442
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,309
systems work so different that it's just

443
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,010
important to continue to figure out what

444
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:26,209
works for you and what environment yeah

445
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:29,509
you know that's something I wanted to

446
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:31,308
touch on and and I think al if indicas

447
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:33,379
you know are more sleepy and heavy to

448
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:34,788
you that's a great way that you know

449
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,590
yourself you know what you want in your

450
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:39,619
medicine and you know when to use it and

451
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:42,349
to me the one thing I'd like to try and

452
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:43,819
debunk to as much as I can we've got dr.

453
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:46,309
sue Sisley here in the front

454
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:49,369
today hey dr. sue let's give sue a hand

455
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:50,779
I might even ask you a question right

456
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:53,239
now

457
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:55,579
but you know there's a long myth in my

458
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,230
opinion that indica means one thing in

459
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:58,819
sativa means the other meaning that

460
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,069
indicas had heavy and it makes you

461
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:04,789
sleepy and a sativa is an energizing

462
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:06,439
cannabis you know result and what Matt

463
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:08,659
just said is truthfully to me what's

464
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,400
most important everybody especially I'm

465
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,009
saying this because we're talking about

466
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,259
fitness and cannabis knowing what works

467
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:18,289
for you is way more important than hey

468
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:20,299
bro do you have an indica or sativa so

469
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:22,549
it's like understanding your body type

470
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:25,970
and then how cannabis works but you know

471
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:27,980
from a science standpoint the the myth

472
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:30,410
has really been shown that indica does

473
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,390
not necessarily mean one thing and

474
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,130
sativa doesn't and the easiest way to

475
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,900
understand that is two people can smoke

476
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,150
the same plant and they feel completely

477
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,400
opposite so it's really about knowing

478
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,080
yourself especially within athletics in

479
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:48,019
terms of what type of cannabis you use

480
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:50,240
and when I'm in on this one because it's

481
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:51,710
something I love talking about but it's

482
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,140
really interesting to see that it's

483
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,009
really not indica sativa anymore and now

484
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,840
that we're learning so much about

485
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:59,089
terpenes and different cannabinoids and

486
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:01,490
even how our endocannabinoid receptor

487
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:05,029
system works I mean there's so much

488
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,950
research that has not happened yet right

489
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:08,779
because it has been federally illegal so

490
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:12,170
this is something that we're just now

491
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:13,819
touching the surface and it's really

492
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,340
important to understand that there are

493
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,950
different ways to also apply cannabis to

494
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:22,039
your workout I mean it sounds like you

495
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,620
should be using topicals like topicals

496
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:27,409
are amazing and people don't give it

497
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:28,789
enough credit there are so many ways for

498
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:31,250
your body to benefit from cannabis as

499
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:33,349
well as tinctures understanding CBD

500
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,630
versus CBN and how you can use blends

501
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:37,159
and creating your own blend there it

502
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,650
really goes deep and I don't want to go

503
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,090
off on a tangent but just pointing out

504
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:44,150
that there's so much more than just

505
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:45,919
smoking or vaping nowadays and and its

506
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,690
really a blessing that we have all of

507
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,519
these options even patches I've been

508
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,259
saying lately you know well yeah and

509
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,109
what I take from you dialing it dialing

510
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:55,970
it right into this is that you really

511
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,809
have a lot of options to choose exactly

512
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,700
what

513
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:03,230
type of medicine to get you where you

514
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:05,630
want to be and so again I just think

515
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,519
it's starting slow is important and let

516
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,110
in this room I just a show of hands I'm

517
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,670
interested who likes to use cannabis

518
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:13,669
before they go for a run or they do

519
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:18,700
something athletic so it's about half

520
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:22,340
and half very interesting all right well

521
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,259
so cannabis has also been proven to be a

522
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:25,789
neuro protectant and that's something I

523
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:28,849
kind of want to touch on and delve into

524
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:31,220
the CBD side of things you know we've

525
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:33,169
got big x pro athletes that played

526
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,940
football here and then we've got a yogi

527
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,529
and we've got al who played basketball

528
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,680
where you get banged around pretty darn

529
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:43,519
good and so we all use CBD in different

530
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,019
ways in a recovery facet but Matt do you

531
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,910
want to talk a little bit about CBD as a

532
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:49,579
neuro protectant and how like a football

533
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:51,500
player uses CBD both you know prior to

534
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:53,899
injury as well as post traumatic injury

535
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,390
yeah that would be I'd love to talk

536
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,920
about that in particular as my father

537
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:03,410
was a pro football player and as was I

538
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,870
you know i grew up around all of these

539
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:10,040
players from the 60s and 70s so i get to

540
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:12,229
see it at 50 60 70 years old the

541
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:14,389
repercussions and these guys are in

542
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,819
tremendous amounts of pain almost none

543
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,880
of them aren't in some kind of pain and

544
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:21,500
head trauma is a lot of it maybe we

545
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,680
ought to give dr. sue more money so she

546
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,309
can figure some of these things out but

547
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:32,360
you know we to see my generation now see

548
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:34,940
the past generations downfall and you've

549
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,409
seen the movies I mean it's it's a

550
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,259
really important topic for us all think

551
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:43,100
about CBD is a great way to do it a non

552
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:46,549
psychoactive molecule you can derive it

553
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:48,439
from hemp or cannabis and with Mitch

554
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:52,819
McConnell's efforts we're about to have

555
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,130
him legal federally thank God we think

556
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:57,319
very soon so it's going to be tough for

557
00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:01,670
the NFL to not recognize that in other

558
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:03,589
sports but I think that there's a lot of

559
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,910
different types of CVD as she talked

560
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,529
about you kind of have to figure out

561
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:10,190
which one's good for you there's some

562
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:10,730
great brands we can suggest I think as a

563
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,000
neuro

564
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:16,759
protector you know we would I'd see guys

565
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,579
using it literally ten minutes before

566
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:21,500
game time and it's because CVD doesn't

567
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:24,500
take away from their ability to use

568
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,410
their minds as much as THC might so I've

569
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:30,470
seen that but I've also seen Jim a lot

570
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,509
of guys using it on mondays get day

571
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,970
after games to do more of the

572
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:37,039
rehabilitation efforts and and I think

573
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,839
rather than being pumped full of all

574
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,730
these medicines that they would prefer

575
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:42,859
to give you which I know you can talk

576
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,120
about and dr. sue and Mike James who's

577
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:46,548
got some great stories out there can

578
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:48,769
tell you about and I've get playing

579
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:50,629
football I get tammany these minor

580
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:52,190
concussions you get I mean every time

581
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,390
you get hit you just assume like you

582
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,429
shake it off but there are little

583
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,679
concussions and we've all had the real

584
00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:01,009
ones I mean they knock it lights out so

585
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,830
a real thing and so if CVD can be

586
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:05,150
helpful in these efforts it's it's

587
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:06,500
something we all need to consider I

588
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,880
think CVD is really important when it

589
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,230
comes to the neuro stuff because I'm

590
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,700
Mike is a good friend of mine we

591
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,829
actually trained do rehab down the same

592
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,360
place in Miami so I've seen firsthand

593
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:15,740
like him recovering from the concussions

594
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,928
in having to wear the glasses not had a

595
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,519
couple concussions myself and I've had

596
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,470
any questions I know weren't documented

597
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,690
but I've know I've had like I definitely

598
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,710
had over ten so sometimes every now and

599
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,330
then I'll get like little headaches in

600
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,069
the front in front of my head when I

601
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:29,509
notice when I take my cell lingual CBD

602
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:32,119
and things like that that the pressure

603
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:33,140
go away or like anything anxiety and

604
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,359
stuff like they had things that from the

605
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,860
just remark it's Rama in contact it

606
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,659
helps it helps with the relief of that

607
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:40,490
laughs and I hear there from a lot of

608
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,540
guys now so that's more and more people

609
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,339
they're kind of reaching out trying to

610
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:44,599
find out more and more about CBD and see

611
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:47,298
how they can get their hands on it now

612
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,428
to treat their symptoms al you know you

613
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:51,079
have you're quite the entrepreneur and

614
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:53,150
I've admired your your rise in the

615
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:55,849
industry with your brands and viola and

616
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,530
and everything else so when we talk

617
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:59,659
about CBD something I think as an

618
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:01,210
athlete and again translating across the

619
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,320
board but especially for recovery

620
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:06,230
there's something called whole plant

621
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:08,119
medicine and you can take CBD CBD has

622
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,829
become a buzzword in the general public

623
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,928
and half the time like quite honestly

624
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:13,668
it's like when you buy organic food I

625
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:15,798
wonder like is this really organic or do

626
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:17,390
they just put that on the box so it's

627
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:19,369
really important like with all of your

628
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,320
food and life food is medicine it's how

629
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,789
I'm going to end this today know where

630
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:24,579
your medicine comes from just because

631
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:25,778
something says CBD doesn't mean

632
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:27,369
good for you and it doesn't even mean

633
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:29,950
they're CBD in it so know where you're

634
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:31,839
getting your medicine and people like Al

635
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,970
who are doing it the right way tested

636
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:35,408
whole plant medicine is an option where

637
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,380
people you know you don't have to take

638
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:40,630
THC but when you ratio it was THC and

639
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,299
whether it's an eighteen to one to CBD

640
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:46,179
and it's a very low amount of THC using

641
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:47,829
the whole plant versus an extract can be

642
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:49,600
much times it's called the entourage

643
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:51,639
effect and it's a lot more beneficial

644
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,949
sometimes medicinally to have that

645
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,710
combination of the whole plant do you

646
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:59,288
want to talk a little bit about you know

647
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:01,210
excuse me whole plant medicine yeah so

648
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:03,429
um you know so like you said you know

649
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,710
for me obviously you know we first

650
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:10,630
started I had to go through the

651
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:12,220
education process and you know my I had

652
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:16,659
needs so I first need surgery I had I

653
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:20,079
think was in 2001 and from 2001 to 2009

654
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:24,250
I used to take anti-inflammatories like

655
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,658
celebrex Advil every day like I was

656
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,730
taking one in the morning one at night

657
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:29,320
the weather was during the season or you

658
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,940
know or in the summertime when I was

659
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,038
actually training to get ready for the

660
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,840
season and we all know like you know the

661
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,250
potential side effects you know and I

662
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,500
and I looked at him I knew what they

663
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:40,329
were but you know like a lot of us on

664
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,069
this panel you know especially athletes

665
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:44,138
you know this is a way to make a living

666
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:46,538
so you kind of got to put your body in

667
00:25:44,138 --> 00:25:47,769
those positions or those predicaments

668
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:49,359
and kind of just have to see what

669
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:51,609
happens because you're providing for

670
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,048
your family and stuff like that but once

671
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:55,569
like I introduced the cannabis and I

672
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:58,929
realized I had an all-natural you know

673
00:25:55,569 --> 00:26:01,240
option you know it's spun me for a loop

674
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:03,548
because I was just like how can how can

675
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,839
these professional teams say they have

676
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:06,908
our best interests at heart

677
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:09,490
but they don't want to give us something

678
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:11,200
that you know that we could take that is

679
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,179
without all the you know potential side

680
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,500
effects of you know I always laugh about

681
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:16,179
when we look at these commercials of

682
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,190
these new drugs that come online and

683
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,769
it's just like you know people skipping

684
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,690
you know to a sunset and everything is

685
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:25,839
just so happy and then at the end is

686
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:28,440
like side effects instant death internal

687
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:30,359
bleeding eyeballs falling out

688
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,670
and you think about what cannabis we

689
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,289
have none of that you know and you know

690
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,690
for me like I said you know started with

691
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:38,639
my grandmother then me and now I was

692
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:41,460
like my whole family like literally my

693
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,810
whole family consumes my I just went

694
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,460
through about a breast cancer went

695
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,990
through chemo you know I gave up Rick

696
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,759
Simpson oil that you know one of my

697
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,440
friends produced for her she actually

698
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,099
gained weight you know throughout the

699
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,350
process

700
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:54,179
my grandmother's Church you know

701
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:56,189
obviously you know she's 80 some years

702
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,960
old and all her friends are 80 something

703
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,940
years old so they get knee replacements

704
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,620
and hip replacements and she's always

705
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,390
calling me out what can what can they

706
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:05,729
take so now my grandma was actually the

707
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:09,780
biggest drug deal in our church that's

708
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:13,769
what she's transitioned to but she's

709
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:15,869
also the most popular exactly but yeah

710
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:17,579
but you know ever since I've learned

711
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:20,549
this you know my daughter you know

712
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:22,589
literally I just last week so I put my

713
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:26,250
daughter on a CBD regiment you know she

714
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:28,230
has ADHD and you know watching her

715
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:30,420
personality swings and different things

716
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,370
like that and being a you know we're

717
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,500
giving her drug that I fully don't even

718
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:36,659
understand and you know when I really

719
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,670
think about it the this the course that

720
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,550
was setting her on is that she will be

721
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,740
taking pills for the rest of her life

722
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:45,509
so I got to stop that and I'm gonna try

723
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,009
to stop it through this plan and we're

724
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:48,180
gonna see what cannabis does we're gonna

725
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:49,619
start like she said we're gonna start

726
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,570
messing with blends and different things

727
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:56,339
like that and we're gonna try to heal

728
00:27:51,569 --> 00:28:01,379
her or naturally it'll work

729
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:03,119
get away I have ADHD so when I was in

730
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,710
college I was diagnosed my head coach

731
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,509
actually suggested I would tested for it

732
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,829
and that was one of my ways and medical

733
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:09,569
one of my reasons for Medicaid was my a

734
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:11,849
DD it would help you focus and study my

735
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:13,109
plays because if I didn't if I didn't

736
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:14,250
smoke there was no way I could like sit

737
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,959
still and they actually sit there and

738
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,180
study I'll go play the game go out and

739
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,640
then that was big that was big for my

740
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:23,250
EDD and I was a medication in the league

741
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,780
I was on ritalin so I was dehydrated my

742
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,339
heart rate would go about during

743
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:28,049
practice I'd be sweating so much like I

744
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,329
would my hands would be clamming I'd

745
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:31,710
have to drink Pedialyte they had all the

746
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:34,529
head on centers and I had to take their

747
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,090
I'll take 30 milligrams twice a day in

748
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:39,230
that how it works though right if you

749
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:42,179
take your kid into the doctor and

750
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:44,099
bouncing around too much Oh a DD you

751
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,930
need to get a matter all you take your

752
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,339
kidneys not bouncing around oh my gosh

753
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:54,810
she's depressed we're gonna need to put

754
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:56,939
them on some antidepressants yeah it is

755
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:59,789
it's sad I I really hate that I'm trying

756
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:02,100
to naturally teach my family an Eastern

757
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:05,279
philosophy of medicine versus a Western

758
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:07,969
and they all drugs aren't bad this is

759
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,960
I've talked so much bad stuff about the

760
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,420
pharmaceutical industry I want to say

761
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,610
one thing we're lucky to live in a place

762
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,470
where technology surgery and and even

763
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:18,629
medicine pharmaceutically can keep us

764
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,500
alive longer and help us but it's so

765
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:23,610
goddamn overused that's the problem that

766
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,109
cannabis can accept there's a place for

767
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:27,209
opiates you know when you're hurt and

768
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:29,429
you're really really really hurt there's

769
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:33,000
a place for it but really you can use

770
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:35,060
cannabis to really accentuate and as a

771
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,140
complement to those type of

772
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:39,359
pharmaceuticals when you have to take

773
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,100
them thereby reducing the amount of

774
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:45,990
pharmaceuticals that you have to take as

775
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:47,399
well so interesting I that's a cool

776
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,049
story about your daughter I'm looking

777
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,850
into my daughter's just like me with

778
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:53,579
ADHD and we're trying to figure out ways

779
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:55,319
to to get her to calm down as well let

780
00:29:53,579 --> 00:30:01,500
you know what I figure out yeah please

781
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:03,629
do so you know this isn't a new thing I

782
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,730
like to always point out like we when I

783
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,010
started the 420 games a few years ago it

784
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,159
was like this big Wow we've never seen

785
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:11,919
anything like this

786
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:14,169
fleets and marijuana oh my gosh but it

787
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,489
it wasn't it's like a secret fraternity

788
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:16,960
that we all were in for all these

789
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:19,538
decades you know especially these guys

790
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,069
like they all knew that they inside the

791
00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:22,868
locker room that they used weed but they

792
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,668
couldn't talk about it and I couldn't

793
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:26,168
talk about it cuz I was an executive and

794
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:27,849
you know people could get blacked out at

795
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:33,090
our Christmas parties but God forbid I

796
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:36,009
lit a joint I would be an outcast so

797
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:37,269
it's a it's and so I looked back as I

798
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:39,339
started to do this because I was a

799
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:41,019
closeted cannabis user since I played

800
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,339
soccer in high school and I was the

801
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:44,950
starting pitcher and my baseball team

802
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:46,988
and and all that and I looked and you

803
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,179
know pumping iron Lou Ferrigno and

804
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:50,649
Arnold Schwarzenegger in the early 70s

805
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:52,450
they were smoking weed at the gym when

806
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:54,998
they were competing for mr. universe the

807
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,889
most prestigious bodybuilding contest in

808
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:59,259
the world you know we've got Phelps

809
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:01,298
Hussein the fastest in land and water

810
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:04,329
ever those were both known cannabis

811
00:31:01,298 --> 00:31:06,009
users I'm a man right here Big Al and

812
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,808
the entire NBA

813
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:09,878
that's why fifty dollahs you know the

814
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:11,678
NBA represents the most heavy cannabis

815
00:31:09,878 --> 00:31:13,209
using professional sports league and

816
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,710
they're the most incredible athletes

817
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:17,769
that I like to watch more than any of

818
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:24,009
them so it's just seasons was it for you

819
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:29,739
17 that's a lot of seasons later god I

820
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:36,128
wasn't getting concussions thank God no

821
00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:37,840
303 still well on that note I want to

822
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:39,339
ask you know starting with Alan then we

823
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,148
can go down the line or whoever wants to

824
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:44,678
pop in but to me like a question as a

825
00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:47,618
proponent for the pro athletes is how do

826
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:49,210
we get the professional athletes the

827
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:51,759
owners of these businesses and these

828
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:53,558
teams to allow cannabis to be used and I

829
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,409
think we all kind of have seen CBD as

830
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:58,028
our gateway my my statement and my

831
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:59,440
unfortunate reality is that it's only

832
00:31:58,028 --> 00:32:01,749
going to be money and we need to with

833
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,548
data prove that cannabis can actually be

834
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:05,169
better medicine with people like Sue and

835
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:06,460
her research to show that this will

836
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:08,259
actually get you on the field and keep

837
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,729
you playing longer and they're not going

838
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:12,819
to really do it just because it makes

839
00:32:09,729 --> 00:32:14,169
somebody feel better so what do you guys

840
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:16,598
think you know how are we going to get

841
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:17,570
this legalized to use cannabis in the

842
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:19,189
NFL and beyond

843
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:21,200
well I think the first thing you said is

844
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,119
true it's gonna take money testing sue

845
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,340
you know what I'm saying to continue to

846
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:28,069
you know break down these barriers but

847
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:30,918
what I think you know like just say MBA

848
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:34,069
guys right it's gonna take one of the

849
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:35,960
top guys to come out and say he used you

850
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:38,839
know if I'm NFL I always say like if Tom

851
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,220
Brady did it but from the NBA you know I

852
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:42,648
personally think it's gonna happen

853
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,929
sooner than later too because the league

854
00:32:42,648 --> 00:32:48,469
has changed a lot in the way I say let's

855
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:49,879
call the run labret but I got somebody

856
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,210
close to LeBron that's thinking about

857
00:32:49,878 --> 00:32:54,949
doing it but um you know these guys are

858
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,659
in a different stage in their life so

859
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,798
like when I was coming up just to say

860
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:59,539
like you know there wasn't as much

861
00:32:57,798 --> 00:33:01,128
endorsement money and different things

862
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:03,108
like that but if there was you know he

863
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:05,509
was tied to McDonald's and four million

864
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:07,519
dollars and I was a lot of money but now

865
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:10,098
these guys are making 40 million dollars

866
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,749
just from me a contract and then they

867
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:13,489
have all these endorsement deals and

868
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:16,069
stuff like that so I personally think

869
00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:18,229
that now they make so much money that

870
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:20,210
they don't care no more they like I'm

871
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:23,119
gonna be exactly who I am now I don't

872
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,399
have to hide Who I am and I personally

873
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:27,528
think that you know there will be an NBA

874
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:29,719
player that will make this statement

875
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:31,608
within I would say like the next two

876
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,259
years and then I think that'll just

877
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:35,598
continue to push the conversation

878
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:37,098
forward and we're sorry got to continue

879
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:39,769
to break down barriers and then we need

880
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:41,808
people like us who are retired at least

881
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:43,368
to speak our truths and like you said

882
00:33:41,808 --> 00:33:45,440
come out the weed closet or the green

883
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:46,759
closet and as we continue to do that we

884
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,269
just keep raising awareness and we'll

885
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:52,788
just keep breaking down barriers that is

886
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:54,348
great to hear well I think you're right

887
00:33:52,788 --> 00:33:56,329
I mean what a great world we live in now

888
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:57,499
that everybody has a voice right I mean

889
00:33:56,329 --> 00:34:00,019
you're seeing this across the board

890
00:33:57,499 --> 00:34:02,389
people can be exactly who they are and

891
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:05,899
not be so worried about it anymore which

892
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:07,328
is really the ultimate I don't even know

893
00:34:05,898 --> 00:34:09,648
how to say it but the ultimate

894
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:12,469
responsibility that the cannabis

895
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:14,210
industry has is to build an industry the

896
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:16,539
right way from the beginning female

897
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,679
empowerment sustainability

898
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:20,148
environmentally conscious I mean we get

899
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,159
to do all this versus every other

900
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:24,108
industry that's trying to reverse

901
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,210
engineer themselves right now so by

902
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:28,039
speaking up doing things right as we

903
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,320
build this it's not only our

904
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:33,529
responsibility but it's

905
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,760
it's sort of a luxury and it's great to

906
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,679
hear that you think there's some big

907
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,929
people about to say some things and I

908
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:41,690
think across the board some big actors

909
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:43,340
are about to do that some NFL guys I

910
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:46,250
mean I think we're gonna continue to see

911
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:54,019
the chips fall as long as we could good

912
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:55,668
research back from dr. sue well my

913
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:59,630
perspective is is very much in line with

914
00:34:55,668 --> 00:35:02,210
yours I would say that initially we need

915
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,590
education we need to educate people the

916
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,240
same way that you had to educate your

917
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:07,670
grandmother and show her that this isn't

918
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:10,309
something to be afraid of it's our job

919
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:13,280
as the cannabis community to come

920
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:15,619
together and really take the time to go

921
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,540
to your families and to explain to your

922
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:19,190
kids what this is explain to your

923
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:20,659
parents what this is explain to your

924
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,119
grandparents what this is and how it

925
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:25,279
affects your life and then when the time

926
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,739
comes and when the athletes are ready

927
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,940
it's your guys's job to endorse the

928
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:30,619
right brands that are doing the right

929
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,019
thing in this industry because there are

930
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:34,549
so many bad actors but there are lots of

931
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:36,409
us with the right heart that really want

932
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:41,930
to get clean products into your family's

933
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:43,489
hands I think with the NFL to take a

934
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:45,079
little longer though because with them

935
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:46,639
it's more so like to image the league

936
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,900
and the brand just how you kind of see

937
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,819
it is with the stands from national

938
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,410
anthem as far as like on a lower level

939
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,820
like the coaches themselves there's are

940
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:54,079
this coaches I've had personally they're

941
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,220
just like if you guys are gonna do it go

942
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,779
ahead like we know if you need it you

943
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,789
need it like we're aware of they're like

944
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,500
we got our tests our annual tests once a

945
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:02,599
year so it's either in a spring or some

946
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,849
training camp and if you feel that

947
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:06,259
that's when you're in a program so if

948
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:07,759
once you pass that test you're good for

949
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,110
the year so they're pretty much they

950
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,970
know whether they're fully aware is just

951
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,260
they don't want to be so blatant that

952
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:14,809
for it to damage the brand it's all

953
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,160
about the brand so once it gets like to

954
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:17,449
like a cobra level a house in Canada

955
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,399
like with canopy with that level where

956
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:21,019
the same guys that like Jerry Jones had

957
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,180
soil and money in the oil he can put

958
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:24,349
into marijuana then they'll be all for

959
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:26,179
it cuz remember the end of the day those

960
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,739
guys the owners they're businessmen so

961
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:29,899
the business is side of it it's really

962
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:32,329
opening their eyes because a good friend

963
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,099
of mine is actually a big corporate

964
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:36,079
owner and he's friends with a couple

965
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:37,309
owners the NFL and they're kind of

966
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,509
opening their eyes to their business

967
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:39,739
opportunities over the actually put some

968
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,700
money into the stocks in Canada and

969
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,639
things like that so the kind of they're

970
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,828
coming around but

971
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:45,808
I think then if the MBA is is always

972
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:46,980
ahead of the NFL in terms of player in

973
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:48,150
terms of how they treat the players and

974
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,818
what they had a little player to express

975
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:54,269
themselves and they actually say and did

976
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:59,130
the players have baseball hockey don't

977
00:36:54,268 --> 00:37:01,949
even care do they they'll just follow it

978
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,900
follow you guys lead so I want to know

979
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:06,179
if you're tested once a year and you

980
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,670
know you get the call you know you're

981
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:10,498
clean you go get tested how high do you

982
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:14,608
get right after that when you leave the

983
00:37:10,498 --> 00:37:17,219
testing facility it depends on how long

984
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:23,460
you had to wait so if you had like in

985
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:26,358
the spring to say it's April June so you

986
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,619
stopped in like March so you have like

987
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:30,449
I'll usually give myself I would cut it

988
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:32,430
short because I like had my system down

989
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:34,259
I'd like all right my buddy fast here up

990
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:35,788
like I need this mayonnaise I get I got

991
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:37,248
drink two gallons of water a day do my

992
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:39,420
regular workouts I'll be good in 10 days

993
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:40,679
so like I would cut it closer to most

994
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,619
guys but a lot of people would do like

995
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:44,818
30 they were stopped in but I remember

996
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:46,289
like after that everybody had their

997
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:47,579
chest and everybody with that goat the

998
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:48,749
everybody would go link up together and

999
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:50,970
everybody just have a good big session

1000
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:52,409
yeah all the tests came maybe like a

1001
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,879
whole thing they do about second a lot

1002
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:55,920
of time so like a little bit of DBS

1003
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,180
sometimes we'd be like oh they do

1004
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,409
something everybody think is corny

1005
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:00,690
because most of the most times the guys

1006
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:02,578
I don't smoke is hola me but most part

1007
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,720
so good like in the spring the first

1008
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,680
test like everybody would get mad

1009
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,730
they're all wide chest no alignment

1010
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:10,108
first they you know they don't smoke

1011
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:11,548
anyway so I was like yes they do about

1012
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:13,139
say group and things like that it kind

1013
00:38:11,548 --> 00:38:15,059
of brings everybody gets split everybody

1014
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:18,268
gets done it's bringing in a training

1015
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:21,079
camp kickers own kickers yeah so yeah

1016
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:23,639
you get those get them out the wing

1017
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:25,589
thank you ceremony for that I would have

1018
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:29,460
a have a bowl loaded and just be ready

1019
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:31,980
to rock after that test now interesting

1020
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,630
stuff and so you know I think it is

1021
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,369
something important to say again like

1022
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,829
you know all these guys have lived these

1023
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:40,289
lifes and and it had to wait until now

1024
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:42,269
so I work I want to quickly mention an

1025
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:43,980
organization Sue's on the board I was

1026
00:38:42,268 --> 00:38:45,479
part of it Matt's part of it you're

1027
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,170
gonna be part of it soon I hope if

1028
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,778
you'll honor us

1029
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:51,269
it's called athletes for care we work

1030
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:53,000
with retired athletes not only just to

1031
00:38:51,268 --> 00:38:54,859
help them understand cannabis but

1032
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,900
to help understand how to assimilate

1033
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,849
back into life after you know beyond

1034
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,050
beyond the glory kind of thing so when

1035
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:01,610
the lights go off and you're not a

1036
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:03,610
professional athlete anymore it's not

1037
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,809
the most easy thing in the world

1038
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,150
financially in a lot of other ways and

1039
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:09,710
so beyond just teaching them cannabis is

1040
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,660
an alternative to-- Piet's we've got

1041
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:13,369
mentors and then people who are just out

1042
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:14,989
of the league and you know one of the

1043
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:16,759
big things and pillars of that

1044
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:18,709
organization and again it's not just

1045
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,750
cannabis but I want to mention that one

1046
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:23,030
of the pillars is cannabis to keep them

1047
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:27,429
level and keep them healthy and it's a

1048
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:32,180
great organization you should check out

1049
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:35,119
so as we end here kind of as we wrap

1050
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:38,989
this into kind of Q&amp;A to me what I've

1051
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,299
seen happen is a movement of a few guys

1052
00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:43,219
doing this and then starting to talk and

1053
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,400
then a few more X guys talk in and then

1054
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:48,409
gain 420 games and other people starting

1055
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,210
things there's there's a social movement

1056
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:51,589
out there and it's there's thousands and

1057
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:54,079
thousands of people that define

1058
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,850
themselves as athletes that use cannabis

1059
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,380
can of athletes or whatever you want to

1060
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:59,000
call it in there that's what your

1061
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,119
product line is built for from what I

1062
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,130
can see how and so it's just it's I'm

1063
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,049
very very thankful to these guys so I

1064
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,730
want before we wrap this up and go into

1065
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,680
a Q&amp;A let's give them a huge round of

1066
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:11,360
applause for being branded they're the

1067
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:15,279
frontlines of this movement it's these

1068
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,390
guys that are gonna help us legalize it

1069
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,440
really is these guys that are gonna help

1070
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:23,420
move it across the line so you know from

1071
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,079
here I guess why don't we jump into a

1072
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,400
little bit of a Q&amp;A you got a mic all

1073
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,250
right

1074
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,630
this questions for Jim you mentioned the

1075
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:37,550
power plant fitness center what's the

1076
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:40,130
state the current state of on-site

1077
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,510
consumption in the regulations now and

1078
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,450
what do you think that would be possible

1079
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:48,200
that you will be able to open a gym that

1080
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:50,750
you can consume on-site I mean legally

1081
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:53,119
it's possible now I mean there's ways to

1082
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,130
do it and it call it a cigar room style

1083
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,319
where it's separated and ventilated so I

1084
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:59,420
mean we were legally able to potentially

1085
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,580
do what we did we were unable to open

1086
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,880
the gym due to some regulatory stuff

1087
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:04,318
outside of that

1088
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,630
the inability to really have a pretty

1089
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,038
large capital raise that it was right

1090
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,599
when Trump and sessions kind of came

1091
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:12,059
into office which kind of killed our

1092
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,710
raise from some more traditional VCS

1093
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:16,079
that we're gonna get into the game but

1094
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:17,519
you know legally it's there's a lot of

1095
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,470
things you got to jump through but

1096
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:21,508
there's ways to do it now if you wanted

1097
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:23,608
to do that so I mean if you want to open

1098
00:41:21,509 --> 00:41:26,940
a cannabis gym give me a call and you

1099
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:30,778
still trying to do it I'm awesome

1100
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:33,329
smoking ice hockey rink I love that so

1101
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:35,548
this questions for Nick so you mentioned

1102
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:38,068
that during training camp and before and

1103
00:41:35,548 --> 00:41:39,599
over the summer you stay clean unless

1104
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:42,389
you're tested did you notice that

1105
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,210
recovery time from being hit or having

1106
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:49,379
some of the concussion-like symptoms was

1107
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:51,539
more or less after using cannabis and

1108
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,490
CBD see I didn't have too much head

1109
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:55,380
trauma so as far as offseason when I had

1110
00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:56,909
to actually stop smoking I felt more of

1111
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,890
the effects with my training like as far

1112
00:41:56,909 --> 00:42:02,159
as my recovery and my rest that's when I

1113
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:03,929
felt like me I personally I like smoke

1114
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,969
on my way to working out like I was

1115
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:08,278
smoking like right before I get there

1116
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:09,808
and that's kind of gets me am i right

1117
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:11,068
mental state like I actually feel like I

1118
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:12,599
breathe the better when I do I know it

1119
00:42:11,068 --> 00:42:19,048
sounds weird like when I don't smoke I

1120
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:21,390
feel like I can't breathe I had a

1121
00:42:19,048 --> 00:42:22,829
question given the fact that the

1122
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:25,318
professional organizations are not

1123
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:29,579
accepting abuse how do a fleet current

1124
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:31,230
athletes get educated on you know the

1125
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:33,059
the various effects of cannabis and what

1126
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,159
it can do for them is it more just like

1127
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:38,278
athletes sharing their personal stories

1128
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:40,649
in the locker room or how how did you

1129
00:42:38,278 --> 00:42:43,739
out of each of you start your your

1130
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:46,009
journey into you know researching the

1131
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:49,048
effects and what it might do for you I

1132
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:50,639
guess kind of once I actually got into

1133
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:52,949
the program I looked into it more deeply

1134
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,480
as far as like once they started making

1135
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:56,368
me like listen to them explain all the

1136
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,449
chemicals and stuff like that then I

1137
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:59,369
kind of understood like how would

1138
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:01,710
actually like helped me when I looked at

1139
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:04,009
it from the scientific perspective but

1140
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,009
like

1141
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:19,750
I mean that's a hard one right there

1142
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:21,730
actually it's kind of I mean I'm not I'm

1143
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:25,269
not an athlete but I can still tag in on

1144
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:27,250
on how I learned which is I mean

1145
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:29,849
probably by doing the wrong things

1146
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,929
sometimes like smoking too much and then

1147
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:33,670
coming back from that I mean I'm sure

1148
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:35,679
that it has to be something that a lot

1149
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:37,480
of people still do there wasn't the

1150
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,179
wealth of information available that

1151
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,860
there is like now and that there has

1152
00:43:40,179 --> 00:43:45,759
been in the last two or three years

1153
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:47,890
honestly I mean the market has changed

1154
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,960
so much and and the conversation has

1155
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:51,789
really shifted but I mean to start at

1156
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,280
least myself I mean I remember smoking

1157
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:55,869
my first my first bowl and and I was

1158
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,460
like okay this is interesting and then

1159
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:58,900
somebody would give me a different you

1160
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,970
know some purple and I was like oh this

1161
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,160
is way this is not what I just smoked

1162
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:05,469
last week and and that's it's trial and

1163
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:07,210
error and then hopefully learning from

1164
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:09,399
your mistakes and also sharing the

1165
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:11,980
information with your friends in general

1166
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,010
education is probably one of the biggest

1167
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:17,619
issues in the industry anywhere and not

1168
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,900
just for consumers on the street even

1169
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:21,759
major politicians don't know it is going

1170
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,789
on so I think in general that

1171
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,170
information is is critical and we've

1172
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:29,110
invested in some companies recently

1173
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:30,909
there's a WebMD of cannabis we think is

1174
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:34,329
really good so I think there's more

1175
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:36,549
information tools to come but just

1176
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:38,409
understanding what is happening is

1177
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:40,390
probably the most important answer we

1178
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:42,009
can give you I mean for example we

1179
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:43,089
invested a lot of insurance companies I

1180
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:47,020
don't know does anyone have life

1181
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:49,390
insurance here okay has anyone tried to

1182
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:52,659
get life insurance while you're smoking

1183
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:55,809
cannabis and get tested for it right I

1184
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:57,759
mean it used to be life insurance you

1185
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:59,199
would get denied if they found cannabis

1186
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,180
in your system and in every other way

1187
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:04,689
you were healthy right which is absurd

1188
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:07,029
now they time they penalize you

1189
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:10,409
basically somewhere between if you're a

1190
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:14,050
tobacco user or an extreme alcohol user

1191
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:15,489
but they'll give it to you and you think

1192
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,970
about these insurance companies the

1193
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:19,549
resources they have and to not

1194
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:21,348
educated enough to know that you're

1195
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,630
telling me I can't get insurance because

1196
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:27,500
if I don't even consume alcohol or

1197
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:29,960
tobacco and/or opioids but I use a

1198
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,789
natural plata product to sleep or my

1199
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,500
pain that you're gonna penalize me on my

1200
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:35,659
life insurers to take care of my family

1201
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,309
I mean there's things that are just

1202
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:38,750
crazy they're getting better they're

1203
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:40,789
starting to get smarter but it's an

1204
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,019
institutional thing as far as she said

1205
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:43,460
as far as the trial in there I think

1206
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:46,250
that's definitely a big one as far as

1207
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,570
myself I kind of learned that edibles

1208
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,309
are another good way I like to kind of

1209
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:51,289
medicate before physical activity like

1210
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:53,269
playing the game because I know it would

1211
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:54,349
last longer so I could be the Edible for

1212
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:55,670
the game it would last me the whole game

1213
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:56,660
or if I just smoked the blood it would

1214
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,639
only kind of last me kind of like

1215
00:45:56,659 --> 00:46:00,079
through the first quarter and then you

1216
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:01,759
kind of learn from the older guys to

1217
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,380
like when you're first coming in you

1218
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,150
like kind of art like how do I do this

1219
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,710
like how do I like make sure I can like

1220
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,108
get out before the game and like I don't

1221
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:10,608
get caught in like I can make sure I get

1222
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:12,230
my stuff with me so you kind of learn

1223
00:46:10,608 --> 00:46:14,420
from other guys they teach you how to go

1224
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:16,010
about it and as far as they actually

1225
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,440
learning what the plant does to you like

1226
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,820
now it's just get to the point now where

1227
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,170
more guys are open to it so like now

1228
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,820
it's like I've always been known to the

1229
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,230
younger guys under me in college and

1230
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,809
guys are played with like I was already

1231
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:28,420
smoker so guys that didn't smoke or

1232
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:30,469
didn't smoke as much they're looking to

1233
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,730
hearing more the medical benefits they

1234
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:33,169
want to know more so they want to talk

1235
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,490
to somebody else that actually does it I

1236
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,079
get more people coming to be

1237
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:38,059
face-to-face specially training in Miami

1238
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,949
where I train at and with my trainer

1239
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:41,659
Bommarito and my doctors I go to that do

1240
00:46:39,949 --> 00:46:44,838
like the stem cell therapy and the pro

1241
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:46,159
lobe and the nutrient Ivy's so it's kind

1242
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:48,469
of everybody else all at the same time

1243
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,789
is trying to gain interest in and so at

1244
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:51,469
the same time athletes are learning

1245
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:53,779
about it more than medical professionals

1246
00:46:51,469 --> 00:46:55,279
that look into not the traditional

1247
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,510
methods of healing like the surgeries

1248
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,780
and the injections were more the

1249
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:01,310
homeopathic they're kind of helping us

1250
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:05,599
educate as well too because they're

1251
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:09,500
learning at the same time I guess this

1252
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,580
question is more for Eliza it's it's

1253
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:14,030
really cool to hear your guys

1254
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:16,309
experiences on on the professional field

1255
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:19,880
but you know I don't I'm not an NFL

1256
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:21,199
player I don't know if you could tell so

1257
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,570
I was hoping to hear a little bit more

1258
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,309
about how you suggest we incorporate

1259
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:28,580
cannabis into you know like normal

1260
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:30,440
people fitness totally yeah I mean well

1261
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:32,480
so we did ask the question who

1262
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,130
zooms cannabis before workout can can I

1263
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,900
just see a show of hands who uses it

1264
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:41,510
after ok a little bit more than the

1265
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:43,220
before so that's awesome so there are

1266
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:46,010
three ways to like use cannabis right so

1267
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:48,529
you can consume it you can inhale it or

1268
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:50,240
you can apply it so topicals in other

1269
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:52,310
words so the first thing is just

1270
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:54,019
educating people about those three

1271
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:57,019
different modes of application and

1272
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:59,088
understanding how they can be used it

1273
00:47:57,019 --> 00:48:00,619
really depends on the activity there are

1274
00:47:59,088 --> 00:48:02,739
certain activities that I personally

1275
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:05,750
wouldn't recommend using cannabis

1276
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:07,959
beforehand because of just you know

1277
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:10,010
sometimes things are dangerous so

1278
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,050
certain people when they're lifting

1279
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:14,569
superly no weights and stuff I wouldn't

1280
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,980
recommend high THC because your muscles

1281
00:48:14,568 --> 00:48:18,318
do get a little bit more relaxed and

1282
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,179
somebody I've got somebody laughing over

1283
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:23,989
here because obviously he's done it once

1284
00:48:20,179 --> 00:48:26,239
or twice but so that's one one thing to

1285
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:27,828
be aware of but once again educating

1286
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:30,828
yourself and learning about these

1287
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:32,300
products starting with micro doses this

1288
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:35,480
is something that I teach in my class is

1289
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:36,740
all of the time micro dosing which means

1290
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,409
that you're using less than a medicinal

1291
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:41,568
dose so start with 2 to 3 to 5

1292
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:43,338
milligrams and then work your way up

1293
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:45,949
from there really give your body and

1294
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:48,769
yourself a chance to understand how your

1295
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:51,078
body interacts with this medicine and

1296
00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:53,000
and also just understanding that you

1297
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:55,880
want to find the least amount necessary

1298
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,608
to get the desired effect which is

1299
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,289
something we don't really see very often

1300
00:48:58,608 --> 00:49:01,730
in the pharmaceutical industry it's like

1301
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:03,199
they're like we want to make sure we

1302
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,389
eradicate that so we're gonna give you

1303
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,250
three times the normal dose to make sure

1304
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:09,618
that you don't need to come back no no

1305
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:11,719
no we want to start with once again the

1306
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:15,588
least amount necessary for that desired

1307
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:18,559
effect you want to allow yourself to to

1308
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:21,679
find space and to really find that time

1309
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,690
to focus with the ouka classes weed is

1310
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:25,639
awesome before a good yoga practice or

1311
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,260
meditation even and really getting into

1312
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:29,029
your body because when people are on

1313
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:32,000
their Maps in my classes it's called

1314
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:33,589
bendin blaze so people they think they

1315
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,420
need to get blazed and when I say no I

1316
00:49:33,588 --> 00:49:37,068
want you to get lifted I don't want you

1317
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,680
to get high there's a big difference

1318
00:49:37,068 --> 00:49:41,150
between high and lifted and I want you

1319
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:42,108
to find that in-between space where you

1320
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:44,660
feel enlightened

1321
00:49:42,108 --> 00:49:46,730
and as opposed to feeling stoned and

1322
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:48,649
like you need to lie down so there's a

1323
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,088
few different ways to apply it I don't

1324
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:52,130
know if I answered your question but I

1325
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,808
think it's important to talk about it

1326
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:56,019
and for anybody who's interested in

1327
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:58,278
applying cannabis to their practice or

1328
00:49:56,018 --> 00:49:59,659
day-to-day activity please find me later

1329
00:49:58,278 --> 00:50:01,730
I'd love to talk to you about what

1330
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:03,679
you're doing and how we can enhance it

1331
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:05,838
and and and also solve any issues that

1332
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,998
you may have in your day to day I like

1333
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:12,858
lifted week I call it activated it's

1334
00:50:07,998 --> 00:50:14,538
kind of our term for it so as we close

1335
00:50:12,858 --> 00:50:16,159
up there's there's something I kind of

1336
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:18,140
like to close up on and I like to bring

1337
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,639
cannabis into a bigger picture and a

1338
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:22,219
bigger discussion and not just talk

1339
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:23,748
about it is like to get high cannabis is

1340
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:25,699
part of our lifes whether you're an

1341
00:50:23,748 --> 00:50:29,538
athlete or not to be well and to be

1342
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:31,308
happy I started this off by saying you

1343
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:34,489
know marijuana used to be a drug and it

1344
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:36,380
was bad but really it's it's a medicine

1345
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:39,650
cannabis is a medicine that makes us

1346
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:41,390
better people and we should look at not

1347
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:43,548
only cannabis cannabis is a plant

1348
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:47,058
everything we put in our body so food is

1349
00:50:43,548 --> 00:50:49,759
medicine and America looks at medicine

1350
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:53,150
as what I think of as a drug which is a

1351
00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:56,239
white pill and medicine and a pill or

1352
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:58,009
excuse me drugs or a pill that's trying

1353
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,230
to fix something that was bad decisions

1354
00:50:58,009 --> 00:51:01,998
made over a lot of years and I think

1355
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:04,099
that you know if we can use cannabis in

1356
00:51:01,998 --> 00:51:06,498
a lifestyle of wellness eating right

1357
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:08,900
thinking about what we put into our body

1358
00:51:06,498 --> 00:51:11,268
what kind of cannabis we use when we use

1359
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,309
it how we use it I just want everybody

1360
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:14,808
to think about mindful cannabis use

1361
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:16,039
especially as an athlete because if

1362
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:18,109
you're gonna use cannabis and you're

1363
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:20,239
gonna go out and you're gonna go surf in

1364
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:21,619
a big wave or do whatever you want to be

1365
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,989
on your game you don't want to get hurt

1366
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:25,608
and same thing in life so be mindful

1367
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:27,108
with your cannabis use find out what

1368
00:51:25,608 --> 00:51:27,980
works for you it's not the same for

1369
00:51:27,108 --> 00:51:29,420
