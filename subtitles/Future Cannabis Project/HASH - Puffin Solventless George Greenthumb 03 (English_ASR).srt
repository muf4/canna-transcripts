1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,279
[Music]

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,379
yeah let's do one more let's do it at

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,320
his big temp let's go for a 20 grammar

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,900
you want to do a 20 grammar at 210 yeah

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,210
or maybe go up not to 10 was actually

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,830
really good I think that was a good temp

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,240
you see if you can I would squeeze the

8
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,169
plates together right now and just make

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,169
sure they're nice and hot

10
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,129
what's weird those when you're coming

11
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:32,729
down you almost don't know when you're

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:38,670
at the bottom of the press of the yeah I

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:44,479
kept pressing yeah I was doing that too

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:49,530
it has like I feel like wrote a line a

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:54,859
little beep are you ready for yours all

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,859
right so I like to see no quitters

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:13,859
got a little smoke on that one yeah I

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,590
have not messed around with dry SIP

19
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:23,489
triceps super gnarly and a totally

20
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:24,450
different process I I like working with

21
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:26,459
water

22
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,540
I do tricep completely solve them this

23
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:33,780
would be the dry sift Mac I want to say

24
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,280
nice but yeah a lot of my drive shift

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,890
you can't tell the difference from the

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,269
ispotter hash so I'll label you know

27
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,310
I'll label it so you know the difference

28
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,310
check that up yeah they got a I'm sorry

29
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:56,450
that's that's the that's the Mac married

30
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:12,180
this and this is a dry sister they tend

31
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,150
to be a little bit darker you got plant

32
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,790
contamination factors because it's dry

33
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,739
but you give you done the UM the paint

34
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:22,259
roller and the parchment tuck yet I

35
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,959
haven't gotten to that not on that there

36
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,209
definitely help there's some better ones

37
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,890
I'm getting better at it you know but it

38
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,989
does still put out some nice ones these

39
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:33,149
are some different older ones you can

40
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:51,060
tell but there's some other ones that I

41
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:53,269
have but I'm alright you should be good

42
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,269
to go

43
00:02:53,969 --> 00:03:04,610
I was perfect go I'd blow that out

44
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:16,789
that's that watermelon one Wow Wow

45
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:20,269
that coated my mouth on the second hit

46
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:20,269
holy crap

47
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:29,120
we killed Pete everybody ooh sorry Peter

48
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,979
one of my fun or Tuesday nights I've had

49
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:52,549
in a while

50
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:54,289
thank you Matt so I didn't bring the

51
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,560
other part to this so I'm gonna do what

52
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:59,650
I can and get it pressed with this guy

53
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,920
just I don't have the matching piece

54
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:06,349
doesn't help yeah I have the other part

55
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,869
but again I didn't I was in a hurry I

56
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:17,540
forgot a lot I keep finding more stuff

57
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:27,350
that I forgot I forgot that too huh this

58
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:31,250
is 20 gram generally yeah to get to get

59
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:33,740
all of that out yes yes and that's where

60
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:37,310
I didn't get the maximum yield on that

61
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,370
it was a 10 gram puck and I didn't apply

62
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:43,370
enough pressure could you repress that

63
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:47,449
bag yes because it was only at 180

64
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:51,560
degrees you got a lot of cushion for

65
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:52,399
mistake so I I'm I look I play on the

66
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,310
safe side

67
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,349
not that that his is not safe he likes

68
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,509
that that's what he does so that's the

69
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,040
right way it's not you know nobody does

70
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,909
it the wrong way everybody if you're

71
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,060
doing it that's the right way you know

72
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:17,330
so we all have different techniques and

73
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:19,160
that's what's cool all right that's the

74
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:21,349
best little puck I can make for that oh

75
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,860
I got to get one of those embers I'm

76
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,689
jealous now do you get that a blowout

77
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,030
effect with these or you double bag

78
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:31,029
still huh you double bag I double back

79
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:45,338
we get all those textures I wonder if I

80
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:49,628
folded it up in here how would play out

81
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:51,218
in one bag if we would bust it don't

82
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:53,620
look at me man that's your call

83
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:56,079
I'm not that's your hash all that you'll

84
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:04,809
be making kid no suggestions for me so

85
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:09,490
you yell at me 20 minutes I know your

86
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:11,199
tricks this is good parchment though

87
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,930
this is gnarly parchment I love how

88
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,848
thick it is that's important especially

89
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,098
on the higher temperature yeah I use a

90
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:20,288
much I use a much thicker parchment that

91
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:22,688
I get off of Amazon it's freaking gnarly

92
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:24,158
and I and then and there knowing how to

93
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:25,479
cut your parchment getting all that

94
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:27,278
stuff right that's all something you got

95
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:29,860
a dial in this is what I use but I can't

96
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:31,538
use it at high temps no that's the

97
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,889
difference so again it comes down to

98
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:35,498
what is you what are you doing

99
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:38,168
and I don't like the thick parchment

100
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:41,110
because it takes heat away it actually

101
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:43,748
absorbs heat so it's on big plates helps

102
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,088
yeah so if you have thicker paper and I

103
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:47,770
go in at 180 it's not 180 on this

104
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:50,319
material anymore because it has to heat

105
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:52,748
through that paper so to get it it's all

106
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,770
on how you like to do your thing you

107
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:56,039
have those are the things you got to

108
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:56,038
consider

109
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,430
you just kind of like this cheater clip

110
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:11,409
it and then and then squish it and then

111
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,850
it'll stay in place for a little bit no

112
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,380
like you're not going to believe that

113
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,330
while you're squishing no no that's it

114
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,620
giving me yeah just like exactly like a

115
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:18,849
little money here that's super rat

116
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,990
that's so nice

117
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:24,640
that's just my little yeah fingers when

118
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,379
I finish this fold as that's when it

119
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,699
goes in and then I remove the clip oh

120
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,699
okay gotcha

121
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:33,550
gives me time and I'll prep all my pucks

122
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:36,519
just like this so I'll sit there two of

123
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,889
us and just start do one dudes work in

124
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:41,139
the pucks and I'm doing all the folding

125
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:44,469
so cuz it takes if you can roll joint

126
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:46,810
I'm a drunk so I like to you could do

127
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,960
this but if you can fold joints you're

128
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,629
gonna snowman I've I'm totally different

129
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:55,479
like I I use my I use the the priests

130
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:58,689
own bags I have like a fill like a cone

131
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,780
filler you know funnel I just have a

132
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:05,889
spoon I just dump it in way I'm out see

133
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:09,669
that they're about even 22 22 grams this

134
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:10,899
is what I'm doing per bag and then and

135
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,759
then I just sit there and I'm like

136
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:14,829
holding the bag and like whipping it you

137
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,259
know trying to get all the hash to the

138
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:20,050
seams all the corners press with my hand

139
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:22,689
a little bit double bag it and pre-press

140
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:27,610
it and throw it on over on the regular

141
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:28,600
press this is ready to go for sure this

142
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,900
thing's actually pretty cool though I

143
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,519
just noticed that the arm Springs this

144
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:35,889
helps a lot that helps balance your

145
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,750
plate reloading of it

146
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:39,759
the worst thing you get is when the

147
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,789
plates are all tweaked this slide your

148
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:45,669
stuff over unless you have the like

149
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,559
Peaks press where it self automatically

150
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:50,279
adjusts cuz their plate naturally comes

151
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,279
down at an angle

152
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,960
that the whole thing is a computer you

153
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:20,980
tell it what to do and it executes your

154
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:25,340
commands so this is like twice as much

155
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:30,159
yeah this should really squirt yeah

156
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,160
being good at ornament origami will help

157
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:36,319
you know honesty I would sit there and

158
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,840
take screenshots of people that I would

159
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,670
see doing it live just so I could try to

160
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,649
zoom in and figure out how the hell that

161
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:44,719
they were folding their parchment paper

162
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,549
while they were squishing seeing that

163
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,960
they were getting good returns were they

164
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:50,959
doing double parchment paper

165
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,430
what was the inside of that yeah

166
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,050
everybody's a little differently can you

167
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:56,989
double barking up this temp yeah a

168
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:59,539
double parchment always every time and

169
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,430
in all reality it's even even more

170
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:05,349
because of the way I folded it's on top

171
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:10,219
of itself so I would say even maybe like

172
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:13,810
tripled in a production mines and that's

173
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,960
how I'm like where our facility will be

174
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:19,459
operationally

175
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,340
so they account everything how many

176
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,960
papers we have to go through how many

177
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:29,090
bags so those are those are things that

178
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:31,460
it's that reason of why I use certain

179
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:35,240
things is that there's so many expenses

180
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:37,550
involved with licensing with taxations

181
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,470
with distribution fees you know all

182
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:41,839
these fees that come out of the end

183
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,720
product which ultimately the consumer

184
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,000
pays so if we can minimize many of those

185
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,000
these extra little tin mines it's just

186
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,919
my thought process doesn't mean it's

187
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,049
right doesn't mean it's wrong it's just

188
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,349
that that's that's the way that my mind

189
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:58,459
is stopped

190
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,460
[Applause]

191
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:16,569
so nice and long this is what he pressed

192
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:19,899
and mines down there all right you want

193
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:25,379
to try to tap Iman yeah usually without

194
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:25,379
yours we'll do it all right

195
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,290
see if we could copy this it was a

196
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,299
little buttery but it's it still was

197
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:57,549
very stable and gooey and held together

198
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:59,079
really well so you might be able to pull

199
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:03,159
it and get a different consistency and a

200
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:06,940
really good solid color like where

201
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:09,819
there's no like drinking in it

202
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,700
yeah it takes more work when there's

203
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:16,440
cake in it so that's why I'm a big like

204
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:20,940
try not to make it right any more work

205
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,999
more time more blending and it's in time

206
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,999
[Music]

207
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:34,750
all right this is a modification of

208
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,340
whatever we're going to try to do the

209
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,340
grip is done best we can

210
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,340
quickness

211
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:49,019
let me know if you need help all right

212
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,970
yes let's get this stuff laters yeah

213
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,039
awesome yeah and if you can go ahead and

214
00:12:50,970 --> 00:13:02,759
close up my clamps on my paper and folds

215
00:12:53,039 --> 00:13:10,069
don't come apart just a little thank you

216
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:10,069
stop right there

217
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:23,519
bunch of butts in your face and you just

218
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:26,490
go at it right no I slow I get it nice

219
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,110
and tight you get a nice little yeah I

220
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,120
get it nice and tight you know when you

221
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,500
feel it when you feel it pressing it and

222
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:40,350
then just go a little bit more I almost

223
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:41,610
let the weight of this do it man I

224
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,730
bought him down and I was still pushing

225
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,480
down yeah yeah we're still flowing now

226
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,420
and I we're flowing

227
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,970
oh yeah there we go Oh blow up hold on

228
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:57,689
reset which way forward not blow out but

229
00:13:50,970 --> 00:14:00,209
slide out because you're because of this

230
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:03,000
paper it started my bag started sliding

231
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:04,229
towards me so we're good we reset I just

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,269
had to set her back a little bit deeper

233
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,129
and that could be the that's the other

234
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:11,309
downside is the bigger plates they tend

235
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:13,350
to sometimes squeeze too forward like a

236
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:16,019
v-shape and pushes the bag towards me

237
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,909
because I like to see my edge so if like

238
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,389
sometimes that happens but I think we're

239
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:26,328
okay now

240
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:26,328
we saved the switch yeah well I almost

241
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:39,149
told yous into here you were going too

242
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:42,299
far in oh yeah there's a block that's

243
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:44,909
what happens and I was you want me to do

244
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:49,769
20 grams real quick I'll rock that shit

245
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:52,860
fast you could still repress it pull

246
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:55,500
this off open it up put this bag into

247
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:01,340
another bag and that would even one bag

248
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:03,629
that's this is the 15 you single bag so

249
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,250
it also was sticking out the back a

250
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:06,689
little bit and it's because the plate is

251
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,860
so small if the plate was wider I

252
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:12,420
wouldn't have done that because it would

253
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:15,470
have been it was over the edge yeah so I

254
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:17,879
mean it's easy yeah and it's still able

255
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:21,710
take that it's still salvageable we

256
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:24,960
didn't we didn't we minimized the damage

257
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:28,320
that's a thing about the rose and as you

258
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,100
learn it blue yeah you can you can

259
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,370
minimize them

260
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,159
so obviously one screen is not ideal

261
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,500
yeah I'm always double bag morning you

262
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,029
know so something you got to figure out

263
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,519
and learn and these are the lessons that

264
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:44,009
we go through but it's it's I don't

265
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,860
think that I ruined it

266
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,840
so this is completely salvageable the

267
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,300
rosin itself is good oh that's so this

268
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,160
if I needed to you just open it up and

269
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,299
pour it into another bag however if the

270
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,909
yield is I would do it immediately

271
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,909
rameters there's no need to be pressure

272
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,779
that one you could probably just well

273
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:07,440
there's not much left look it's it's

274
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:08,309
almost see-through it's probably more

275
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,900
it's your call

276
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:11,279
I mean that's it's your hash I'm not I'm

277
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:16,459
not gonna nothing well let's check this

278
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,459
number yeah that's correct the squish I

279
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:22,169
don't know 120 grams I think it should

280
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,360
be a little more yeah well we didn't

281
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:25,829
finish it yeah well we were in like a

282
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,340
minute and a half yeah yeah I barely

283
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:32,190
went halfway through not even oh make

284
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,379
another one you sure I think I need

285
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,790
gloves don't even trip I'll let this

286
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,350
cool down there do your thing

287
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:40,049
this is just to cool down so they can't

288
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,470
touch it anyway good hash all over my

289
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:45,419
fingers and get angry and cranky

290
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:51,750
it drives me nuts dude literally batshit

291
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:54,120
crazy hash of my fingers is like sand on

292
00:16:51,750 --> 00:17:00,019
your feet you know walking into the

293
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,019
house can't do it I'll lose my mind

294
00:17:03,828 --> 00:17:14,250
wanna see this quickly to be this so

295
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:15,480
fast no problem because well not only

296
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,970
that but my fingers are already going

297
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:33,538
freakin numb with how small these phones

298
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:43,589
oh yeah big fat fingers this guy yeah

299
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:44,720
bigger one scale yeah this product is

300
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:50,490
all usable

301
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:52,700
I like you're throwing away that's for

302
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,700
sure

303
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:09,308
I feel like I could have fit 20 in those

304
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:11,980
225s did I get 225 s again yeah they're

305
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:14,019
a big baggy enough huh yeah yeah it was

306
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,470
actually it fit pretty well for the for

307
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:22,200
the nine will do will do nineteen sound

308
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,200
good sure it's just short of nineteen

309
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:28,649
screw it oh and make it almost 20

310
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,608
[Applause]

311
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:57,869
got out the way all right now - now to

312
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:59,879
form this little pucky getting it a

313
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:03,089
little bit warm so you can make it

314
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:07,909
malleable and I want it to go in one of

315
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:07,908
these bags right here manual hand press

316
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:22,319
least ideal most amount of actual

317
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:27,330
physical labor why cuz he had ton of

318
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:31,950
passion isn't now yeah that's gonna make

319
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:33,388
your tongue no just the try cutter in

320
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:43,798
and it's just it's just yeah it just

321
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:44,729
makes it almost go numb like that it's

322
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:46,440
like a tingly

323
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,839
it's like a tingling effect like you

324
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,480
could even do it with BHO like when you

325
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:53,459
eat like a really strong BHO made edible

349
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,929
not too far up I I just only because

350
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:45,178
when I open and close my door the the

351
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:47,669
temperature fluctuates too much so I

352
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:50,370
don't like that I got a three and a half

353
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:52,590
ton mini split in the smallest room so

354
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:54,268
it just gets cold in a sec yeah I don't

355
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:58,069
have to worry about my door oh but I

356
00:21:54,269 --> 00:22:01,740
walk in and out to get warm I have a

357
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:04,109
keep my 55 is fine as long as the water

358
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:08,128
is moving in the waters ice cold it's

359
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:11,538
not gonna come up but but but 45 50

360
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:14,548
degrees is ideal for me is what I do so

361
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:21,109
there's the puck in there the folder

362
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:21,109
over slammer another one less less

363
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:29,899
making that perfect square is really

364
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:32,000
where it's so I can slide in without

365
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,710
these you'll notice that the bag folded

366
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,380
I don't like that I'm gonna actually go

367
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:42,650
back and fix it if I ever see that I

368
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:44,450
want it to be perfect very flush even

369
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,550
that's a little funky but the way the

370
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,049
bag is and the way the Nugget or the the

371
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:52,399
hash is so sticky I don't really have

372
00:22:48,049 --> 00:23:03,859

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:52,550
this this ready just wider than your

401
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,549
when your puffs you're about to press

402
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:04,058

403
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:30,339

406
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:36,808
awesome you can even view it from here

407
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:39,038
if you want to come in with the camera

408
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:41,759
and I'll get out of the way of the light

409
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:41,759
I'll see if I can

410
00:26:54,650 --> 00:27:01,340
it's already starting to ooze this might

411
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:05,180
really squirt out you might want to have

412
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:23,599
a piece of parchment yeah grab that half

413
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:26,740
one that I just it's a boy I just don't

414
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,740
want the bags to burst

415
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:44,429
the plates are so check out what I found

416
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:50,449
on the back what no that's just blow out

417
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:50,450
blow up from the last time we're good

418
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:05,038
feel like it should have been a little

419
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,860
hotter for that size huh yeah you're

420
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:10,259
double the amount it's still squeeze

421
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:19,019
looks a longer press then right still

422
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:21,329
squeezing it's hard to get down all

423
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:24,778
right yeah and I just really don't blow

424
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:27,210
it out or fucking knock it over this got

425
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:33,679
two challenges against you I'm really

426
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:33,679
watching the back she's still in there

427
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,400
[Music]

428
00:28:46,609 --> 00:29:04,189
yeah you got them this is a two-man

429
00:28:49,169 --> 00:29:04,190
press right that's a workout huh

430
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:14,340
leverage that's the that's there's no

431
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:19,250
leverage to old for the shit piece all

432
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:27,058
you got a big old tongue huh looks good

433
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:31,950
nice no blow no you're good go for maybe

434
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:33,778
another like 30 seconds 320 so it comes

435
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:37,319
out and then it's cool so that's why

436
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:44,298
it's stopped yeah that stuff's probably

437
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:46,558
almost stable already yeah circulation I

438
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:49,259
can scoop it up it's over here and we're

439
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,609
gonna try to tap in yours right you're

440
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:53,929
just ready to do that

441
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:53,928
well that's doing that

442
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:07,490
I can feel right now that there's still

443
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:11,250
a lot left in the bag to my arms like

444
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:13,649
totally jelly you were putting pressure

445
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,390
knew there was no joke this heavy duty

446
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:21,778
that would get tiring that's the quite a

447
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:23,130
bit but for a home use someone who

448
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,619
doesn't have a lot of material to press

449
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:29,429
you get over I take it back

450
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:38,278
that's pretty damn good nude yeah look

451
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:38,788
at that block at the front yeah there in

452
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:41,849
that bag

453
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:57,538
that's that big bag that one

454
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:59,099
yeah that's a little soft let's see

455
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:01,528
what's left

456
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:09,269
it feels pretty thick but it also feels

457
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:13,169
like we got a lot out so so 19 and a

458
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:18,298
half one in there's four and a half left

459
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:20,880
so 19 and a half one it's more than a

460
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:24,168
half there's 15 divided by 19 and a half

461
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,169
let's see that is

462
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:37,320
exactly the same 76

463
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:40,470
nailed it 77 actually it's just it's

464
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:45,240
just under 77 so yeah we crushed it

465
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:49,669
again did 20 grammar yeah this is a wet

466
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:54,359
one yeah look at her she's wet and gooey

467
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:57,059
this would be go right in the jar but

468
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:58,500
this is perfect for that go in a jar let

469
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:59,579
it sit for like two days and then I've

470
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:56,460
whipped the hell out of it and then it

471
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:59,099
would be like nice creamy I mean this

472
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:02,038
one needs to cool off before you can

473
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:05,158
touch like this is gonna close did you

474
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:07,169

486
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:38,349
alcohol and try to clean rises yeah your

487
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:43,299
fingers get sticky everything's gonna

488
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:49,719
get sticky that's the way it works we

489
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:52,480
don't have any more I'm turning the

490
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,259
press off yeah saving electricity job

491
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:02,620
good job

492
00:33:53,259 --> 00:34:04,240
press altum Utley they're gonna finish

493
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:06,699
differently they're gonna cure

494
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,559
differently different textures different

495
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,900
heats everything the same material

496
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,029
though different techniques that's

497
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,460
what's cool about you know hash and rose

498
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:18,340
and everybody can be creative with their

499
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:22,260
own techniques to create the hash and

500
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:24,309
then to press the hash there's different

501
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,220
hitting that big number and they're in

502
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:28,539
the 70s that's that's a great number

503
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:31,599
depending on the type of material you're

504
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:35,349
trying to create I chew for the 60 to 70

505
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,119
range like for example on my press

506
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:39,549
that's what this was at home this one

507
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,799
maybe want the 67 anyone throw well I'll

508
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,510
keep the puck where I like this texture

509
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,860
where I can actually use my fingers or

510
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:49,930
not you know not be so sticky on me yeah

511
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:53,230
it's definitely standard so it again

512
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:55,599
it's the preference of what you like to

513
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,760
do how you like to work what's your

514
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,929
style

515
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,770
don't let somebody tell you you're doing

516
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:02,259
it wrong

517
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:04,090
that's your choices man everyone

518
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,850
skateboards differently yeah you know it

519
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:09,789
hopefully they can tell you a better way

520
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:11,339
or another way versus you're doing it

521
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:13,779
wrong cuz that that's the easy way out

522
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,370
I'm not the guy that I don't like to

523
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,070
tell people hey dude your shit sucks

524
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:20,019
because it's that's not the truth you

525
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:22,660
know we don't have any the industry

526
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:25,239
doesn't have any industrial scale a hat

527
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:28,420
makers it really at this point does it

528
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:30,189
there's some there's some like Whistler

529
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,280
tech and those guys are carpooling up

530
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,260
those things machines

531
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,160
mmm there's a guy standing I'm like

532
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:40,520
stairway dumping really yeah it's insane

533
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:42,319
it's like looks like a mousetrap like

534
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:44,570
that we've got a game for game used to

535
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,090
play so is it just like the same process

536
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:50,990
but its scale its massive it's almost

537
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:53,240
like a giant just stilling so when

538
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:55,489
you're going wrong on air this takes you

539
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:58,069
much higher yeah they're probably

540
00:35:55,489 --> 00:36:01,699
processing huge outdoor farm stuff like

541
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:03,710
that biomass biomass yeah yeah I

542
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:07,369
wouldn't but it's not it's not going to

543
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:11,780
be anywhere near the quality of my

544
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:14,329
personal growth yeah absolutely I mean

545
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:17,150
you probably could I mean you probably

546
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:19,849
have to cut down like a 20 lighter and

547
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,050
then process them out of money that

548
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:22,759
you're throwing into that thing you

549
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:26,120
better hope that machine works right you

550
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:41,420
better hope your return you're risking a

551
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:43,849
lot as my monetary loss is such a

552
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,240
hands-on demo finish off where we

553
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:46,239
started
