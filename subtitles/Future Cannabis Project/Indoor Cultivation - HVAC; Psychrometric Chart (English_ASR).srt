2
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:12,210
little secular we spend a lot of time as

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,759
engineers using this tool this device

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,359
which discusses the properties of air

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,039
and the water in the air and we use it

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,500
to figure out how to condition that air

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:27,210
whether it's meeting cooling humidifying

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,730
dehumidifier this chart comes from many

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,880
many hundreds of thousands of points of

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,219
data that are collected in the field to

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,620
generate this chart and it all has to do

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,570
with how much air is in the water and

13
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,308
how we go from one temperature of air or

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,980
one humidification point of air to

15
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,209
another so let's talk about the chart

16
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,479
you know you should all have a

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,149
handy-dandy inspire psychometric chart

18
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:55,019
in your hands let's talk about some of

19
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,670
the different axes so this is our chart

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,399
along the bottom you're gonna find the

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,010
dry bulb temperature dry bulb

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:06,269
temperature you're gonna find the wet

23
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:08,340
bulb temperature in a diagonal from the

24
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,590
bottom right hand corner of the chart to

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,900
the top left-hand corner of the chart in

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,840
green lines you're gonna find the dew

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,000
point temperature as an axis here along

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,009
the y axis of the chart on the right

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,109
hand side you're gonna find relative

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,090
humidity as swooping lines starting from

31
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:27,209
100 which is the very top of this chart

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,040
along this swooping line to 0 percent

33
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:31,679
relative humidity along with this flat

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,618
line and the swooping lines that are

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,170
connected in between are all the

36
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,879
relative Commedia lines and then allows

37
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,340
me to find is the humidity ratio so

38
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,399
humidity ratio also runs along this axis

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,590
here it's this axis right here is the

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,829
humidity ratio it deals with the amount

41
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,609
of water in air

42
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:52,648
alright let's talk about what Elly's

43
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:54,929
done with all these different terms me a

44
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,728
dry bulb thermometer is the thermometer

45
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:58,679
you might be used to when someone took

46
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,810
your temperature as a kid this is a

47
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:03,569
thermometer that when waved around in

48
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,478
the air it is dry on the outside this

49
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:08,789
bulb right here is dry and it is

50
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,180
measuring what we call the sensible

51
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:14,609
energy of the air it is the dry bulb

52
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,080
temperature of the air any time you want

53
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,760
to use this chart you can use one of

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,879
these thermometers to measure the air

55
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,378
you're trying to put on the chart wave

56
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,389
it around the in that air and it'll tell

57
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:26,878
you where you should be along this axis

58
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:29,729
the next couple of tools will help us

59
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:33,870
figure out how far up we go on this axis

60
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:35,609
to find our place on the chart so we've

61
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,039
got dry bulb now we have a wet bulb

62
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,170
thermometer very similar device in fact

63
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,389
it's the exact same device except there

64
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:44,818
is a sock at the end of it that is

65
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,798
soaking wet okay

66
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,419
why do we do that well the wet bulb

67
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,909
thermometer is going to find another

68
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,750
point on this chart and it's gonna tell

69
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:56,579
us the rate at which the water is

70
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,919
evaporating off of the sock and in doing

71
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:01,069
so bring down the temperature of the

72
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,439
bulb which is encased in that wet sock

73
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:06,000
so I want to find out the wet bulb

74
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,848
temperature of some air I need to

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,039
measure I'm gonna take this wet sock

76
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:12,899
sling it around inside my room that I'm

77
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,298
trying to measure and the temperature I

78
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,180
read on this chart will give us the

79
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,489
second point along the wet bulb lines

80
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,650
and between the two points I now know

81
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:27,239
where we are on the chart that is

82
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,370
because of the evaporative cooling

83
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,259
effect of water same reason that we

84
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,789
sweat and we get hot the same reason

85
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:37,530
that plants transpire when they're

86
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:40,798
exposed to radiation okay so let's talk

87
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,840
about why the dew points relevant we

88
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,659
have this dew point on the chart right

89
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,209
here this is something you'll see every

90
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,939
day on the nightly news they'll talk

91
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,560
about the dew point temperature

92
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,840
as we go into our overnight condition

93
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,379
what they're really concerned about is

94
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,289
if the temperature of the air gets below

95
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:02,990
this number that we call the dew point

96
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:04,939
we are going to have condensation come

97
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,750
out of the air and on to the surface

98
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:12,020
that is at or below that - so when you

99
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,000
repeat that the dew point is the

100
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,840
temperature at which condensation will

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,149
occur so if I take a can of coke out of

102
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,609
a fridge and it's below the dew point of

103
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:25,370
the air that we've plotted using our dry

104
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,949
bulb and wet ball thermometers that can

105
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,470
of coke being below the dew point will

106
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:32,209
condense moisture on its surface this is

107
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,190
the principle by which most mechanical

108
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:37,219
cooling is done and most mechanical

109
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:39,610
dehumidification is done as well yes

110
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,610
question

111
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:53,970
great question a dewpoint is a measure

112
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,769
of absolute humidity any line that goes

113
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,770
directly up and down here any access

114
00:04:55,769 --> 00:05:00,689
that is on the y axis of this chart is a

115
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:03,389
measure or reference for absolute

116
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:06,478
humidity but one of the things you

117
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:10,168
should note is that it is a it is a

118
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:13,949
useful tool rather than an absolute

119
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:16,049
measure of a physical property so for

120
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:19,080
example and I probably did more that

121
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,810
right but then right next time so as an

122
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,000
example we're about to talk about the

123
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,819
humidity ratio which is an actual

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,288
measurement of the amount of water in

125
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,168
the air if we could collect it all

126
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:34,829
inside of a pound of air which takes up

127
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:36,810
about 13 cubic square feet if we take

128
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:41,399
all the water in that and measure it out

129
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:42,780
and plot whatever point we're at on that

130
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,239
humidity ratio we'll find out exactly

131
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:48,149
how many grains of water which are of

132
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:56,879
course out of 7,000 pound we'll find out

133
00:05:48,149 --> 00:06:00,750
how many grains of what are inside okay

134
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:04,288
so do occurs when surfaces reach the dew

135
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,959
point temperature inside fog occurs when

136
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:09,899
the air is saturated so if we happen to

137
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:13,310
hit that magical condition in Santa Cruz

138
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:17,638
all summer long when the temperature is

139
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:19,589
60 degrees Fahrenheit and the air coming

140
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,220
in off the ocean has been cooled down to

141
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:24,899
60 degrees the moisture being at a

142
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,830
hundred percent doesn't pick up all that

143
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:33,329
water off the ocean rolls in his father

144
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:34,948
so fog is air which is saturated with

145
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:36,930
water and can no longer hold anywhere

146
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,478
water if I try to mist water into it

147
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,009
that water would beat up form raindrops

148
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,709
and fall out

149
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:47,139
so that one other measure we want to

150
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:48,998
talk about is the relative humidity so

151
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,460
let's talk about what motive humidity is

152
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:53,559
we see these swooping lines this bottom

153
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:55,688
one here is zero and then they start

154
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:59,319
swooping up from zero all the way to a

155
00:06:55,689 --> 00:07:01,270
hundred it's very important to know that

156
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,848
the relative humidity is the amount of

157
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:06,278
moisture that's in a given amount of air

158
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:09,968
over the amount of moisture that the

159
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:13,259
given amount of air can hold it is not a

160
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:16,569
measure of how much of the air is water

161
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,520
if you take a look at the humidity ratio

162
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:20,468
which will describe shortly you'll find

163
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,269
out very quickly that at a hundred

164
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:24,038
percent relative humidity we're not

165
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:28,658
talking more than a percent or two of

166
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:31,329
actual water molecules versus the rest

167
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:32,680
of the air molecules around it so a

168
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:35,498
hundred percent relative humidity is

169
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:40,300
only one or two percent of water in the

170
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:42,520
air does that word follow that 100

171
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,439
percent relative humidity is a measure

172
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,528
of the humidity carrying the water

173
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:49,749
carrying capacity of air not of the

174
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:52,649
amount of water that makes up the air

175
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:52,649
okay

176
00:07:54,139 --> 00:08:03,079
so if I have a given volume of air and I

177
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:04,460
put in 50% of what it can hold I have a

178
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,469
50% relative humidity

179
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:08,750
if I have saturated in air if I go into

180
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:12,200
a cloud and take a measure of how much

181
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:14,990
water is in that volume of air I will

182
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,180
find that I could not put any more water

183
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,800
into that air this is what clouds are

184
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,840
this is what fog is this is what a

185
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,009
misting system creates it creates a

186
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:27,319
hundred percent Bills of humidity so now

187
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,789
let's talk about the humidity ratio so

188
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,560
let's say I was gonna take that and

189
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,539
follow you of air which was that 50 or

190
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,320
100 percent relative humidity and

191
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:38,689
squeeze out the cloud squeeze out all

192
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,320
the water from that particular volume

193
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:45,410
and then weigh the water

194
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,010
versus the weight of the air the

195
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:52,159
humidity ratio is a weight divided by a

196
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:54,819
weight the humidity ratio is grains

197
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:58,669
which is a unit of measure for weight

198
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:02,450
grades of water divided by pounds water

199
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:06,370
it is grains per pound grains of water

200
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:08,600
per pound of air does everyone follow

201
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,970
there's other numbers that exist for

202
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,250
this as well anytime you see humidity

203
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,740
ratio you can expect it to be a mass

204
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,559
over a mass or a weight over a week so

205
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,769
you may have grams per kilogram you may

206
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,509
have pounds per pound you know pounds

207
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,389
per pound well you've got very very very

208
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:28,519
small numbers so the humidity ratio that

209
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:30,139
we work with which is greens / pounds

210
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,600
just happens to give us some numbers

211
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:36,230
that are in our tangible reach they're

212
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,120
not 5 6 decimal places they're not in

213
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,639
the hundreds of thousands or millions

214
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,789
they just exist in a very small number

215
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,649
that is useful for us to use okay we've

216
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:46,879
talked about this entire chart you know

217
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,860
everything there is to know about

218
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:52,309
finding your way around this chart

219
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,740
except to say that things change air

220
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:58,309
changes temperature changes humidity

221
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,470
so let's talk a little bit about what we

222
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:03,889
can do with this information to figure

223
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:07,790
out where we're gonna go and apply it in

224
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:11,199
our growers let's start by finding our

225
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:13,490
way onto a specific point on the turf so

226
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,259
let's say we've got our dry bulb

227
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,419
thermometer and we've got our wet bulb

228
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:22,189
thermometer we go outside on a hot humid

229
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:25,069
day in Atlanta we measure 95 degrees

230
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,860
Fahrenheit dry ball and we measure 78

231
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,210
degrees Fahrenheit wet bulb so take a

232
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:34,909
moment to look at your second bunch of

233
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:38,480
charts and let's play plot the point so

234
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:45,069
on the x-axis down here you're gonna

235
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:46,940
find 95 degrees Fahrenheit between 99

236
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,980
then you're gonna look at the wet bulb

237
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,680
lines and you're gonna take the 95

238
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,680
degree fahrenheit line all the way up

239
00:10:51,679 --> 00:11:00,709
until it crosses through the 78 degrees

240
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:03,709
Fahrenheit wet Bob line and you should

241
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:08,360
put with your pen a little dot there and

242
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:11,530
that's where we are now what else do we

243
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,529
know about this point

244
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,120
let's all tell me what is the relative

245
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,120
humidity at this point

246
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:33,679
okay so 95 degrees Fahrenheit it's 95

247
00:11:29,808 --> 00:11:37,808
degrees Fahrenheit and 78 degrees wet

248
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:37,808
ball Jessie what do you have

249
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:46,079
okay so along the x-axis on the bottom

250
00:11:42,188 --> 00:11:49,238
of this chart ya go to 95 degrees dorita

251
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,678
now look at the green lines which are

252
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:53,079
the wet bulb temperature that run in

253
00:11:50,678 --> 00:12:01,328
this direction okay now find the one

254
00:11:53,078 --> 00:12:05,668
that's at 78 so 75 76 77 78 okay now run

255
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:10,048
over until those two points me 95 and 78

256
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:10,048
and put a circle there put a dot

257
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,340
perfect

258
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,309
so tell me Jesse what relative humidity

259
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,310
are we at

260
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,539
so the way to find this out is by

261
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:47,688
starting at the bottom and saying this

262
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:53,558
is zero percent relative humidity ten is

263
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:53,558
the next line up twenty thirty forty

264
00:12:53,589 --> 00:13:00,379
fifty where are we

265
00:12:57,558 --> 00:13:01,999
just below fifty we're out about 48

266
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:08,480
percent notes if you look good okay

267
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:10,610
great Brian you got it on it

268
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,350
Brian without looking at that board

269
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:18,339
don't look down I have what is the dew

270
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,339
point at this condition

271
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:28,009
remembering the dew point is along the

272
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:30,550
right side of your chart it's what are

273
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:38,539
the axes that goes straight up and down

274
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:40,479
the right side of your chart 72 who

275
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:43,069
agrees with that

276
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,879
that's all do you agree with that no

277
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:54,350
what do you say but song okay Jessie

278
00:13:46,879 --> 00:14:00,189
what do you say okay we have a consensus

279
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:04,490
formed 72 72 that's right

280
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:07,000
perfect there we go ladies and gentlemen

281
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:11,330
we found it

282
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,519
so to reiterate it's 72 degrees if we

283
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:21,440
take the same condition here and drop it

284
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:24,819
to 72 degrees that's correct if we took

285
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:29,240
any surface also that's below 72 degrees

286
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:31,670
into 95 degree air at 48 percent

287
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,710
relative humidity water is going to

288
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:37,879
condense on anything 72 degrees in below

289
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:39,950
right as the air hits that surface the

290
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,840
air gets closer and closer to the

291
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,970
temperature of the thing that is 72

292
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:49,250
degrees or less and that is where

293
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:50,710
moisture so at night where the

294
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,259
temperature drops

295
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:57,320
what happens most often when we find do

296
00:14:54,259 --> 00:15:00,100
on our cars is that the radiative effect

297
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,170
of losing all the energy out into space

298
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,570
cools the surfaces on the ground

299
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:09,889
including your metallic surfaces under

300
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:13,340
car so they do on your car is because

301
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:15,730
the surface of the car got below the dew

302
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:21,839
point of the air

303
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:21,839
make sense okay

304
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:28,059
okay so

305
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:29,980
where did this chart come from right

306
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:31,329
like who's like okay we get a chart that

307
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,230
looks like this because this will be

308
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:39,370
easy to work with all right what are the

309
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,740
places you can start is not at air with

310
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:44,080
zero water in it

311
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,480
water is molecules and getting rid of

312
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,970
molecules is actually a challenge but

313
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,899
what we can do is make saturated air

314
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:54,580
very easily I can spray moisture into

315
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,039
the air and come up with a saturated

316
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,370
condition and almost any temperature I

317
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:02,919
spray water inside of a box and I slowly

318
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,909
heat the box up until it gets to

319
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:06,939
whatever temperature I want to measure

320
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:09,250
it at and then I can take a look at the

321
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,680
amount of water inside that box and say

322
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:16,600
okay this box at this temperature holds

323
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:19,329
this much moisture so they did this for

324
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,970
a number of different temperatures of

325
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:24,970
air and they came up with a humidity

326
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:29,080
ratio which said for every pound of air

327
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:33,279
that I got inside this box I end up with

328
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:36,670
nineteen point four grains per pound a

329
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,039
full saturated conditions at forty

330
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:41,620
degrees at fifty-five you don't notice

331
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:46,179
as the temperatures go up it's not a

332
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:48,310
five degree increase five degree or five

333
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:50,129
grains per pound increase it starts

334
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:54,549
there it doesn't end there

335
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:57,309
so what happens we take these points and

336
00:16:54,549 --> 00:17:00,159
put them on a chart and that chart is

337
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:03,719
temperature in one direction and grains

338
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,719
per pound of moisture in the y-direction

339
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,528
they start here I say this is my

340
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,278
humidity ratio I have no moisture in the

341
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:16,619
air at this point I have 20 40 60 it's

342
00:17:14,278 --> 00:17:19,230
just an arbitrary scale of grains per

343
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:22,528
pound of moisture on the left side and

344
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:25,380
then I say this is my temperature 25

345
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:29,099
1,200 degrees Fahrenheit in the

346
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:32,640
x-direction so I want these are 100%

347
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:37,619
saturated air conditions if I plot them

348
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:42,270
they look like this so what well this is

349
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:44,189
our 100% relative humidity curve they

350
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:47,250
start with this line because that's very

351
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:50,429
easy to generate those conditions

352
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,980
experimental right if you don't know

353
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:55,080
where you are if you don't know where

354
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,849
you are on the psychometric chart when

355
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,398
you go to do an experiment and set up a

356
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:00,778
chart like this you have to go in one

357
00:17:59,398 --> 00:18:02,668
direction of the other you can take all

358
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:05,278
the water out you can put all the water

359
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:07,049
you know you can't get by constantly

360
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:08,278
misting the air that's what they did

361
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:13,500
here and that's how they discovered this

362
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:15,569
whatever percent humidity from there

363
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,720
it's pretty easy from there to take the

364
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:21,928
distance from here to here at any one

365
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,169
point from the curve to zero along this

366
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:28,559
line and I divide it into tenths and

367
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:32,520
this is where I get my relative humidity

368
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:35,250
curves so my relative humidity curves on

369
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,200
this chart if I go in it looks like

370
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,298
they're all very curved but if I go in a

371
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,169
straight line down there's an equal

372
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:47,028
distance between each temperature line

373
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:47,028
crossing the relative humidity curves

374
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:54,029
then follow so this is where we get the

375
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:57,440
term relative humidity fur it is a

376
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:59,970
fraction of the humidity of the air

377
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,410
relative to the total amount of air a

378
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,419
total amount of moisture of the air

379
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,940
controlled when I get to a hundred

380
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,038
percent conditions I know that I can no

381
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:13,679
longer hold any more water in the air it

382
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:16,349
is saturated okay so what does it have

383
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:21,509
to do with dry bulb light bulb dewpoint

384
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:24,990
relative humidity we can have the exact

385
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:28,589
same amount of moisture inside the air

386
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:32,179
at a number of different conditions what

387
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:35,339
changes when we go to map these points

388
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:37,710
well in this case the only absolute

389
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:40,709
measure of moisture in the air is the

390
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:45,269
dew point everything else will change as

391
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:48,419
we move along this line so at saturated

392
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:52,139
conditions let's say we're at 60 degrees

393
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:54,990
Fahrenheit right here we're at a 60

394
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,900
degree to point our wet bulb temperature

395
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:00,960
if you look at your chart is also 60

396
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,788
degrees I'm swinging around a wet sock

397
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,990
in the air hoping it'll cool off the

398
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:07,619
bulb through the evaporative cooling

399
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:09,659
effect but I have all the moisture in

400
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:12,959
the air that the air could handle

401
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:15,270
there's no water coming off the ball the

402
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,490
temperature of the air sensibly is the

403
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:21,210
temperature of the air from a latent or

404
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:24,990
moisture Laden perspective so 100%

405
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:27,329
saturation gives us the dry bulb

406
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,048
temperature the wet bulb temperature and

407
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:33,599
the dew point temperature

408
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:36,359
let's say I want to take a box of air at

409
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,259
these conditions and I'm not gonna add

410
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,788
any water to it

411
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:40,048
I'm gonna take the box it's already got

412
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:44,579
all the water it has it it's saturated

413
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:49,829
and I start to heat up the box okay and

414
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:53,009
I let it expand as I start to move away

415
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:55,678
I'm not adding water energy I'm adding

416
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:58,889
temperature energy many the heat of

417
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,809
sensible heat energy I'm gonna start

418
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:03,089
moving along this line I haven't added

419
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:07,888
any absolute more moisture into my

420
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:11,730
balloon so instead we keep the amount of

421
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:13,918
water in that volume constant we

422
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:19,048
increase the dry bulb temperature from

423
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:21,538
60 to 62 well now if I swung my wet bulb

424
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:26,730
thermometer in there it's going to be

425
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:30,990
some temperature less than less than 62

426
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:33,538
degrees right so 62 degrees is a dry

427
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,849
bulb I put it in the wet sock and now

428
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:38,158
I'm spinning it around instead of being

429
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:39,329
62 degrees it's gonna come down from 62

430
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,419
because some of that water can evaporate

431
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:46,199
off the sock the bulb gets cooler and

432
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:49,320
now we're at sixty point eight but the

433
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,600
dew point still 60 but where are we

434
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,069
other boats if humidity curve we're no

435
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,689
longer in saturation conditions we're at

436
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:56,689
92% relative okay

437
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,770
we're moving along the line we heat up

438
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:04,859
the air even more we hit 275 degrees

439
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:08,259
Fahrenheit dry bowl

440
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:10,298
75 degrees Fahrenheit dry ball equates

441
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:12,460
to sixty five point two on the wet-bulb

442
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:14,440
scale but we're still at 60 degrees on

443
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,590
the dew point the dew point hasn't

444
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,740
changed we have no more or less moisture

445
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:23,349
going into our volume of air all we've

446
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,200
done is heat it with sensible energy so

447
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:28,419
now the temperature goes up we go to 75

448
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,940
degrees the wet bulb has changed because

449
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,048
now if I slung the butt sock inside of

450
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,990
it it would cool a bulb off

451
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:37,629
significantly from 75 degrees a relative

452
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:41,769
humidity line where only 60% of the way

453
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:43,330
over this water that's sorry this is

454
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:45,429
this volume of air at this condition

455
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:48,449
could hold a lot more water now that

456
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:51,250
we've added temperature energy to them

457
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:53,440
and then finally our last point we get

458
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,740
to 90 degrees Fahrenheit the wet bulb is

459
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,679
70 and dew point 60 and run through a

460
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:02,220
relative humidity perspective really 37%

461
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,440
of the way of this theoretical line

462
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:09,240
until we hit the saturation if this line

463
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,240
continual go pretty far

464
00:23:11,538 --> 00:23:21,710
quite quite so let's talk about what

465
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:24,679
happens when we had since we we started

466
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:27,829
a condition that saturation we're adding

467
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:30,229
sensible only heat which is temperature

468
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:31,638
only temperature based heat it has

469
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:35,720
nothing to do with moisture addition

470
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:37,819
into the space this is in a grow room

471
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,069
what happens when we turn the lights on

472
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:42,739
and there are no plants in the room no

473
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:44,928
people in the room it is a dry box with

474
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:51,169
hot electric toasters that make it light

475
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:52,580
this is sensible addition of heat these

476
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:55,759
relative humidity curves like I said

477
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:58,699
before they indicate as we go up in a

478
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:01,460
very exponential way how much water the

479
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,649
air could hold at saturation and any

480
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:08,389
place on here how much more water could

481
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:11,178
hold if we wanted to get the properties

482
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:13,969
of air such that this humidity ratio

483
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:17,570
here also could be referred to as the

484
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,940
dew point matches a dry bulb and matches

485
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:21,888
the relative humidity we can use any one

486
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,320
of these points to find a way around

487
00:24:21,888 --> 00:24:25,969
this term earlier today we talked about

488
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,528
well I don't really have the conditions

489
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,229
for the room all I have is dry bulb and

490
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:32,839
wet bulb we have a number of different

491
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:34,970
ways to play on this chart to figure out

492
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:36,168
exactly which way we can go it's

493
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,929
actually exactly where we'll find

494
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:42,799
ourselves on the chart so people need to

495
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:45,470
understand that humidity ratios dew

496
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,868
points relative humidities wet bulbs and

497
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,879
dry bulb temperatures really need two

498
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:52,848
out of the seven or eight different ways

499
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:55,608
that we measure errors properties to

500
00:24:52,848 --> 00:24:59,868
find our way onto the chart moving on

501
00:24:55,608 --> 00:25:01,848
okay we've talked about travel we've

502
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:04,999
talked about with we've talked about

503
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:07,509
dewpoint absolute humidity numbers

504
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:10,000
relative

505
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:14,589
right wet bulbs dry bulbs dew points

506
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,160
also humidity ratio okay these are the

507
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:20,259
properties of air there's one more when

508
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:26,519
you talk about which is as you heat air

509
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:31,779
up it occupies more cubic feet per pound

510
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:33,779
so if I took air and I'm moving air

511
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:38,470
through a fan at a certain temperature

512
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:41,230
and then I cool that air down and I want

513
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:45,610
to move the exact same volume of air

514
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:48,490
through a fan I'm going to be moving

515
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:51,549
heavier air relatives respected to the

516
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:55,150
volume if I change the temperature in

517
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:56,409
one direction so keep that in mind the

518
00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:02,560
other thing you'll find on these lines

519
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:05,050
are specific volume cubic feet of air

520
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:09,009
for every pound of air that you want to

521
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:13,809
move okay and this comes into play when

522
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:16,990
we start talking about the we start

523
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:20,109
talking about moving air around the fan

524
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:22,359
laws fan energy and actually we're

525
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:26,049
really talking about is how much

526
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:28,000
moisture we can fit into air at higher

527
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:32,069
than higher temperatures you'll notice

528
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:36,220
that as we move along this line here the

529
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:39,189
cubic feet increases that expansion

530
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:42,069
means there is more room in a pound of

531
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,830
there that needs to get taken up as the

532
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:47,559
molecules push each other apart all that

533
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:48,970
extra energy allows for more water to

534
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:51,250
get into that air and that's why the

535
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,239
holding capacity of the air is much

536
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:57,538
higher

537
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:59,249
which respect amongst you okay so all

538
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:00,720
has to do with it everything else I

539
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:02,788
don't think there's a many other lines

540
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,739
we want to look at except for some oil

541
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:07,618
cooling lines but let's talk about

542
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:08,999
adding energy and taking energy away we

543
00:27:07,618 --> 00:27:10,798
talked about adding the sensible energy

544
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:14,389
right we're gonna go in the right

545
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:18,479
direction sensible energy is dry energy

546
00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:20,908
temperature based energy is not moisture

547
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:23,249
energy so we call it sensible heat I'm

548
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:26,129
going to go from left to right when we

549
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:28,379
add it to a volume of there so the air

550
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:30,449
of this room if there were no people in

551
00:27:28,378 --> 00:27:31,079
it there was no moisture emitting

552
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,690
sources

553
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:38,128
it would just be lights in the grow room

554
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:39,659
without plans for people okay if we want

555
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:43,199
to take that away we go the opposite

556
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:46,950
direction I'm gonna cool the air down in

557
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,960
a sensible only manner I'm not taking

558
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,340
any moisture away I don't go in this

559
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,798
direction I'll go in this direction I

560
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:55,168
don't change the humidity ratio I don't

561
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:59,759
change the to point I'm just changing

562
00:27:55,169 --> 00:28:02,580
where I am with respect to trouble I can

563
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,348
add moisture dragged into a space now

564
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:07,288
this actually a lot harder than you

565
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:09,839
might think it is to go from the air in

566
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:14,569
this room temperature and humidity to a

567
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:17,608
level straight up on this chart towards

568
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:19,829
the intersection of the dry ball and the

569
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:21,749
dew point in the window actually quite

570
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:24,989
hard to do that because as I had voiced

571
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:27,979
her into the air what happens he gets

572
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:27,979
colder why

573
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:31,178
because

574
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:40,339
what happened we suspect what happens

575
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,829
was that a pretty grueling so does that

576
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:46,659
mean by adding moisture to the air okay

577
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:46,659
so that admission in the air so what

578
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:55,579
there's some physical property there

579
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,830
it's exactly right I mean there's no

580
00:28:55,579 --> 00:29:00,500
really better answer than that a droplet

581
00:28:57,829 --> 00:29:02,929
of air as it evaporates is absorbing

582
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,539
temperature sensible energy from the

583
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:08,029
space and those water molecules shed off

584
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:10,339
of that droplet until it is all water

585
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:13,970
molecules in the air we call it dry air

586
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:15,829
okay so that energy absorption releases

587
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,539
the water molecules and now although all

588
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:20,569
the molecules at a very homogeneous way

589
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:23,210
have the same amount of energy that

590
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:24,970
energy temperature wise is lower even

591
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,100
though the moisture content has gone up

592
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:30,680
but if I want to go from here to here I

593
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:34,129
can do a couple of things I can heat up

594
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,320
the water as I am shooting it into the

595
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,750
air these are what this is what steaming

596
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,599
minifiers do for the most part if they

597
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:44,000
did it perfectly they would add no more

598
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,719
heat than was required to take those

599
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,869
molecules and turn them water into vapor

600
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,819
we always end up with some amount of

601
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:54,289
some huge amount of humidification and a

602
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:56,480
small amount of temperature increase

603
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:58,309
when we talk about steam generating

604
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,009
human fires I'm talking about taking

605
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:03,169
kettle elements putting them in a box

606
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:05,420
heating up the water to boiling and

607
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:07,670
shooting that steam into a room and

608
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,230
that's the effector than have very

609
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:13,220
little temperature increase but a very

610
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,180
high humidity okay if I want to take

611
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,319
moisture away

612
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:21,740
well in general I have to go down in

613
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:24,740
this direction to go from here to here

614
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,359
in a straight line also not one of those

615
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,390
things that's really physically possible

616
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:30,979
there's no media on earth far as I know

617
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,900
and there's definitely none available

618
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,400
commercially for the work that we do in

619
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,530
greenhouses and

620
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,060
grow that we'll take a room at this

621
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:40,279
condition and just pull moisture

622
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:42,049
straight out of it without affecting the

623
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:45,279
temperature of the air as it's doing it

624
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:48,109
we may end up taking this air and

625
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,299
cooling it or putting it through a

626
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:53,299
desiccant or putting it through any

627
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:54,769
which way we can be may end up here at

628
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:57,379
the end of the day which is what we do

629
00:30:54,769 --> 00:31:00,460
in a lot of our applications but there's

630
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:04,160
no way to go straight from there there

631
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:07,220
but the net effect is if I take a point

632
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,370
on this chart I apply some processes to

633
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:14,110
it from where I begin to where I end

634
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:16,609
these arrows are our cardinal directions

635
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:19,879
as to what that process ended up doing

636
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:22,039
if I start here and I end up here i

637
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,390
humidified even if I went this way in

638
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,210
this way or this way in this way this

639
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:28,970
doesn't matter if I start here and up

640
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:30,829
here I dehumidifier and I start here and

641
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:34,309
they end up here like we do in so many

642
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:37,069
of our roadmap occasions we have heated

643
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:40,129
and dehumidifier

644
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:47,960
but to get from here to here you'll find

645
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:49,490
out we went all the way here so you can

646
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,529
go in any which direction any

647
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,750
combination of directions following

648
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:55,369
these lines cooling and dehumidifying is

649
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,230
the one that typically most mechanically

650
00:31:55,369 --> 00:32:01,009
air-conditioning systems to not

651
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:02,569
including distance systems so what

652
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:03,910
happens we remove sensible heat we see

653
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:07,279
that the temperature goes down well

654
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:09,170
let's say that we're cooling the air by

655
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,730
introducing it to a surface that's

656
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:18,170
colder than the dew point well we're

657
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:20,839
going to end up cooling the air in a way

658
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,910
that cools it below the temperature at

659
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:24,889
which condensation will form the

660
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,990
condensation forms on that surface that

661
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:29,180
we're cooling it with and then we end up

662
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,470
doing some sensible and then latent

663
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,880
cooling as well we're not going in this

664
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:36,500
direction what does that look like in an

665
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,190
actual space why do we need to do that

666
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:42,319
with an air conditioning system well

667
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,970
let's talk about a grow room we're gonna

668
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:47,450
take air from an air conditioning system

669
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:50,029
and put it into a grow the supplier

670
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,009
comes from an air conditioning unit it

671
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:55,369
falls into the room and spins around and

672
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:58,039
it's mixed inside the room that air is

673
00:32:55,369 --> 00:33:01,549
going to pick up the sensible heat from

674
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:03,649
for example the lights the motors the

675
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:06,559
fans spinning inside the room to mix the

676
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:09,620
air around this is all dry sensible

677
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,919
energy introduction to that air but it's

678
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:15,439
also gonna pick up late again this is

679
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:18,800
not the same type of dry temperature

680
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,600
it's moisture that moisture comes from

681
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,359
the plants the plants are transpiring

682
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,759
constant

683
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,740
now there's an equilibrium you're going

684
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,420
to get if you want to make sure that the

685
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,559
room temperature stays the same and

686
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:32,550
we'll talk about how we get there later

687
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,950
but basically supplier in well pick up

688
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:36,659
sensible heat and latent heat and be

689
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:41,720
returned back to the air-conditioner so

690
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:48,779
we can do something to it all right so

691
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:51,000
if we can't match the amount of sensible

692
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:53,399
heat and latent heat added to the air as

693
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,829
it passes through a room we're going to

694
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:00,000
end up unable to control our room

695
00:33:55,829 --> 00:34:02,929
conditions so we need to quote be able

696
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,240
to remove both sensible and latent heat

697
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:07,500
to ensure that we don't stray away from

698
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,309
that condition that's going to provide

699
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,469
the planet's maximum vitality so how do

700
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:16,049
we do that a couple ways to think about

701
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:19,230
it the way that we were taught was you

702
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:23,760
have a bucket I'm heating up that bucket

703
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:25,440
and I need to balance the water I'm

704
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,070
putting into that bucket to maintain a

705
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,050
certain temperature as I remove some of

706
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:34,559
that hot water as it all mixes inside

707
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:36,690
that bucket what is the fraction of cool

708
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,130
fresh water I need to bring in to keep

709
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:41,639
the temperature up a bucket exactly

710
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:43,079
where I wanted so I've got a bucket a

711
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,299
certain temperature I light a fire

712
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:47,069
underneath it it's getting too hot okay

713
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,800
I'm going to add some more cool water

714
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,559
I'm going to balance the flow of cool

715
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,170
water and the temperature of that water

716
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:58,579
so I can maintain the temperature of the

717
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:58,579
bucket at one okay

718
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:07,129
the way that engineers use to talk about

719
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:10,150
the balance of both sensible energy

720
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:13,070
removal and latent energy removal is

721
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,750
called the sensible heat ratio is by

722
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,440
picking apart the total amount of energy

723
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:22,159
we take out of the air in both forms and

724
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,320
saying what fraction of that is done on

725
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:28,069
the temperature side versus the latent

726
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:31,010
side so I put air into a room and it

727
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:34,340
goes up ten degrees Fahrenheit on my dry

728
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:37,850
bulb and it goes up fifteen grades per

729
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:40,220
pound on my sensible heat ratio I'm

730
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:43,400
going to put those numbers into a common

731
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:46,219
unit I'm gonna take that common unit add

732
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,650
it together and knowing what I know from

733
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:49,909
the temperature in to the room the

734
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,190
temperature leaving the room of that

735
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:55,868
error I'm gonna take that sensible heat

736
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:59,179
gain and divided by the total heat gain

737
00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:00,769
going through that space now these

738
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:03,139
numbers here this since well he came and

739
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:06,320
the latent heat gain are dictated by

740
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:09,139
equations called the sensible and latent

741
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,519
heat equations we're not gonna go over

742
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:14,329
those right now the fact of the matter

743
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:17,030
is there is a way that we can take both

744
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:19,579
types of energy addition and make them

745
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:22,640
into the same common unit and in doing

746
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:24,590
so we can come up with a ratio of how

747
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,858
much of the energy we have to remove is

748
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:30,108
sensible and how much is latent so let's

749
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:32,389
talk about that you're going to look at

750
00:36:30,108 --> 00:36:35,989
your chart and you're gonna notice that

751
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:40,000
there is this sensible heat ratio around

752
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:40,000
the outside around the outside

753
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:47,210
it is all referenced to an index point

754
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:49,969
that index point you'll find a little

755
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,980
dot in the middle here where's that dot

756
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:57,799
J see give me that temperature and the

757
00:36:51,980 --> 00:37:01,059
wet ball with that dot the dry bulb and

758
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,060
wet ball temperatures of that dog

759
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,489
mmm-hmm where we looking and we looking

760
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:28,480
at the wet-bulb chart right here in the

761
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:34,319
green take this dot and follow the green

762
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,320
line all the way over to the web oh yeah

763
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:41,699
you know how we got there all right I

764
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:46,960
what's the relative humidity there Brian

765
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:50,169
it's 50/50

766
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,929
all right let me see make sure 1 2 3 4

767
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:58,869
50 Jesse's at 50 percent relative

768
00:37:52,929 --> 00:38:03,849
humidity yes yeah Mike we got it

769
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:06,219
okay if I take a volume of air and do

770
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:09,159
something to it and they end up from

771
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:12,699
going from this point to some other

772
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:17,139
point here the angle between those two

773
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:20,679
points can be lined up with an angle

774
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:23,230
between our index point and a sensible

775
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:28,119
heat ratio that's why we have this chart

776
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:31,000
I don't need to know necessarily what

777
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,730
the ratio is going into the thing I can

778
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,519
look at a process and saying hey we

779
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:39,360
start here we end up here well what

780
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:43,449
percentage of the energy being added is

781
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,849
sensibly paced and what it is

782
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:49,389
lately based how much is sensible on how

783
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:51,039
much is labeled I can use this chart by

784
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:53,440
taking the two points and the angle

785
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:57,550
between them and then corresponding them

786
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:01,000
to group this index point and the angle

787
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:04,180
informs with this indices on the outside

788
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,500
and that will tell me how much sensible

789
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:08,489
energy is added or taken away

790
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,489
how much late energies

791
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:21,940
the sequester they weren't interesting

792
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:24,389
things here okay if I have if I have all

793
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,389
right so

794
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:37,309
if I have some amount of temperature

795
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:40,369
being taken away that is a hundred

796
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:43,820
percent sensible and certainly what is

797
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:46,640
my sensible heat ratio okay so I'm gonna

798
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,050
start at this point right here and I'm

799
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,109
going to go in a sensible driving to

800
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:54,760
take away a sensible energy I'm gonna go

801
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:59,200
directly in the leftward direction okay

802
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,710
what angle am i making with innocence

803
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,859
that's why

804
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:10,030
and then I correlate that to my sensible

805
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:10,030
heat ratio number here it's a 1

806
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,670
okay

807
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,769
you're gonna hear the sensible heat

808
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,869
ratio term get thrown around a lot and

809
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:21,789
it's not certainly used every single day

810
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:23,800
it's almost like a inside some

811
00:40:21,789 --> 00:40:25,630
relic but it's it's definitely not terms

812
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,730
that we use in the HVAC industry every

813
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:29,289
day and you're more prone to hear vapor

814
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:31,090
pressure deficit which is a much more

815
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:32,769
complex eternal than the sensible heat

816
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,480
ratio but if you really want to know

817
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:36,009
what your air conditioners are doing you

818
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,039
could take a temperature and humidity

819
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:41,350
sensor at two points and go oh this is

820
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,509
how much sensible energy is being taken

821
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:48,489
out versus how much water energy is

822
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:53,920
being taken the steeper I go the smaller

823
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:58,329
the number it gets okay so if I start

824
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:01,539
here and I go here at the end of my

825
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:04,719
process I've got a very small sensible

826
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:07,960
heat ratio why is that well it turns out

827
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:13,929
that going in this direction from here

828
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:16,030
down it corresponds to 0.15 or point -

829
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:18,339
well the sensible heat ratio that means

830
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:21,670
of the energy that's been removed going

831
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:25,119
in this direction a small fraction of it

832
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:28,590
15% or 20% of it is temperature or the

833
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:32,380
rest is humidity 80% is humidity right

834
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:35,740
it is very hard and the numbers getting

835
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:37,570
very small very quick it is very hard it

836
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:42,699
takes a lot of energy to take water over

837
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:45,700
there that's gonna take so by sensible

838
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:50,129
heat ratio so quickly anytime you get

839
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:52,539
below 0.8 or 0.75 in this direction

840
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:56,019
you've basically moved outside of

841
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:56,880
comfort cooling and the world that we

842
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:58,059
live in in commercial air conditioning

843
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,430
okay

844
00:41:58,059 --> 00:42:03,829
now we start getting into greenhouse and

845
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:06,009
all right steep curves so we're looking

846
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:10,329
for we're gonna take a lot of water away

847
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:10,330
and mostly not a lot of temperature

848
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,750
absolutely

849
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,019
so we're gonna talk about how to get

850
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:25,849
there you can you can follow this one

851
00:42:24,018 --> 00:42:29,959
there's an interesting thing about this

852
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:32,028
I know if I if I also happen to

853
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,460
calculate this many lights in the room

854
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:38,150
and this one's water coming up I can

855
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:40,789
also determine how much my sensible heat

856
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:43,420
ratio has to be for me to adequately

857
00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:46,430
keep this face at the right temperature

858
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:49,460
basically I know the ratio I can take

859
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:54,528
the point of trying to maintain and draw

860
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:57,528
a line and this rate away from it as I'm

861
00:42:54,528 --> 00:43:02,088
taking energy away from this point and

862
00:42:57,528 --> 00:43:07,579
as I do it the further I get the less of

863
00:43:02,088 --> 00:43:11,838
the air I need to process in the room to

864
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:14,510
maintain this condition okay I could

865
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:17,268
take all the air in this room and I want

866
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:18,890
to make it I wanna keep it 70 degrees

867
00:43:17,268 --> 00:43:22,459
whatever it is it here and 50 percent

868
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:24,768
relative humidity if I blast air through

869
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:27,440
this room like a tornado and I take away

870
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:32,000
just a little bit of energy with each

871
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,409
passing second I'm just gonna change the

872
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,960
temperature and the humidity of the air

873
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:39,889
a small fraction before I reintroduce it

874
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:42,318
back in I don't need I don't need to

875
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:46,879
make much temperature humidity change to

876
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:49,750
the space if all I did was put a tiny

877
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,059
tube and suck a little bit of air out

878
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:55,250
condition it and then send it back in

879
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:58,970
well I would need to make that air very

880
00:43:55,250 --> 00:44:00,199
cold and very dry to get rid of all the

881
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,778
heat and the humidity that's being

882
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:04,009
generated in this space something about

883
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:08,849
what the implications are for our

884
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:12,420
greenhouses plants love

885
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:14,338
consistent temperatures if I take small

886
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,889
tubes of highly conditioned air and drop

887
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:20,338
very cool air into the room at different

888
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:22,978
spots before the air gets a chance to

889
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:25,170
mix there will be a microclimate created

890
00:44:22,978 --> 00:44:29,548
everywhere I dropped that cold air in

891
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:31,588
and just like whoever is complaining at

892
00:44:29,548 --> 00:44:33,139
the reception desk because it's so cold

893
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:37,108
and why can't we adjust the thermostat

894
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:38,909
right if I create that drop of air cold

895
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:41,670
air dropping over the plant that plant

896
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:44,940
is gonna suffer what I'd rather do

897
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:46,200
instead is keep the air coming in as

898
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,989
close to the room temperature as

899
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:52,288
possible and this is the reason in

900
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:55,139
commercial air conditioning we do four

901
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:56,999
three five air changes per hour which is

902
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:58,858
how many times I take the air in the

903
00:44:56,998 --> 00:45:03,328
room and pass it through an air

904
00:44:58,858 --> 00:45:07,259
conditioning system in an hour in Ag so

905
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:11,039
we do this kind of cooling and delivery

906
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:16,338
of hair in commercial comfort air

907
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,339
conditioning systems we do this

908
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:23,108
we're going to move 20 to 30 times the

909
00:45:20,528 --> 00:45:24,548
air 20 or 30 times in an hour we're

910
00:45:23,108 --> 00:45:26,920
gonna change it out and replace it with

911
00:45:24,548 --> 00:45:29,199
conditioned air now I save a place it's

912
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,539
just the same air being cycled back

913
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,729
we're taking co2 late in the air rather

914
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:35,440
bringing outside air replace it it's the

915
00:45:33,728 --> 00:45:38,468
same and we're gonna take it out and

916
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,119
condition it and send it back in and the

917
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:42,068
conditions and we send it back in at

918
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:45,548
have better be close to the room

919
00:45:42,068 --> 00:45:47,108
condition so that we don't cause those

920
00:45:45,548 --> 00:45:51,788
micro climates wherever we're dropping

921
00:45:47,108 --> 00:45:55,598
the air back in space okay done totally

922
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:57,430
makes sense anyways it's you know it's

923
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,798
constant cavities like maybe think about

924
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:02,228
for a while but I could either send in

925
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:04,630
very cold air and a small amount of it

926
00:46:02,228 --> 00:46:07,239
in different spots or I can move a lot

927
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:09,759
of air and not send it back in at a

928
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:21,130
temperature that is so far from where it

929
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:22,929
started there's a number of reasons for

930
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,390
that and they have to do with compressor

931
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:28,328
dynamics and the heat of you know the

932
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:30,338
heat of compressive compression of

933
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:33,249
refrigerant gases and where you go with

934
00:46:30,338 --> 00:46:34,958
that all that excess energy that's one

935
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:37,028
of those reasons that yet definitely you

936
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:39,219
don't want the pockets of hot air

937
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:43,179
sitting around the greenhouse or inside

938
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:44,108
your bank space there's so many more

939
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:46,868
reasons than that

940
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:47,798
hot air comes out of the diamond a fire

941
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:50,079
it floats

942
00:46:47,798 --> 00:46:51,759
that hot air that's been cooled so

943
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,979
that's been heated and dehumidified is

944
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:55,989
hot and it's staying up there unless you

945
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:57,308
have another fan to blow it down so now

946
00:46:55,989 --> 00:46:58,900
instead of how you can just my team in a

947
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:01,420
fire are gonna do you in a fire I've got

948
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,818
a fan a fan has to blow it down has to

949
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,739
do it a distributed way that's where if

950
00:47:03,818 --> 00:47:07,808
you hit it hit that hot air straight

951
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:10,730
down yeah you're going to have a problem

952
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:12,680
where one plant is probably in an ideal

953
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:15,590
addition and rape aside the other plates

954
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:19,868
gone right that plate is very highly

955
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:19,869
stressed and is prone to pathogen

956
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:30,430
okay temperature although there are

957
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:35,650
types of humidity densities of air

958
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:38,019
changing as we go hot and cold we're

959
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:41,200
talking about how we how we process air

960
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:44,309
now okay how we change temperatures

961
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:50,409
cooling heating humidification

962
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:54,789
dehumidification okay if I was at any

963
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:59,469
other starting point and I knew my

964
00:47:54,789 --> 00:48:03,130
sensible and latent balance I could go

965
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:06,459
to my new starting point using the ratio

966
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:11,140
line that I drew the 60% the point six

967
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:13,750
sensible Eurasian translated and know

968
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:18,039
that I had to deliver air somewhere

969
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:21,340
along this line here to counteract the

970
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:23,679
energy balance in my room this is a

971
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:25,690
well-engineered room I know exactly what

972
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:28,179
the lights are doing where the moisture

973
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:30,429
is coming from everything else I can use

974
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:31,929
this line to tell me boy I need to

975
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:35,759
liberate our here and a little bit of it

976
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:35,759
I need to deliver air here and a lot

977
00:48:38,139 --> 00:48:43,210
here's the tricky part I don't cool air

978
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:48,130
in straight lines and follow the

979
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:52,298
sensible community ratio instead I cool

980
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:56,739
air by going through four inch to 12

981
00:48:52,298 --> 00:49:01,150
inch cooling coils the cooling coil is a

982
00:48:56,739 --> 00:49:04,900
big metal box with fins and I'm passing

983
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:07,599
through those fins a coil of chilled

984
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:10,358
water or boiling refrigerator that makes

985
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:12,160
the fins very cold my air comes through

986
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:15,429
as it's coming through let's say I was

987
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:17,649
at this point as I put air through a

988
00:49:15,429 --> 00:49:20,949
cooling coil the radiator on your car

989
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:24,099
except with cold stuff as the air passes

990
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:26,739
through the cooling coil we start to

991
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:28,960
drop temperature very quickly well we

992
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:30,999
don't drop humidity that air hasn't

993
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,940
gotten to the saturation we haven't gone

994
00:49:30,998 --> 00:49:36,129
to that wet bulb temperature as I get to

995
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:40,480
the wet bulb temperature the moisture

996
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:41,950
starts to fall out as I approach it and

997
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,838
how does it starts to fall out and get

998
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:52,088
colder and now now my sensible heat

999
00:49:46,838 --> 00:49:57,068
ratios been there but I want an air on

1000
00:49:52,088 --> 00:50:01,449
this line and I wanted in this air here

1001
00:49:57,068 --> 00:50:05,190
but I have to go all the way here to get

1002
00:50:01,449 --> 00:50:08,798
it and then heat it back up sense of me

1003
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:11,318
so I determined that I need this point

1004
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:14,199
of error and this amount of air changes

1005
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:16,778
through a room I can't get from here to

1006
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:20,018
here directly I have to cool the air

1007
00:50:16,778 --> 00:50:22,150
first and then heat it back up my

1008
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:26,018
friends this is brute-force

1009
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:27,150
dehumidification we say brute force

1010
00:50:26,018 --> 00:50:31,529
dehumidification

1011
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:34,500
I am using a source of cold which is

1012
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:37,530
very hard to generate and I'm gonna cool

1013
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:40,110
my air well past the temperature I need

1014
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:42,990
it right Aladin and you only be there

1015
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:46,710
right here under need air at 65 16

1016
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:50,219
degrees but I needed that a humidity

1017
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:53,099
ratio of 60 well to get from here which

1018
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:56,129
is 70 down to here which is 16 degrees

1019
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:58,739
Fahrenheit and 16 grains per pound I

1020
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:04,170
have to go all the way down cool that

1021
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:08,609
air down to 52 degrees and then reheat

1022
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:11,820
it all the way back up to 60 this is

1023
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:15,720
illegal if we're using new forms of

1024
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:17,220
energy to do that reading so in the

1025
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:21,299
industry what we do is we use a

1026
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:25,049
compressor to compress refrigerants the

1027
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:28,140
heat of that compression is used to

1028
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:30,269
drive the reheating effect we needed the

1029
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:33,119
compressors to run anyways because we

1030
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:35,909
had to get them to expand refrigerant

1031
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,569
gases to make the cold surface on the

1032
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:40,920
coil to dehumidified in the first place

1033
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:43,530
we're not really wasting all that much

1034
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:46,670
energy but we are using a lot of energy

1035
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:49,200
going from this point to this point

1036
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:51,480
because my compressor is responsible for

1037
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,909
going all the way down here making the

1038
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,719
air all the way this cold and then

1039
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:59,849
reheating Abeka the reheating is free as

1040
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:02,459
far as we're concerned we were gonna run

1041
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:04,230
the compressors anyways to dry them it's

1042
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,090
not like we're adding toasters in the

1043
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:08,699
Airstream or electric resistance heaters

1044
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:11,550
we're not adding natural gas burgers

1045
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:12,779
we're just using the compressor energy

1046
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:17,820
we were going to send to the environment

1047
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:18,900
anyways cool the reheat is free but the

1048
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,599
cooling is not

1049
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:24,180
and not only that the designer

1050
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:27,329
refrigerant systems means that I can

1051
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:31,108
basically only reheat to about 10

1052
00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:33,839
degrees below what my starting condition

1053
00:52:31,108 --> 00:52:36,480
was traditional reheat systems just

1054
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:38,278
don't make the air any harder but there

1055
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,798
are conditions will talk about in later

1056
00:52:38,278 --> 00:52:45,389
parts of this video series that will

1057
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:48,150
show you we need to go not just to 68

1058
00:52:45,389 --> 00:52:50,818
degrees not to 75 we have to get to 85

1059
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:52,680
maybe even 90 degrees if you want to

1060
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:56,519
keep the room at the same temperature

1061
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:58,710
the same VPD the same everything that

1062
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:01,460
we're trying to maintain so the plants

1063
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:01,460
have a consistent environment
