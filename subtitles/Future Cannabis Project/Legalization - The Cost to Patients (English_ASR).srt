1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,559
that's why we've seen the true medical

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:06,528
market in cannabis be decimated I worked

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,449
with parents that were already spending

4
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:12,660
$1,200 a month for their child who has

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:16,309
epilepsy and now it's over 3,000 or

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,140
$3,600 a month when they can find it and

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,839
it's not the same as it was before

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,189
and so we've we have lost the medical

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,960
market and that's why I got into

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,300
cannabis like cannabis saved my life I

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,490
had epilepsy for years and I haven't had

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,739
a seizure in four years now because of

13
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:36,719
cannabis and and and I forget that at

14
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,149
times like this is why you got into this

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,039
industry is to help patients and to work

16
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,230
with doctors and bringing down stigma

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,089
and that is a huge part of what we're

18
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:48,919
still fighting here stigmas going down

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,920
but at what cost
