00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:13,190
my name is Kat Donnelly and I'm the CEO

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,530
of his ensive and we are a wellness and

4
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:18,618
sustainability company and we happen to

5
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:21,169
have a beautiful plasma light in our in

6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:23,420
our toolkit but we're not a lighting

7
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:25,399
company so when you talk to us we might

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,539
sound kind of weird how we talk to you

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,028
because we're gonna encourage you to

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:30,769
grow outdoors if you can we're going to

11
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:33,710
encourage you to use mother nature to

12
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:36,350
the extent that you can so we don't some

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,939
people think that's weird but we think

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,859
that's very important my name is

15
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:43,878
sunshine Johnston of some boat grown and

16
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:46,640
I farm in red crest in Humboldt County I

17
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:49,219
have 10,000 square feet of cultivation

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,308
there i dry farm I don't use any water

19
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:54,048
I've added I've transplanted in added

20
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:55,609
water and I've also transplanted and

21
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:56,509
added no water and I don't see any

22
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:59,179
difference and I think it's actually

23
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:03,829
better not to use any water at all

24
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:06,799
I grow primarily from seed and I have I

25
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:10,159
have one clone selectional EP fruit but

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,350
generally it's all from seed and I just

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,789
do that one crop I don't do any depths

28
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:16,399
or anything like that

29
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,440
but I do have a home grown in my home

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,630
grow is what I do my research and

31
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,390
development and I tinker just a little

32
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:26,719
bit but for my production farm it's I

33
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,879
want to be as natural as possible that

34
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,579
if that means not also not adding any

35
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,069
fertilizer to the field and being very

36
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:38,390
conscious about what inputs I do have

37
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:41,149
because I believe that it is nature that

38
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:44,629
perfects what I grow and not me as a

39
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:47,300
farmer and in this way I by using these

40
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:49,789
growing methods I can capture the the

41
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:52,670
terroir which is that the landscape I

42
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,100
have old-growth redwoods that grow next

43
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,620
to my farm I'm in a farming community

44
00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:04,189
where there's other farm activities

45
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:08,658
going on and I also yeah I just I really

46
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:10,758
I really really like what nature does to

47
00:02:08,658 --> 00:02:13,219
my plants so that's why I use cover

48
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:18,079
crops and flip those cover crops and use

49
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:19,818
that as my fertilizer so thank you my

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,359
name is Jeff Lowen Fell's I've got

51
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:26,030
three books the teaming series and I

52
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:27,950
believe that that this is a great group

53
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,959
because what we talk about are the three

54
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:32,348
things that I believe we all need to

55
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:38,239
have the three legs of the stool

56
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:39,709
genetics light and soil those are the

57
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,230
three things that you got to concentrate

58
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,870
on once you get those locked down you

59
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:48,649
have the best medicine you can possibly

60
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:51,468
make my name is Cindy Rajan mutia Lu

61
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:56,139
my nickname is sin but lately it's been

62
00:02:51,468 --> 00:03:01,218
turned his son by this gentleman and I'm

63
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:02,540
a technology and Vangelis but my whole

64
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:04,579
goal is biomimicry

65
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:07,638
is if we are going to come up with

66
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:12,010
technology how do we melt it with nature

67
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:15,980
how do we emulate nature and so my

68
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:20,358
probably my most significant strategic

69
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:24,399
partner and probably the one that means

70
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:24,400
the most to me is Mother Nature

71
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:31,810
I'm Hawk Marsden I own a company called

72
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,109
you can to to educational nursery

73
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:38,719
we provide clones and strains for

74
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:42,639
basically 80% of the market that's out

75
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:45,769
there right now started in my garden

76
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,329
when growers get their first 90 days to

77
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,938
come and accumulate all their strains

78
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:51,949
for the recreational garden in most

79
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,900
cases they either came to rainbow farms

80
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:56,540
here in Portland OR they came to our

81
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,959
place out in Sheridan and got them from

82
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:01,098
there

83
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:05,569
I've been collecting genetics since 1978

84
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:07,280
and I have seeds from just about all of

85
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:12,619
the original classic strains and that's

86
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,209
what I prefer to grow you know taking we

87
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,199
do a lot of propagation we do a lot of

88
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:21,579
breeding and we take genetics that come

89
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,468
from other experienced growers that have

90
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:26,839
extreme medical benefits I'm not a

91
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:29,949
recreational grower I am a medical

92
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:34,359
grower I am a die-hard medical grower

93
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:36,329
if you if the medical program ever came

94
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,300
to an end I'd be that last guy fighting

95
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:43,120
okay because I I don't like the way I've

96
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,850
seen the industry grow I don't like the

97
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,300
way that I've seen growers take basic

98
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,870
strains that had such great medicinal

99
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:59,199
value to them and diminish them to

100
00:04:52,870 --> 00:05:02,649
nothing ineffective improper growing so

101
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,509
we bring the new guys out there those

102
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:06,039
guys who really want to learn how to

103
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:09,639
grow and they come out and they learn

104
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:13,060
our methods I'll take with one plant

105
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,219
what you do with 50 plants and most of

106
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,870
you probably grow in 3 gallon 5-gallon

107
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,710
pots if you're doing it indoor garden

108
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,480
you know and it's quick cultivation I'll

109
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:23,399
take a three and a half to a four and a

110
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,319
half month

111
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,829
vegetation period and a sixty day and

112
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,769
I'll do anybody that you produce with

113
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:35,109
one plant you heard a myth around

114
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:39,250
Portland that there's a guy who does 5.9

115
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:42,400
six pounds for one plant and I am that

116
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,500
guy I'm not saying that to brag but I

117
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,159
believe in keeping the genetics around

118
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:52,120
so if I'm using one seed in order to

119
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,310
propagate 200 plants that will be all

120
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,259
the babies that come from that and then

121
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,740
I take that plant and I put it into

122
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:59,829
flour

123
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:03,129
I've actually matured it enough for it

124
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:05,859
to totally outline its entire terpene

125
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:09,670
profile which gives you the full medical

126
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,430
benefit of the plant instead of my new

127
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:14,860
part of it whether you allow plant to

128
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:18,009
only get a foot tall or two feet tall

129
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,460
you're not giving it the ability to make

130
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:25,810
that roadmap now if you're gonna grow

131
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:28,149
outside you know then I agree every

132
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,120
natural resource that is available to

133
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:32,679
you should be utilized instead of all

134
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,449
the synthetics and things that are going

135
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,730
in because when those synthetics go into

136
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,490
your buds it diminishes the medical

137
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:43,390
quality why did you become a grower to

138
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,720
begin with probably 80% of you that are

139
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,699
City

140
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,460
in here right now started off as medical

141
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:50,829
growers if you were medical grower show

142
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:54,759
me your hand if you're still a medical

143
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:56,769
grower keep your hand up okay there's a

144
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,360
difference in your buds now compared to

145
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:01,299
what you were producing back when you

146
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,449
were medical isn't it something

147
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,009
disappeared as soon as that recreational

148
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:14,199
law came in and one thing was deleted

149
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:15,819
from 90% of the growers the heart the

150
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,240
heart went out of the plant as soon as

151
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:21,219
the heart goes out that's it then you

152
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,189
have to depend on what the plant can do

153
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,310
and how quick you can do it and how much

154
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:29,199
you can make as quick as you can

155
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,670
now we have this overabundance and we're

156
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,699
worried about whether or not we can ship

157
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:35,710
it out of state and things like that I

158
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,599
got a perfect idea to do what you know

159
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:38,979
what to do with all that abundance we

160
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,220
got a lot of patients in this state that

161
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:45,550
no longer have growers nobody cares

162
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:48,010
anymore you know I'm the guy who's gonna

163
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,020
fight for that you know to get the

164
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,918
patients taken care of and to keep the

165
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:56,560
strains prime example the black buddha i

166
00:07:52,918 --> 00:08:00,279
be prostate cancer three times in five

167
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,379
years with RSOs suppositories made from

168
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,779
the black buddha the black boot over to

169
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:06,310
landraces the Hindu Buddha that come

170
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:08,859
from the base of the Hindu mountains and

171
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,500
the black domina which is a predominant

172
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,540
land race strain of Africa in crossing

173
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,389
those two genetics we were able to

174
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,430
develop the black buddha which we then

175
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:21,909
in turn sold to green house seeds in

176
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:24,189
Amsterdam who mass-produce it so that it

177
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,860
can be turned around and sold in seed

178
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:29,050
form to everybody around the around the

179
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,229
world to be able to produce that plant

180
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,538
and the one thing is lethally does not

181
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,669
give you accurate information as to what

182
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:39,639
your strains can actually do for a

183
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:41,679
patient how much research did you do

184
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:42,819
when you were a medical grower towards

185
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,299
the strains that you were originally

186
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,640
growing and turned your back on it's

187
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:52,179
time to bring the land races back get

188
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,789
back to the classics and and begin again

189
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:57,759
build a whole new roadmap and I hope

190
00:08:54,789 --> 00:09:01,240
that it through his electronics

191
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:04,778
and my growing techniques and genetics

192
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,930
and this guy's soil to be able to turn

193
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:11,110
around and take you back to 1960 when

194
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:14,739
the idea of what cannabis could really

195
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,329
inspire medically started coming forward

196
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,610
it wasn't just about the hippies getting

197
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:20,919
stoned I'm not old enough to remember

198
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,980
too many of the hippies I'm in my 50s

199
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:28,000
you know but I do remember in the 70s

200
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:31,209
and in the early 80s watching all the

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,850
teenagers around me smoking and the

202
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:36,458
difference that I saw then was there was

203
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,920
a love of the plant and when I came to

204
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:40,719
Oregon I came here I didn't come here to

205
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:42,909
be a grower I didn't even come here to

206
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,930
use cannabis I came here because Oregon

207
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:49,088
was an assisted suicide State I had two

208
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:53,259
weeks left to live and I came here to

209
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:56,019
die a guy came into my hospital room it

210
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,220
gave me a cookie and then it came back

211
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:01,179
the next day and he gave me another

212
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:06,430
cookie that man changed my life changed

213
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:08,019
my opinion I burned pot fields my first

214
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:08,620
two years in the United States Marine

215
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:11,318
Corps

216
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,360
I burned pot fields in Colombia that was

217
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:15,370
my job to stand there with a

218
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,629
flamethrower and burn pot but I wasn't

219
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,549
allowed to burn the coca plants on the

220
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:24,278
other side of the road I mean I'm not

221
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,019
joking you know it was that that was my

222
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:27,578
job and and you know what I didn't have

223
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:30,789
a problem with doing that because what I

224
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:32,620
saw in nineteen in the 70s going through

225
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:35,198
high school and everything everybody who

226
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,970
was smoking pot was quitting school you

227
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:38,229
know they weren't finishing school you

228
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,730
know they were all hanging out in the

229
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,319
park and things like that but nothing

230
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,879
never dawned on me to the fact that it

231
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:46,028
it wasn't that they quit school because

232
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,578
of the pot they quit school because of

233
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:50,379
the school they quit school because of

234
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:55,689
the teaching or B they quit school

235
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:57,309
because you know okay okay I can go for

236
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,970
hours

237
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:03,159
but but it's but the idea is the

238
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,250
landraces

239
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:08,839
the the original footprints that's the

240
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,330
only way we can get back to where we

241
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,600
were and that's where you guys as

242
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:18,940
growers once again find your love of the

243
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,940
plant instead of the love of the Prophet

244
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:31,220
so I wish we had five hours because

245
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:34,700
every one of these people on the panel

246
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,200
have a lot of very very very important

247
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,379
things to say so please look them up

248
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,420
after if you don't get all your answers

249
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:42,950
I guess we will never get all our

250
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:45,769
answers but if we don't get all the

251
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,240
questions answered today so I just want

252
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:51,319
to throw out a question to the audience

253
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:54,220
does anyone know what biomimicry is back

254
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,220
here you raised your hand first

255
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:04,039
exactly so the definition of biomimicry

256
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:07,159
it's a noun and it is the imitation of

257
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:11,299
natural biological designs or processes

258
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:13,219
in engineering or invention and for us

259
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:14,750
for us as a company that's very very

260
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,509
important there's examples everywhere

261
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,090
there's wind turbines that are based on

262
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:24,710
the humpback whales they're they're

263
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:26,840
design there's self cooling buildings

264
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,650
based on the architecture of termite

265
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,080
mounds

266
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:32,990
there's bullet trains based on the

267
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,660
aerodynamics of the Kingfisher lots and

268
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,100
lots and lots of examples and we think

269
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:39,469
this is very important they're

270
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,570
everywhere and so that those are you

271
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,029
that are growing and living soil outdoor

272
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,550
in the Sun using regenerative methods

273
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:48,169
you already doing this because we know

274
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:49,969
we all know in this room you probably

275
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:53,539
wouldn't be here today if you didn't

276
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:56,690
know that mother nature is the smartest

277
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:59,449
engineer on this planet she knows what

278
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,030
to do she hasn't figured out why are we

279
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:04,040
trying to dial it in so that's that's

280
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:06,199
kind of the point of today as mother

281
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,809
nature's figured it out so we're going

282
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,360
to get to one question from each panel

283
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:12,708
member

284
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,690
and I might cut them off just in case

285
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:17,099
just to let you guys know I'm just so he

286
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,510
can keep things moving because we do

287
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,459
want to be sure to open it up to the

288
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:27,028
audience so what we'll start with

289
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:29,069
sunshine sunshine we we know that land

290
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:32,009
races are tied to their native bio

291
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,050
regions and you know not everyone is

292
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:36,539
lucky as you to grow right there where

293
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:38,609
the redwoods are kissing your farm can

294
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,409
you talk a little bit about the Sun and

295
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,300
the intelligence of lights and the

296
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:44,610
connection to the cosmos we talked a

297
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:47,759
little bit and what excites you about

298
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:53,690
having the indoor Sun in your world

299
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:57,990
I was actually been super hesitant about

300
00:13:53,690 --> 00:14:00,029
indoor lighting and but I do want to

301
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,889
take cuttings on my seed plants and I do

302
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:03,929
want to preserve my genetics so there

303
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:05,850
was always this feeling of okay now if I

304
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:07,620
can do some kind of a hybrid if I can

305
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:11,370
get the natural Sun in there and I

306
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,589
overwinter and I've done a number of

307
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:17,129
years in my home grove doing just that

308
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:19,769
where I produce a food crop essentially

309
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:21,480
I love having fresh buds six months out

310
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:24,360
of the year I use it in all my cuisine I

311
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,940
do infused honey infused oils I juice

312
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,100
raw bud and I value it for that in my

313
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,220
home grow and at the same time for my

314
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,649
genetic so I have been wondering what to

315
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,050
do about this because when I it's true

316
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:38,909
when I see plants growing under

317
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:41,278
artificial lights my first thought is

318
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:42,719
those plants are being grown in prison

319
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,220
it's just something about it it just

320
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,250
doesn't feel right to me and with that

321
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,320
it also has to do with the quality of

322
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:55,289
the light because when you have sunlight

323
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,329
which travels eight minutes across the

324
00:14:55,289 --> 00:15:00,240
sky you're getting a more coherent light

325
00:14:57,328 --> 00:15:01,739
that that path is following I forget

326
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,060
what the distance is from the Sun to the

327
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,778
earth but I know it takes a little over

328
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:08,669
eight minutes whereas when you're using

329
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:11,399
electric light bulbs that light can be

330
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:13,889
incoherent it's it's very it's it's a

331
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,750
different kind of light and light is

332
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:19,980
intelligence light is the hot it's the

333
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:21,328
most form it's the it's mostly it's the

334
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,119
biggest form of chemi

335
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:28,649
vacation used on the planet all the

336
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:31,230
little all the little uns microbes

337
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:33,149
things anyway in the ocean light but

338
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,970
light is important and and there is an

339
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:40,889
intelligence behind the light so I have

340
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:44,970
been wondering about what can I do for

341
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:48,808
my genetics to keep them as close as as

342
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:53,459
close as possible to their truth I guess

343
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:54,988
if you want to call it that and I I was

344
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:59,698
wondering okay what am I gonna do about

345
00:15:54,989 --> 00:16:01,379
this well I was I finally lit up my room

346
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:03,058
with the Sun on demand and it definitely

347
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,920
made a difference I was like okay I

348
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:07,259
think I haven't answered to my nursery I

349
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:11,428
think I have a future in this and I can

350
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:13,499
do this and I've been using it for just

351
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:16,948
a few months really not not that long

352
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:19,230
and I've been impressed with the health

353
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:23,849
of the plants and the way it responds

354
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:28,619
it's no substitute for for the Sun but

355
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:33,079
it it helps me with overwintering and

356
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:35,850
maintaining my my genetics and also

357
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:38,818
sunlight is important to you because if

358
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:41,819
you look at say the way how it relates

359
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:44,128
to to your toe arch to your native place

360
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:48,238
and and and where you're at for instance

361
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:49,918
here in Oregon you grow amazing amazing

362
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:51,959
wine and the quality of those wine has

363
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:53,999
everything to do with the quality of the

364
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:57,298
Sun and the way the angle that it hits

365
00:16:53,999 --> 00:17:00,298
the the part partly cloudy skies the

366
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:02,578
refraction of the Sun from those from

367
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:05,939
those clouds and the way how you anyway

368
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:07,798
it's a it's a beautiful thing here in

369
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:11,130
Oregon a lotta it has to do do with your

370
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:18,388
latitude and and where where you're at

371
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:19,860
so yeah it indoor light as well the

372
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:21,328
other interest that I have in indoor

373
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,908
light is looking at the different

374
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:27,568
frequencies and how can you use light

375
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:30,419
frequency for for healing and for

376
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:32,538
medicine for your plants and also for

377
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,538
yourself

378
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,750
well you know I'm old enough to remember

379
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:40,819
when people started growing indoors and

380
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,230
it was exciting for cannabis let's start

381
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:44,839
there I mean I remember when people were

382
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,599
starting to grow indoors anything and we

383
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,949
had these terrible purple lights and you

384
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,808
could drive around a neighborhood and

385
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,400
you knew who was growing plants indoors

386
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:54,829
and who wasn't growing plants indoors

387
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,538
and everybody had the same color light

388
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:57,980
it was only one kind of light that you

389
00:17:56,538 --> 00:17:59,538
could buy for growing plants and then

390
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,880
somebody discovered the difference

391
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:03,890
between you know the the cool white

392
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,480
fluorescent bulbs and the warm white

393
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,850
flesh and bulbs cetera Center in Center

394
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,150
but all of us learned how to grow

395
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:13,490
outdoors you learned with your parents

396
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,200
or your grandparents outdoors and then

397
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,929
we all started to get into the cannabis

398
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,179
world and the whole cannabis world when

399
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,610
I was a kid was designed to be

400
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:25,880
clandestine and secretive and indoors

401
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:28,428
and quiet and so you had to go to lights

402
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,740
and so we use whatever lights we had and

403
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:32,390
of course the minute you go indoors and

404
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,569
you go away from the sunlight you're

405
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,730
you've got a different plant blablabla

406
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:40,089
and and you breed the plant differently

407
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,529
and so it's so - it's not just the light

408
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:44,178
team you need shorter plants and so

409
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:46,099
let's go to Afghanistan let's get some

410
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:47,720
Afghani and mix it in with these taller

411
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:49,519
plants so let's make some smaller plant

412
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,440
and all of a sudden we end up with a

413
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,200
plant that is designed to be grown

414
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,700
indoors because that's the only place

415
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,769
you can grow it and that's the only

416
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,029
reason why you look at the genetics of

417
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,279
that plant we want to be able to grow

418
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:03,639
something indoors you know as

419
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,740
successfully as possible when in fact

420
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,990
the real place to be growing is outdoors

421
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,500
under the Sun with real soil and real

422
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,769
microbes and all natural conditions and

423
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,599
so we're stuck and then we add in the

424
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:19,700
alcohol at the miracle-gro Hydra general

425
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,709
hydroponics syndrome you know where

426
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,710
they've got a product they want to make

427
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:29,659
you use it they convince you to use it

428
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:31,220
they show you spectrums that are you

429
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:34,940
know but they convince you that they're

430
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:38,089
the best you know and then you run into

431
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,490
a Sun on demand type situation and all

432
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:42,709
of a sudden you go wait a second I can

433
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,319
be indoors and have ever

434
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,600
than I needed outdoors because I got a I

435
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:49,599
got a son on demand and I can I can

436
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:53,209
pretend I'm in Durban South Africa

437
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:57,199
indoors and dial in the light like it is

438
00:19:53,210 --> 00:20:00,019
in Durban Durban South Africa in theory

439
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,960
I can get soil microbes like they are in

440
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:05,210
Durban and all of a sudden I'm growing

441
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,399
Durban poison the way they grow it in

442
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,048
South Africa Wow

443
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:11,298
now that's the way you would do it

444
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:13,009
outdoors right you'd go get the right

445
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:14,898
stuff you'd be going on the right lights

446
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:18,288
there and so you know we got to just

447
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:21,139
adjust if you're gonna grow indoors grow

448
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:23,179
outdoors indoors don't grow indoors

449
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,278
because it's easy you know because this

450
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:28,220
is how we develop the system so that the

451
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:29,898
plant will fit indoors that's not the

452
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,380
way to go and then at the end of it all

453
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:35,839
course is that the light and landrace

454
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:39,110
are you know they're like this and tear

455
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:41,389
or you know the the Durban poison that

456
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:42,740
you grow in Durban South Africa it's

457
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,470
gonna be different than the Durban

458
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,929
poison you grow in Grants Pass period

459
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:51,440
but if you can dial in the light the

460
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:53,630
right way etc etc etc and and and to go

461
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,669
back and just tie it all together this

462
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,590
idea that we adjusted our plant so that

463
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:58,909
we could grow it indoors we adjusted our

464
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:03,168
light so that we could grow them indoors

465
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:05,299
has resulted in a plant that's not what

466
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:08,778
we really want it's not the medical

467
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:11,690
cannabis that we started out thinking we

468
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:15,288
were gonna get it's a disease a Walt

469
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:18,769
Disney you know Ford Motor Company Scots

470
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:20,658
Miracle Grow design plant one size fits

471
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:22,099
all if you can change it a little bit

472
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,440
fine you can paint it different colors

473
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:25,099
but it's one plant fits all it's all got

474
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,620
afghani

475
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:30,199
you know and it's all designed to fit

476
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:32,599
indoors once we start to figure out how

477
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,190
to design the plan for medicine forget

478
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,048
about the fact that we're indoors we're

479
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,480
gonna be winning and this light lets us

480
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:41,720
do that teeming with microbes let's you

481
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:45,130
do that you know and we're there we've

482
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,130
got all the tools that we need

483
00:21:48,759 --> 00:22:00,799
it's it one so yeah a hit I I put the

484
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:06,409
light in my greenhouse and I I have a

485
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:08,629
couple of 25 by 40 hoop houses and I do

486
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:11,380
black tarp um but it's white on the

487
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:14,120
inside black on the outside and I

488
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:17,990
sectioned off three sections I put in

489
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:20,719
three LEDs in one section and put in the

490
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:24,099
same strains is what I put in under four

491
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,279
DeVita's and then I put in Sun on demand

492
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:30,409
now the first thing that I noticed is in

493
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:32,599
most indoor grows the first formation

494
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,920
that you get is the crown of the bud it

495
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:35,809
gives you a nice little rounded off

496
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,279
crown that's when all the hairs start

497
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:39,109
coming up and you know that you're in

498
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,490
the beginning of the budding cycle

499
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:43,099
correct everybody seen that before

500
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,500
okay but with the Sun on demand it came

501
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:48,169
up just like it does in the outdoor part

502
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:52,359
of our garden the bud formation began

503
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:55,850
like II where it's a very widespread in

504
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:59,359
the hairs and and and the body buildup

505
00:22:55,849 --> 00:23:01,159
of it and all the flowers that are

506
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,929
growing underneath that are growing no

507
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,880
different than when I grow them in my

508
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:09,230
field in the middle of the summer you

509
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:13,040
know and we've we just finished our our

510
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:15,559
first winter crop ever at the farm out

511
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:18,529
here because we just we had no heat we

512
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:21,559
you know it he don't even want to know

513
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:23,269
the story behind that but but we you

514
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,639
know we kept the genetics alive through

515
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:27,529
the winter and when these guys brought

516
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,180
out the Sun on demand and we put it in

517
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:33,019
there we said okay let's do a comparison

518
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,430
and it was very apparent this Wednesday

519
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:36,500
when we had a group of people come out

520
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:38,810
to the farm and you could see the same

521
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,970
three strains underneath three different

522
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:44,710
lights and what the production value was

523
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:48,650
on the Afghan inferno we probably got

524
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:52,610
more than 3/4 of a pound more in a

525
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:55,460
twenty gallon pot then but this was done

526
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:57,289
in a five-gallon okay we did this in a

527
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,240
five gallon but you would have thought

528
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:01,940
that it grew in a 20 gallon pot

529
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,700
but under the kavita's I got a plant

530
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:08,929
that was like you know like a five

531
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:13,220
gallon pot you know we got maybe a pound

532
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:15,380
in a pound in an eighth at the most off

533
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,390
of that plant and under the led

534
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,039
we got less than a pound we were closer

535
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,919
to three-quarters of a pound and the

536
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,480
quality of the bud was each one of them

537
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,538
was a little bit different the Sun on

538
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,450
demand was the most effective medically

539
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:31,398
you know and and and that's the big

540
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,220
thing is it's one of the triggers that

541
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:36,469
we use for adult seizures the one that's

542
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,259
under the LED didn't have its the

543
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,750
desired effect the ones under the Gavita

544
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:44,000
came close but they weren't there

545
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:47,630
the one under the Sun on demand no

546
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,659
seizures since that day so so so that

547
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:53,270
tells me that going in in that direction

548
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:55,039
was was the best thing for us and now

549
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:57,079
we're actually cleaning out the entire

550
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,658
hoop house and and we're gonna do Sun on

551
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:02,389
demand and in the whole thing the

552
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:05,960
footprint of this plant is or of this

553
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:08,149
light I've never seen a light that can

554
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,210
penetrate through and penetrate down

555
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:14,719
into the soil and not overheat the room

556
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:17,360
and you know causing air flow conditions

557
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,569
and everything else and you know with

558
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:24,288
proper co2 being instituted at the same

559
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:27,849
time you could have you know it your

560
00:25:24,288 --> 00:25:27,849
your growth abilities are exponential

561
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:35,308
[Applause]

562
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:37,260
so I feel a little sheepish because this

563
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:40,649
is not intended to be a commercial for

564
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:44,190
the Sun on demand maybe I'm gonna bring

565
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:46,769
it back to another topic you know we're

566
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:48,690
really really telling you the truth when

567
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:51,329
we say if you can grow outside please do

568
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,039
use the natural resources so please

569
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:55,859
don't take this as a commercial for the

570
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,139
Sun on demand we're just as a company

571
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:00,689
looking for biomimicry ways to support

572
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,009
those beautiful outdoor growths

573
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,660
so I'm going to bring it back to

574
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:06,720
something that I've been thinking about

575
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:09,120
a lot and you know we've been watching

576
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,419
this industry for a while it's very

577
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:15,000
important to us as a company and I think

578
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:19,040
to most of you in this room that the

579
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,710
small original farmers get to maintain

580
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,529
their lifestyle get to maintain their

581
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,970
plants and what they're doing so I'm

582
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:30,359
going to kick a question I think I'm

583
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:33,450
gonna start it with Jeff what do you

584
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:35,759
think is the best way we can preserve

585
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,640
the small farmer and the small grower

586
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:42,629
and stop this from being something where

587
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,509
anheuser-busch comes in or insert X big

588
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:48,650
company comes in and takes over how are

589
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:51,569
we gonna work together to preserve that

590
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:53,519
well you know my standard my standard

591
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:55,980
answer is we grow the best medical

592
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:58,109
cannabis we possibly can and we'll win

593
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,759
you know because that's not what you

594
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:02,129
know and as the bush is gonna do they're

595
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,440
gonna grow the most efficient cheapest

596
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,480
standardized stuff you know I was gonna

597
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,970
be just like the beers versus the craft

598
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,589
beers you've all heard that stuff you

599
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,419
know and obviously that's true and I and

600
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:13,649
I still stand by that answer but I you

601
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,340
know the more I think about it I think

602
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:20,340
we we have approached this whole medical

603
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:23,548
stuff and recreational stuff from the

604
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:25,409
viewpoint of trying to convince people

605
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:27,960
we thought didn't didn't want to do this

606
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,779
and so we came up with this idea that

607
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,419
you know we'll smoke and pay for your

608
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:35,428
schools you know and so we we sort of

609
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:37,500
went around in color all the states have

610
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:39,298
this thing we're gonna raise taxes this

611
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,470
is great it's gonna be terrific you

612
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:42,210
don't have to smoke weed but we're gonna

613
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,460
raise tax money by letting other people

614
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,579
smoke weed and so we ended up with this

615
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,640
situation

616
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:50,619
it's becoming untenable for dispensaries

617
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,240
for individual growers to be able to

618
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:54,189
deal with the taxing situation that

619
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,769
we've got that's been imposed upon us

620
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,360
because we wanted to legalize it and so

621
00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:00,400
we thought t-this is a clever way to do

622
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:02,319
it well you know I think we've got to

623
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,600
sit back now and figure a better way to

624
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,700
do it and and one of the things I've

625
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,629
always thought we could do and I don't

626
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,880
know how you do it

627
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:13,180
we don't use our political power the way

628
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,580
we should we have a day for 20 day you

629
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:18,789
know where we party where every single

630
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:21,129
news journalist in the country wants to

631
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:22,750
write a story half of them do they all

632
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,460
use the word marijuana you know we've

633
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:26,859
talked about this idea of usually using

634
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,110
that day to come up with you know this

635
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:30,609
is the day everybody switches and starts

636
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:31,779
using cannabis and doesn't use marijuana

637
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:33,459
anymore

638
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:35,980
you know some political something other

639
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,769
and maybe what we need to start doing is

640
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,870
say wait a second this taxing situation

641
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:43,359
has gotten out of hand this is a plant

642
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:46,149
you don't tax tomato plants you don't

643
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,229
tax marigolds you know why are we doing

644
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:50,410
this to ourselves

645
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:53,829
I'm taxing the cannabis we want it legal

646
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:55,450
we want to pay a fair share sure but you

647
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:57,519
know the tomato growers pay a little

648
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,069
teeny tax they don't have a 280

649
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,500
situation and maybe what we need to do

650
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:05,169
is figure out a way that everybody who

651
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,240
goes into a dispensary on August 1st or

652
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:10,420
whatever the data is around this country

653
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,970
sends a note from the dispensary you

654
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,830
know whoever we need to identify and

655
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,140
start applying the kinds of pressure

656
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:19,089
that we need to apply as a group we need

657
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,160
to come together to protect the

658
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:23,379
individual farmer and individual

659
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,690
dispensaries and and I think we need to

660
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:29,680
use our political power and we are not

661
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:31,809
doing that we party we don't power up

662
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:35,799
and instead of partying up we need to

663
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:38,319
power up we are the largest single group

664
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:40,269
I can think of in this country we have

665
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,649
you know we have mega people and non

666
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:43,690
mega people doesn't make a bit of

667
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,340
difference we are united behind this

668
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,500
idea that we want to be able to grow

669
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:49,269
cannabis legally and not have the

670
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,559
government screwing around with us so

671
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:52,559
that's just where I come from

672
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:56,870
and the on-court

673
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,250
the unfortunate thing is you know that

674
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:59,839
there are so many other problems like

675
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,250
the abortion problem and everything else

676
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,138
that gets in the way of all of this

677
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,119
stuff at some point in time we got to

678
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:07,668
come together and just say we can do

679
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,768
this let's do it so I don't know how we

680
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:10,970
do it but somebody needs to organize it

681
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:15,380
and put it together and I'm too old to

682
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:17,089
do it but maybe some time I will say

683
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:20,480
that having grown up in southern

684
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:21,798
Humboldt back in the day no one really

685
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,839
had any money and it was during that

686
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:26,450
time of not having money that we

687
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:29,959
actually created our own institutions we

688
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:32,120
had our own we had our own community

689
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,659
safety net safety net that we did it

690
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,369
ourselves

691
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:36,139
and how we did it is we formed a

692
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:37,579
community radio station that would tell

693
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:39,439
us when helicopters were flying

694
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:40,879
we had the material community center we

695
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,558
had a health care we still have these

696
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:49,370
and we had community schools and we also

697
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:50,720
have a Community Credit Union and over

698
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:52,788
the period of the past 10 to 15 years

699
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,470
with the Green Rush we've seen a

700
00:30:52,788 --> 00:30:56,929
corruption of money in our community

701
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:00,440
we've seen our nonprofits actually have

702
00:30:56,929 --> 00:31:03,320
a difficult time and I'm hoping now that

703
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,620
through our farms we can return that

704
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:09,740
back to our nonprofits the problem that

705
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:11,808
I face with taxation as a farmer is that

706
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,909
and I knew I knew this going into it I'm

707
00:31:11,808 --> 00:31:15,829
like you're a farmer and you are at the

708
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:18,559
bottom everyone is going to take take

709
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:20,119
take to quote an Anthony B song everyone

710
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:24,259
wants to raid the bar no one wants to

711
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:27,408
grow the corn and this is this is a very

712
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:29,569
real reality so what happens is the

713
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:31,580
taxations get kicked down to us us as

714
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:33,678
farmers we are the credit for the entire

715
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:35,960
industry and we can't get credit

716
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:39,649
everyone is borrowing from us as farmers

717
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,569
and it is very challenging so it comes

718
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,788
back to the taxation okay so the

719
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:45,950
retailer wants to take 50% oh wait it's

720
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:47,960
not quite 50 it's little more than 50 Oh

721
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:50,899
why because oh they're kicking the tax

722
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,139
down to us and this is true for all

723
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:56,148
farmers across all industries but the

724
00:31:54,138 --> 00:31:58,609
government didn't really see it that way

725
00:31:56,148 --> 00:32:00,859
there's been this concept of greed Oh

726
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:03,019
growers oh this whole concept of oh

727
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:05,229
they're making all this money and

728
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:07,430
we've had to pay a cannabis rate for

729
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,630
everything across the industry you go to

730
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:11,210
the grow shop we have to pay more for

731
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:15,980
our beneficial insects than anyone else

732
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:18,650
another do we have to well yeah that's

733
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,950
that's the that's the question isn't it

734
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:23,590
so it is a challenge with taxation in

735
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:26,420
California right now they are looking

736
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:30,470
withholding the cultivation tax till

737
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:32,480
2020 and that will that will help but

738
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:35,059
it's also important when we're thinking

739
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,360
about our companies and our farms and

740
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:40,639
our businesses that our farms can

741
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:42,409
represent a cause and that cause can

742
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,500
benefit the earth and benefit the world

743
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:47,990
and so be thinking because I was raised

744
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,180
by activists we grew and we saved

745
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,940
redwood trees we helped indigenous

746
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:55,730
people that's what we used our profit

747
00:32:52,940 --> 00:33:02,870
from from growing and that's the same

748
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:07,360
thing I'm gonna do the other thing I

749
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:14,719
want to add and Hawk is very modest and

750
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:17,449
his his the work that he's done he does

751
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:22,700
it with with a very big heart and he

752
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:25,759
gives 75 85 percent of his money out he

753
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,230
tries to work on about 20 or 10% of the

754
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,480
money that comes in the rest of it goes

755
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:33,170
to his patients the rest goes out to

756
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,720
teach people how to grow to save their

757
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:38,000
lives to save their children's lives so

758
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,920
I think it takes that kind of heart and

759
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,559
that's what he's talking about is that

760
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,509
heart has to come back not just heart

761
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,759
for yourself for your patients but heart

762
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:49,879
for that plant as well so I think when

763
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:52,279
you talk about smaller farms you have to

764
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,800
be somewhat differentiate yourself on

765
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:57,500
the marketplace you have to put your

766
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,509
heart into it and that's what's going to

767
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,700
show that's what's gonna show in the

768
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:04,129
plant it's gonna reward you for having

769
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:07,490
that heart and so I think with a small

770
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:09,619
farmer you've got to stop conforming and

771
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:13,340
be more individual with what you have

772
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:16,398
and love yourself love the plant love

773
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,720
your patient throw that love out

774
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,659
it'll come back to you in so many

775
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:24,480
different ways I think that's the plight

776
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:28,628
of the small farmer not to conform

777
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,668
[Applause]

778
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:34,009
okay so now's the time to open it up to

779
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:35,269
the audience I agree with you guys in

780
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,460
terms of what you're talking about in

781
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:39,980
terms of the small farmer opening up

782
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,588
regulation is only gonna encourage big

783
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,750
business to come in to a de as painful

784
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:47,028
as it is for us prevents major

785
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,889
pharmaceutical companies prevents major

786
00:34:47,028 --> 00:34:50,269
alcohol companies from putting money

787
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:51,619
into an industry where they're not gonna

788
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:53,628
be able to make money as soon as those

789
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:55,338
laws are lifted they're gonna be coming

790
00:34:53,628 --> 00:34:58,098
in hungry as can be the only way we can

791
00:34:55,338 --> 00:35:00,068
survive is being individuals being true

792
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:02,028
to what we believe in having a cause

793
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:03,739
putting something out there not

794
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:05,900
necessarily even the greatest bud but

795
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:07,278
the greatest you know care for the

796
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,289
environment the greatest care for our

797
00:35:07,278 --> 00:35:10,789
community that's how we can set

798
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:12,289
ourselves apart and actually do

799
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:14,299
something good besides grow gray

800
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:18,500
cannabis and supply great patients with

801
00:35:14,298 --> 00:35:19,880
cannabis I believe we do that but I

802
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,650
think we should be coming together for

803
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,559
better causes for higher causes it's

804
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,500
what I like and so I know it might vary

805
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:29,859
a little bit because we're collecting

806
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,699
cannabis from Africa Thailand

807
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:34,298
Afghanistan a lot of different places

808
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:37,578
but kind of as sunshine was saying about

809
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:39,650
Oregon being a good place for wine and

810
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:41,839
now it's growing I am curious if anyone

811
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,329
has any recommendations on what to look

812
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,759
for as far as property or environment or

813
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:49,609
signs that maybe the terroir might be

814
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,760
something to work with he's asking about

815
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:56,239
looking for land here in Oregon to

816
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:59,270
produce amazing great cannabis and I

817
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:02,509
would say to that historically Williams

818
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:04,579
is has quite a long history of farming

819
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:07,190
there they have a lot of tradition and

820
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:10,609
that's one place that I would look at is

821
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:14,150
where where do you have the culture and

822
00:36:10,608 --> 00:36:16,429
the growing communities and dry farming

823
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:19,269
is amazing and they dry farm a lot of

824
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:21,769
grapes here in Oregon and they also have

825
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:23,509
small vineyards here in Oregon you got

826
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:25,219
organs in between Washington and

827
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,960
California these have these thousand

828
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:29,509
acre vineyards but Oregon's kept it

829
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,369
small and there's something

830
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:33,949
there's a message for us in that in how

831
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:37,249
they do the wine here and and the dry

832
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:40,099
farming as well so I would look also you

833
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:41,988
have in amazing volcanic soils here and

834
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:46,309
a lot of those soils I mean if you're

835
00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:49,159
looking at you have oceanic volcanics

836
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:51,199
mixed in with terrestrial volcanic sand

837
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:54,829
there's a lot of complexity in the soils

838
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:59,148
so you have very good farming here for

839
00:36:54,829 --> 00:37:00,318
sure and then looking at your you

840
00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:04,278
definitely want to be looking at your

841
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:06,949
your South Face and in looking at that

842
00:37:04,278 --> 00:37:09,318
aspect and then as far as humidity and

843
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:11,209
dryness goes I grow where I have high

844
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:14,748
humidity next to the river and I like

845
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:16,728
that for my terpene development and so

846
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:18,288
that's the other part where if you're in

847
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:21,108
a hotter climate you might be getting

848
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:24,049
drier air and then that drier air it

849
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:26,239
could possibly raise your potency but it

850
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:28,309
may blow off some of your terpenes

851
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:31,519
there's challenges and growing in high

852
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:34,189
humidity with mold and so that's also

853
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:37,668
can be a problem if you're trying to

854
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:42,379
grow for flower but not so much if

855
00:37:37,668 --> 00:37:45,918
you're trying to grow for amazing whole

856
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:49,579
plant hash medicine that is really good

857
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:53,739
so it just depends on on what you want

858
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:59,599
to produce Oregon is is extremely unique

859
00:37:53,739 --> 00:38:01,630
because of the difference in number one

860
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:06,019
climate you know

861
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:07,939
elevation different regions get extreme

862
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:10,278
amounts of water and things like that I

863
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:13,699
went out to we went out to Sheridan

864
00:38:10,278 --> 00:38:17,358
about three years ago I was up in Oregon

865
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:19,909
City the difference between the water

866
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:22,998
table how clean the water was that we

867
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:26,419
got to use there in comparison to what

868
00:38:22,998 --> 00:38:29,178
we had and Sheridan the the Sheridan

869
00:38:26,418 --> 00:38:29,868
property was you know art when you pH

870
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:32,959
the water

871
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:35,239
you got a perp you know between a 5.8 to

872
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:38,838
a 6.0 and that's straight up out of the

873
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:41,059
creek you know and so that means that

874
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,400
the water table that's underneath my

875
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:45,850
ground they

876
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,780
is is based you know basically you know

877
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:51,759
less than 6.2 in in the pH level but you

878
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,470
also need to pH your soil out and things

879
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,470
to to find out what levels you have

880
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:58,480
there you know it's that's why

881
00:38:55,469 --> 00:39:00,909
hydroponic growers amazed me is because

882
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,460
this plant never grew in a creek

883
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:04,089
it never grew in a river it never grew

884
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,760
in a lake

885
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:11,079
and it never grew in the freaking ocean

886
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:14,680
okay so I'm sorry it just never happened

887
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:18,940
so disconnecting the plant with Mother

888
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:21,069
Earth you're losing that 25 to 30

889
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,210
percent of properties that normally you

890
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,850
would get from the microbes and

891
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:28,980
bacterias that you get from the soils

892
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:32,019
Oregon is rich with medical ground I

893
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:35,920
there's no other way to put it all the

894
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:38,739
way up until 1934 a horse could walk out

895
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,909
to the edge of the field and eat a bud

896
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:46,119
off of a plant and heal an illness a cow

897
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:49,149
could do the same thing sheep everything

898
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:52,779
animals lived a lot longer in the early

899
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:55,000
1900s because the animals went naturally

900
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:58,600
to the hemp into cannabis that was

901
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,469
growing freely you know so Oregon has

902
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:04,299
it's very own distinction in the way the

903
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:06,849
Sun comes through here and then the way

904
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,519
the moisture comes through here and the

905
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:13,389
waves that it comes through enriches the

906
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:17,440
soil so much and and it's it's the idea

907
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:19,659
of correctly using your outdoor

908
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,570
environment in order to produce the best

909
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:25,869
that you can you want to save your

910
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:28,600
medical market okay the way to do it is

911
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:29,679
to think back to why you started growing

912
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:33,099
in the first place

913
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:35,469
you know and and those original lessons

914
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:38,319
that you learned forget the science and

915
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:40,329
break it down to the soil break it down

916
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,920
to the Sun and break it down to your

917
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:43,920
genetics make it simple

918
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,780
have a question for the audience how

919
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,210
many of you have any kind of

920
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:58,030
supplemental lighting to support your

921
00:40:52,210 --> 00:41:02,460
farms not that many yeah so how many of

922
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:04,920
you are just growing just pure only son

923
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,829
no supplemental lighting whatsoever

924
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,360
that's impressive

925
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:12,210
that's impressive well I wanted to just

926
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:15,940
ask the Niraj and a quick question about

927
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:18,099
the difference between artificial

928
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:23,820
lighting whether that's high pressure

929
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:28,230
sodium LED metal halide and sunshine

930
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:31,570
okay well that's a long question but

931
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:41,280
quickly yes of course

932
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:49,240
that's like telling hot quickly so

933
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:51,910
sunlight as sunshine described it coming

934
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:54,729
here to earth is the energy source of

935
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:58,449
the whole world all of us everything

936
00:41:54,730 --> 00:42:00,579
right it creates that energy so we

937
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:03,219
definitely as Kat said want you to grow

938
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:07,239
outdoors if you can but if you can't

939
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:09,730
then doing with HPS or LEDs is probably

940
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,889
the worst thing you can do and the

941
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:13,929
reason is and maybe HPS is probably

942
00:42:11,889 --> 00:42:16,629
better than any of them which is

943
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:19,119
probably a crazy thing to do maybe a

944
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:21,460
little metal halide but that would be

945
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,250
like feeding your children whatever they

946
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:27,150
like the most favorite thing all the

947
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:29,530
time let's say it's just strawberries

948
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:32,980
and that's all you do is keep our

949
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:35,140
potatoes you got I grew my children only

950
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:37,630
on potatoes look at it it's beautiful

951
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:40,420
it's big look how big my kid is six foot

952
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:44,110
four you need potatoes well does he get

953
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:46,240
all the nutrients No so all these lights

954
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:48,700
are working in about 23% of the Sun

955
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:51,250
spectrum not only the radiant flux with

956
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:53,829
the electromagnetic flux meaning the

957
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:57,219
particles and the waveforms are not

958
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:58,719
coming to your plant so you're you're

959
00:42:57,219 --> 00:43:01,899
really in essence

960
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:03,909
and to the microbes yes of course and so

961
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,530
you want to be able to penetrate down

962
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:08,500
with the green light the green light

963
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:10,720
they always poopoo green light so no the

964
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,539
Sun that the plant reflects green light

965
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,949
no it doesn't it absorbs green light it

966
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:17,079
allows it to go through that's what

967
00:43:14,949 --> 00:43:19,838
allows the penetration so you want to

968
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:21,430
activate your microbes you want it to

969
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,289
have this really beautiful symbiotic

970
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:25,480
relationship which is what happens in

971
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:29,170
the beautiful redwood trees here in

972
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,789
Oregon right so that's the kind of

973
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:33,608
atmosphere that's what you want to set

974
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:35,529
up in your grows indoors so when we

975
00:43:33,608 --> 00:43:38,710
design the light we actually wanted

976
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,540
full-spectrum exactly every one of those

977
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:43,659
quarter wave eighth wave everything the

978
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:45,250
Sun does to be available rather than one

979
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:48,219
specific margin and you're trying to

980
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:50,650
guess it and so growers have tried to

981
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:53,439
dial it in well no there's no dialing it

982
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:55,059
in that plants dialed it in you're just

983
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,338
provided it's something it's the one

984
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:58,869
that's doing all the work not you so

985
00:43:57,338 --> 00:44:01,088
don't even think you're doing that when

986
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:03,700
you're doing something artificial and so

987
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:06,578
now you got to make up for just give me

988
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:10,179
a few seconds so now you got to make up

989
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:12,730
for by chemicals because you can't give

990
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:14,858
it everything just like we do now we

991
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:17,139
don't take care of our lower gut 70% of

992
00:44:14,858 --> 00:44:18,940
our immune system is the air so what do

993
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:20,889
we do we go to Costco and buy a bunch of

994
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:23,800
vitamin D but it because you're not

995
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:25,210
getting it out of your food you got to

996
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,240
get it out of your food which is the

997
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:31,720
same thing with your plant so what

998
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:34,358
happens with LEDs it's actually harmful

999
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:36,159
to you it's harmful for people people

1000
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:38,469
know that they studies on this and

1001
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:41,670
you're just giving it one sharp same

1002
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:44,108
thing with with high pressure sodium

1003
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,650
it'll grow as you well know with a

1004
00:44:44,108 --> 00:44:48,130
flashlight

1005
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:50,260
I mean it's a beautiful plant but don't

1006
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:51,940
give yourself credit so the reason I end

1007
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,589
up eating and they go oh look at all

1008
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,358
these great blood you know they look at

1009
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:57,099
it from a luminous flux what our eyes

1010
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:00,338
can see I'm not getting enough coverage

1011
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:03,700
really you can see ultraviolet you can

1012
00:45:00,338 --> 00:45:06,338
see infrared really that's really great

1013
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:07,779
if you know so so when you look at

1014
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:10,000
something in a we the way I'll prove

1015
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,550
this to and I'll stop cat is when you

1016
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,719
look at

1017
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:18,190
what's the bird in India with a

1018
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:22,089
beautiful plumage a peacock do you know

1019
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:27,450
what color a Precog is anybody know what

1020
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:30,690
color is a peacock it's gray

1021
00:45:27,449 --> 00:45:34,509
seriously it's gray

1022
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:38,230
everything about that point is gray but

1023
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:42,220
the way nature biomimicry creates edges

1024
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:44,800
in that feather reflects refracts the

1025
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:47,289
color to your eyes you think it's blue

1026
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:53,230
and green and red and all that but it's

1027
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:55,509
not it's not so when you walk into a

1028
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,329
grow room and you go oh I got light

1029
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:01,390
coverage here's my par meter let me give

1030
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:04,000
it 23% of it now you wonder why and then

1031
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:07,109
you create these hybrids that are poison

1032
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:11,289
so either you're doing poison weed

1033
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:13,420
seriously are you doing cannabis right

1034
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:15,070
that's all you're doing if you're doing

1035
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,809
outdoors and you're not and you're doing

1036
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:20,530
regenerative lee and you're doing living

1037
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:22,329
soil that's medicine anything above and

1038
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:28,840
beyond that with HPS or anything is

1039
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:29,019
poison sorry I just want to add one

1040
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,789
thing

1041
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:32,530
so in teaming with microbes I always say

1042
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:35,710
you know 50 to 60 percent of the

1043
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:37,690
photosynthetic energy is used by the

1044
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,909
plant to produce the exudates that drip

1045
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:42,550
out into the soil if you're using an LED

1046
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:45,329
light if you're using an HP s light you

1047
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:48,450
are not allowing the plant to

1048
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:50,500
efficiently and easily get that

1049
00:46:48,449 --> 00:46:52,000
photosynthetic energy that it's using to

1050
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,679
make those X units that's the first

1051
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,179
thing the second thing is in teaming

1052
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,250
with nutrients I point out that there

1053
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:59,649
are 17 nutrients that make everything

1054
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:02,710
that's in that plant we can put down all

1055
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,329
a garbage we want that's made by you

1056
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:05,710
know general hydroponic etcetera it says

1057
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:08,259
it doesn't make a damn bit of difference

1058
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:10,570
it's those 17 nutrients that you gotta

1059
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:13,840
have so that the plant can make what it

1060
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:16,240
needs to make all right if you don't and

1061
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,860
the plant makes everything using the

1062
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,449
photosynthetic energy and some of the

1063
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,690
energy that's made by the mitochondria

1064
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:24,239
if you don't have a

1065
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:26,730
fish and source of energy coming in in

1066
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,619
terms of light the plant has to struggle

1067
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:30,990
to do it and that's why you end up with

1068
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:34,170
poison or cannabis that's not really the

1069
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:36,809
kind of cannabis that we want so so we

1070
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:40,260
know this in the in the agricultural

1071
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:44,009
field because we know that from 1948 or

1072
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:46,920
45 after World War 2 on our nutritional

1073
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:48,740
value in a bowl of salad has gone down

1074
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,119
to the point where it's worthless now

1075
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:52,799
because of the inputs that we put into

1076
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,359
the soil because a lot of this stuff is

1077
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,700
grown indoors a lot of the stuff is

1078
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,940
grown hydroponically we know it we know

1079
00:47:56,699 --> 00:48:01,710
it from the food side of it the same

1080
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,079
thing applies to the cannabis side of it

1081
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:06,269
we know it and and yet we still go out

1082
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,849
and buy an LED light because it's

1083
00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:12,000
cheapest we can afford it it's efficient

1084
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:13,980
you know rather than trying to grow the

1085
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,420
plant outside first of all where you

1086
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,010
don't have to put on all these inputs

1087
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,440
and second of all trying to figure out a

1088
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:21,480
way to grow it inside as close to

1089
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,250
possible as it is outside that's what

1090
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:27,179
we're supposed to be doing not the

1091
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:29,400
cheapest way but the natural way and we

1092
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:31,589
tend in this industry to go the cheapest

1093
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,720
way the most efficient way as opposed to

1094
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:43,050
the natural way which is really what I

1095
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:45,859
think we ought to be doing so if you

1096
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:49,650
could maybe explain the importance of

1097
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:52,160
like ancestral growing dried farming and

1098
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:54,329
boosting community as well as

1099
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:58,409
incorporating Jeff's teaming with

1100
00:48:54,329 --> 00:49:00,449
microbes series sins light on demand as

1101
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:02,159
well as the genetics here don't you feel

1102
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:04,980
like we're we could possibly be in a

1103
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:08,159
Golden Age of possibilities and new

1104
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:10,650
possibilities within the Canas genome

1105
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:14,190
itself and maybe even going back to

1106
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:16,050
where we had access via trade routes

1107
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,579
like the Silk Road or seafaring trade

1108
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:19,710
routes that maybe those landrace

1109
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:22,159
genetics were being bred through

1110
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:25,800
different countries that just were using

1111
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:28,230
axe or they were just using selection

1112
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,850
through thousands of seeds as opposed to

1113
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:33,510
maybe ten seeds that were used to now

1114
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:38,639
can you maybe touch on that stuff

1115
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:44,490
okay so so it's commonly known that that

1116
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:47,420
in in in full variables that there's

1117
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:52,409
approximately 136 original land races

1118
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:56,849
from around the world and within about

1119
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:59,659
four hundred years that tripled because

1120
00:49:56,849 --> 00:50:01,980
of cross-pollination due to you know

1121
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:03,449
regions that they were growing in and so

1122
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,760
on and so forth and that's why you get

1123
00:50:03,449 --> 00:50:07,858
some of your breakdowns of the different

1124
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,990
types of Afghani or the different you

1125
00:50:07,858 --> 00:50:10,679
know your your base sativas and so on

1126
00:50:09,989 --> 00:50:13,529
and so forth

1127
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:15,239
one of the one of the pure strains that

1128
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:18,330
I was able to locate was called la

1129
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:21,569
Juanita lacrimosa Jane the tearful

1130
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:22,799
maiden I went over to Spain I spent 90

1131
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:26,369
days over there I worked with a

1132
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,200
cultivator just outside of Barcelona he

1133
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:31,710
actually gave me the entire history of

1134
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:35,899
that strain and it dates back to the

1135
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:39,599
plague first first getting to Spain and

1136
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:42,930
nun in a cloister had been growing the

1137
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:46,440
la Juanita they they used it as natural

1138
00:50:42,929 --> 00:50:47,489
medicine it was it grew inside the I

1139
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,730
don't know what you call it the

1140
00:50:47,489 --> 00:50:54,118
courtyard of of that of that convent

1141
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:56,550
there and when she saw the signs of the

1142
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,990
plague in the fishermen's village she

1143
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:00,300
went up there and stripped all the

1144
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:02,819
leaves off the plant boiled them in

1145
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,430
water and went down and served that tea

1146
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,680
to everyone okay

1147
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:11,480
only people who died from the plague

1148
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:13,769
during that period and of infestation

1149
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,079
were the people who did not drink the

1150
00:51:13,769 --> 00:51:19,889
tea who refused to drink it they thought

1151
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:23,279
it was a devil's you know thing okay so

1152
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:24,868
and and the preservation of that was

1153
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,980
actually carried on through the

1154
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:31,619
religious sect not so much as the common

1155
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:34,710
farmer you know having it available to

1156
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:36,510
them and when villagers got sick they

1157
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:40,139
would go to see the nuns the nuns would

1158
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:42,150
take care of them but the name of the

1159
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:45,719
strain actually came because of the

1160
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:47,130
woman she was beheaded you know by the

1161
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:49,559
king of Spain

1162
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:53,130
for healing those people there was a

1163
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:55,860
land deal involved and they needed the

1164
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:58,980
villages cleared out so that they could

1165
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:00,660
build a French port and Isabella would

1166
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:04,170
have married the king of Spain at that

1167
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:06,359
time and it was at that time that they

1168
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:08,849
found out that this woman altered their

1169
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,920
plans and there's a famous painting that

1170
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:12,750
it was done of the woman hanging upside

1171
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,460
to her body upside down in the form of a

1172
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:16,110
cross in her head in the spike right

1173
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,659
next to it but did koi stirs in the

1174
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:20,940
background of the painting and in the

1175
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:33,269
window you will see the hundred percent

1176
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:37,530
sativa leaf yeah it was tripled tripled

1177
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:39,750
to quadrupled so so in from well that

1178
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:41,430
would be from today we're talking about

1179
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:43,559
four hundred years because you have to

1180
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:45,539
remember HAMP was in huge production

1181
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,599
back at the beginning and establishment

1182
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:50,969
of this country so we had seeds coming

1183
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:53,639
in from all over all the European

1184
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:56,879
continents you know between Spain God

1185
00:52:53,639 --> 00:53:00,739
you know and Ireland Scotland every

1186
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:04,559
place that they you know even Rome Italy

1187
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:08,219
Italy was known for some of the best

1188
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:10,860
highest grade hemp available for making

1189
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:13,739
you know for clothing and for sales so

1190
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:16,890
you think about a lot of the strains

1191
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:19,589
that that were crossed into the original

1192
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:21,319
land races or hemp that were crossed

1193
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:23,250
into it and that's where you'll find

1194
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:26,160
variations when you do a hundred seeds

1195
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:29,460
you can find a variation of a seed that

1196
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:31,049
gives you a higher CBD value to it so

1197
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,480
it's important that when you get the

1198
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:36,060
plant to this tall that you take a cut

1199
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,269
of it grow it out you know do it do a

1200
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:41,699
quick flower of it and get a CBD value

1201
00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:44,460
on it get your THC values find out what

1202
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:46,049
your CBG values are you know with having

1203
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:48,990
the laboratories available through with

1204
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:52,620
us that we have today we should be able

1205
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:54,419
to break down all of the individual

1206
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:56,309
cannabinoids to a point where there's

1207
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,880
not an illness on this planet that we

1208
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:58,880
can't fix

1209
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:06,820
you know I think when the creator

1210
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:09,059
reached his finger down and touched a

1211
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:12,910
spot and the first cannabis plant grew

1212
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:18,460
he knew exactly what he was doing okay

1213
00:54:12,909 --> 00:54:20,500
and up until man got in the way in 1928

1214
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,630
man got in the way

1215
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,400
okay I don't think our federal

1216
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:26,230
government should collect any taxes I

1217
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,389
don't think our states should collect

1218
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:30,099
any taxes I don't think our Police

1219
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:33,309
Department should be using any money

1220
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:36,670
raised from this okay because they lied

1221
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:39,659
to you for 75 years they lied to you

1222
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:41,680
they took this out of a doctors hands

1223
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:43,598
okay so that they could push a

1224
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:46,449
pharmaceutical industry that has done

1225
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:50,559
nothing but cause harm and cause macular

1226
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:55,739
degeneration to the human genetic that

1227
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,739
is today and we need to take it back I

1228
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:05,799
my Panama red came out like Panama red

1229
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:07,929
and I'm talking 1974-1975 Panama red and

1230
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,130
if you came out to the farm I would

1231
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:13,719
smoke something with you and you'd be

1232
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:17,769
you'd be happy you met Panama red okay

1233
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:20,348
it said this is the one thing you know

1234
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:21,880
the the the the difference between okay

1235
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:22,570
when you put a plant outside for the

1236
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,789
first time

1237
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:27,280
okay generally within seven to nine days

1238
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:28,690
it starts to you know you're you're

1239
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,010
starting to get your boost growth and

1240
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:31,869
everything but it can take you up to

1241
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:33,609
thirty days to finally get a sex on that

1242
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:36,480
plant unless you're using something like

1243
00:55:33,608 --> 00:55:39,730
Philo's okay but I can't recommend

1244
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,889
laboratories for sexy okay there was a

1245
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:44,889
point that I thought I could but I

1246
00:55:41,889 --> 00:55:49,838
cannot do that I had an 80% you know

1247
00:55:44,889 --> 00:55:53,559
success you know rate no is 80% success

1248
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:55,358
rate with getting females out of the

1249
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:58,389
seeds that we were you know that we were

1250
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:59,679
that we were germinating for the first

1251
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:02,319
two years but as soon as the

1252
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:05,829
recreational kicked in and everybody was

1253
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:08,680
doing it I think time became a

1254
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:12,400
constraint again it boils down to profit

1255
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:17,139
last year's test results were

1256
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:19,900
percent inaccurate 90% okay now you

1257
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:22,690
think about that I grow for 23 patients

1258
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:24,760
that we have cards for everybody else

1259
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:26,650
gets their medicine for free all the

1260
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:29,410
excess that we grow on our farm

1261
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:31,809
I sell plants that's what I do I don't

1262
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:34,420
sell buds you will never see my buds

1263
00:56:31,809 --> 00:56:36,579
you'll see my strings in the dispensary

1264
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,860
any of if any of you've ever smoked or

1265
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:40,929
consumes a strawberry express that was

1266
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:43,539
designed for adult seizures it works I

1267
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:46,779
created it it's I worked my ass off in

1268
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:48,279
order to do it and I don't care who

1269
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,960
takes credit for it but the original

1270
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,260
name was strawberry - - but they

1271
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:56,170
wouldn't let me use - - it was a it's

1272
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:58,300
mazar-i-sharif that's the land race of

1273
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:59,860
Saudi Arabia crossed with the time Rhett

1274
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,800
from Southern California that's a

1275
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:04,690
natural grown mountain side plant okay

1276
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,330
and then infused with Kyle kushman

1277
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:10,659
Strawberry Cough okay I went from having

1278
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:12,369
18 seizures a day to maybe two maybe

1279
00:57:10,659 --> 00:57:15,219
three and that's it

1280
00:57:12,369 --> 00:57:17,230
and now after continued use I'd make an

1281
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:19,480
RSO from it I do a quarter gram of it

1282
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:22,630
every morning and I haven't had a

1283
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:25,269
seizure you know well I haven't one

1284
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:29,400
periodically you know and it's generally

1285
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:29,400
due to stress when I get overexcited but

1286
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:36,010
my question goes back to the theme of

1287
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:39,219
today's talk which is the preservation

1288
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:41,800
of land rinses there seems to be out of

1289
00:57:39,219 --> 00:57:46,049
prohibition into this becoming more of a

1290
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:49,350
medically accepted therapeutic agent -

1291
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:53,710
almost like a green rush towards

1292
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:56,049
crossing land rinses with other strains

1293
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:59,679
- then achieve a certain outcome with

1294
00:57:56,050 --> 00:58:01,000
certain pathology or with that said just

1295
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:03,699
to use your example sir a little bit

1296
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,920
earlier with green house medical you see

1297
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:07,719
these companies as genetic banks going

1298
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,150
to places like Congo and Brazil in

1299
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:12,789
Colombia in taking these land races and

1300
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:15,490
in patan that knowledge later so that

1301
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:17,619
the indigenous people that have been

1302
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:20,500
growing this for me for thousands of

1303
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:23,409
years are now having to buy this back

1304
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:24,929
from the rich world

1305
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:27,769
[Music]

1306
00:58:24,929 --> 00:58:30,179
so with all the amazing benefits that

1307
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:32,849
preserving these land rinses bring to us

1308
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:34,469
how can we also ensure that when you

1309
00:58:32,849 --> 00:58:36,510
think of the war on drugs and the people

1310
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:39,239
disproportionately affected by this this

1311
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:40,980
prohibition don't suffer because we are

1312
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:43,828
so busy preserving them that we're

1313
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:57,150
actually extinguishing them by crossing

1314
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:59,640
them so III do tissue cultures of all of

1315
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:02,880
my genetics I have two refrigerators

1316
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:04,019
that are completely filled and I will

1317
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,030
keep them preserved for as long as

1318
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:08,818
possible and I have a hundred and thirty

1319
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:10,859
two of the listed four hundred and

1320
00:59:08,818 --> 00:59:15,088
ninety-eight you know strains that are

1321
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:20,690
available and we we do do breeding and

1322
00:59:15,088 --> 00:59:23,969
we do that intentionally to zero in on

1323
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:27,000
effectiveness okay a prime example for

1324
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:28,739
you is I brought back a pure Afghani

1325
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,900
when I came home from the Marine Corps

1326
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:35,608
we won't have too much of a conversation

1327
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:38,700
about that but it was the the best pain

1328
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:42,659
reliever down to earth pain reliever

1329
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:45,088
that I ever ever grew and the one

1330
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:47,489
problem that I was having was okay it's

1331
00:59:45,088 --> 00:59:49,529
let's simplify it a person who's in pain

1332
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:53,879
24 hours a day is predisposed to be an

1333
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:56,460
they're always in pain okay so

1334
00:59:53,880 --> 01:00:01,559
what if you could take away their pain

1335
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:02,818
and change their attitude because if you

1336
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:04,940
can change the attitude then you bring

1337
01:00:02,818 --> 01:00:08,489
the socialization back which

1338
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:10,380
communication and community help to

1339
01:00:08,489 --> 01:00:12,479
rebuild and regenerate and rehabilitate

1340
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:14,670
the individual not that you have to hold

1341
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,650
that person up or hold their hand okay

1342
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:19,889
it's just through common communication

1343
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:23,579
so we took a pre 79 euphoria which was

1344
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:27,719
known for taking a woman who can go from

1345
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:30,930
0 to in 3 seconds and turning that

1346
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:34,949
switch off so that she becomes mom again

1347
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:38,309
you know or that that person who is

1348
01:00:34,949 --> 01:00:41,730
suffering from you know I

1349
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:45,179
PTSD type issues that snap to judgment

1350
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:47,460
or snap to reaction to what you see you

1351
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:49,230
know happening around you so the idea of

1352
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,159
it was was take away the pain and

1353
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:52,199
changed the attitude

1354
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:55,349
well we achieved that goal in creating

1355
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:57,419
the you Ghani and that was crossing

1356
01:00:55,349 --> 01:01:01,949
those two strains both of which are land

1357
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:03,900
race trains and then leaving it alone we

1358
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:05,579
left it alone after that but what we

1359
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,769
found was that it actually worked for a

1360
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:10,769
sight sound odor / alertness / awareness

1361
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:14,099
and paranoia in a veteran giving the

1362
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:19,050
individual back but getting rid of the

1363
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:21,119
symptoms of all of the PTSD so it's

1364
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,460
there's a certain point where you should

1365
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,409
cross you know and try and find an

1366
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,909
effective change but there's also a

1367
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:30,179
certain point that you should allow it

1368
01:01:26,909 --> 01:01:31,349
to go it's things should not after think

1369
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:34,230
something's been crossed

1370
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:36,329
you know you cross it back to and ensure

1371
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:38,849
that you have a stabilized

1372
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:41,519
fino out of it and then at that point

1373
01:01:38,849 --> 01:01:44,069
there do testing you know so when you

1374
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,840
find something that works test it on

1375
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:48,330
other people that have the same type of

1376
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:50,519
issues and see what the reactions are as

1377
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:54,360
growers what you should be doing when

1378
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:56,940
you take a strain into a dispensary take

1379
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:59,370
a little make little cards okay so that

1380
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:01,289
when a patient goes in and get your

1381
01:01:59,369 --> 01:02:03,809
product and takes it home that there's

1382
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:05,969
ten questions on there and you tell them

1383
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:08,309
listen if you answer all these honestly

1384
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:10,409
and you bring this back in or mail this

1385
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:12,539
out to us okay the next time you go in

1386
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:15,539
you're gonna get 10% off or 20% off of

1387
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:17,730
your product but over a 30-day period of

1388
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:20,550
them testing your medicine you can

1389
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:23,159
actually pinpoint what works and what

1390
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:25,170
doesn't work but what you're gonna find

1391
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:27,179
is that by going back to the original

1392
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:32,849
land raced range you can actually target

1393
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:37,980
better so the other part of that to

1394
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:41,279
answer your question the land races have

1395
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:43,860
a whole lot of history and have been

1396
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,380
used by wise men and medicine man from

1397
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:49,500
my part of the country of the world to

1398
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,720
China so to go back to that gives you a

1399
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,820
reference

1400
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:54,230
and sort of like the Sun on-demand takes

1401
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:56,420
you back to the Sun which is your

1402
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:58,760
reference and if you can get the terroir

1403
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:59,780
there's your reference and if you come

1404
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,640
with a genetics

1405
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:04,430
there's your reference you're somewhere

1406
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:07,190
there the hybrids that have come about

1407
01:03:04,429 --> 01:03:12,739
is because it's called resistance

1408
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:15,559
farming right because you're resisting

1409
01:03:12,739 --> 01:03:17,449
nature as you go when you go indoors

1410
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:19,820
you're resisting nature so you have to

1411
01:03:17,449 --> 01:03:22,129
do something else so now you've got to

1412
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:24,890
take an Afghan and you've got a 28-day

1413
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:27,079
cycle I need to make money so you know

1414
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:30,289
what limit how do you think OG Kush came

1415
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:32,210
along right because somebody wanted to

1416
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:33,829
make money they wanted a short cycle and

1417
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:40,010
they wanted to get a high so it's not

1418
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:42,739
all about THC it's not about THC it's

1419
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:44,330
about full plant extract it's about the

1420
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:46,269
ensemble effect because you know what

1421
01:03:44,329 --> 01:03:48,980
that plant has figured it out already

1422
01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:50,539
you trying to screw up in there you

1423
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:52,519
trying to go in there and try to do

1424
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:55,099
extractive and all that trying to be a

1425
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:58,250
farmer pharmaceutical company again is

1426
01:03:55,099 --> 01:03:59,960
totally excuse my French but it

1427
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:02,539
totally because you're

1428
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:05,150
poisoning the people you're cutting your

1429
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:06,500
own business and you're shortchanging

1430
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:09,880
you you're sure damn we can't look in

1431
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:13,429
the mirror now so let's go back to that

1432
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:16,039
so what hopefully we're trying to do

1433
01:04:13,429 --> 01:04:19,848
here is to talk about how do you create

1434
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:21,588
your own medicine for your patients how

1435
01:04:19,849 --> 01:04:25,280
do you differentiate yourself in the

1436
01:04:21,588 --> 01:04:27,108
marketplace as a small farmer and cat

1437
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,089
just give me a few seconds Laurent

1438
01:04:27,108 --> 01:04:31,759
right here in front of us is one of the

1439
01:04:29,088 --> 01:04:34,420
inventors of the light he's the first

1440
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:38,210
visit with us he's from Switzerland and

1441
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:44,180
thanks to sunshine we were invited to

1442
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:45,588
meet the farmers in Humboldt and the

1443
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:48,500
first thing he said after the night was

1444
01:04:45,588 --> 01:04:52,358
Sundaresh and we make lights they say

1445
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:55,309
yeah these are all outdoor farmers yeah

1446
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:59,360
why are we here like

1447
01:04:55,309 --> 01:05:02,000
dick you know and I said well yeah we

1448
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:04,039
want outdoor farming he wants outdoor

1449
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,079
farming he's got a young daughter that

1450
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:07,519
he doesn't want that kind of food being

1451
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,549
grown because we're doing food with it

1452
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:12,889
too so we could have sold out we could

1453
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:15,140
have gone in and had Sega Vita hey guys

1454
01:05:12,889 --> 01:05:16,460
I want to get a license we got to make a

1455
01:05:15,139 --> 01:05:19,429
significant amount of money but we're

1456
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:22,159
down here talking to people who care who

1457
01:05:19,429 --> 01:05:24,980
want to care about their patients who

1458
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:30,379
want to create medicine who want to do

1459
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:32,389
food growth so empower yourself instead

1460
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:35,450
of trying to be like everybody else in

1461
01:05:32,389 --> 01:05:37,940
the Gro find medicine that you want to

1462
01:05:35,449 --> 01:05:40,460
grow that you have in your heart that

1463
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:42,320
you would like to solve a lot of the

1464
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:44,059
growers that we talk to had personal

1465
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:46,550
experience Harry Rose would treat well

1466
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:48,349
although things went awry for him in his

1467
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:54,410
business model he's back again as

1468
01:05:48,349 --> 01:05:57,440
rosette down in California he was saved

1469
01:05:54,409 --> 01:06:00,799
by his own balanced tincture and that's

1470
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:02,450
why he's here so every I'm sure most of

1471
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:06,890
you have stories of people you've helped

1472
01:06:02,449 --> 01:06:08,389
or you helped yourself get that medicine

1473
01:06:06,889 --> 01:06:10,969
the one that you feel the most

1474
01:06:08,389 --> 01:06:13,279
passionate about and make it as best as

1475
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:15,589
you can you're gonna blow away everybody

1476
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:18,769
people can find their way to you if you

1477
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:23,539
do that in a very natural way even if

1478
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:25,849
it's indoors sorry yeah I just wanted to

1479
01:06:23,539 --> 01:06:28,730
answer your your question and it's true

1480
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:31,400
of intellectual property from indigenous

1481
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:33,710
people around the world is yeah it's

1482
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:37,550
being taken and being used commercially

1483
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:39,440
and so it's this has been happening

1484
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:41,090
across the amazon basin where

1485
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:45,530
pharmaceuticals coming in and finding us

1486
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:47,180
these plant medicines and it's we're not

1487
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:49,970
just facing it's not just about

1488
01:06:47,179 --> 01:06:51,649
preserving small farms here in Oregon or

1489
01:06:49,969 --> 01:06:53,959
in California but it's across the world

1490
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:57,079
women have been cultivating this

1491
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:59,449
medicine they have been getting its it's

1492
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:02,710
been allowing their children to to go to

1493
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:05,539
school and that still we need to keep

1494
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:08,909
those small farmers around the world

1495
01:07:05,539 --> 01:07:11,548
alive and and preserve that

1496
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:14,848
and with that I don't really know

1497
01:07:11,548 --> 01:07:17,730
exactly what the answer is around around

1498
01:07:14,849 --> 01:07:19,440
genetics and around I mean it's I don't

1499
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:21,630
want to see a surf system where it's

1500
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,519
like ok we come and take your genetics

1501
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:25,619
then we sell it back to you and then you

1502
01:07:23,518 --> 01:07:27,439
grow for us oh now you can make a living

1503
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:32,278
because you grow for us and that model

1504
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:33,838
cannot it may not be the right one part

1505
01:07:32,278 --> 01:07:35,909
of these genetics they're entering

1506
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:37,619
commercialism for the first time these

1507
01:07:35,909 --> 01:07:40,018
land races these were grow and not

1508
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:42,028
intended for money not whatsoever it was

1509
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:44,368
used for spiritual healing it was used

1510
01:07:42,028 --> 01:07:47,759
for healing people in this clash with

1511
01:07:44,369 --> 01:07:49,108
commercialism is it's it's it's very

1512
01:07:47,759 --> 01:07:58,048
real and it's something that we should

1513
01:07:49,108 --> 01:08:00,568
all be thinking about well I mean it's

1514
01:07:58,048 --> 01:08:03,179
pretty obvious that that I that we all

1515
01:08:00,568 --> 01:08:05,489
agree we want to have great genetics we

1516
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:08,038
want to have great light you know we

1517
01:08:05,489 --> 01:08:09,750
want to have natural soils I mean it

1518
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:14,579
just makes sense to do it that way and

1519
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:16,229
and I I just I'm always so impressed

1520
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:18,298
when I come to a talk like this and I

1521
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:20,099
listen to people and you know I have my

1522
01:08:18,298 --> 01:08:21,838
stupid ideas and then I hear somebody

1523
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,960
you know we find it make it even better

1524
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:27,028
and and you know this is this is what's

1525
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,579
so cool about this industry that I don't

1526
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:32,130
think we'll ever see the big guys doing

1527
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:33,719
we get together we share information you

1528
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:35,969
know I was like the I always like to say

1529
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:38,338
we're a bunch of we're just one big cell

1530
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:40,289
you know we're all enzymes in here and

1531
01:08:38,338 --> 01:08:42,509
we're all helping build a cell better

1532
01:08:40,289 --> 01:08:44,278
and that's what we do and and and it

1533
01:08:42,509 --> 01:08:46,469
doesn't matter whether you make money or

1534
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:49,650
not what matters is that you grow the

1535
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:50,189
best plant possible because that's what

1536
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:52,969
it's all about

1537
01:08:50,189 --> 01:08:55,919
we're supposed to be growing the best

1538
01:08:52,969 --> 01:08:58,100
plants possible so let's go forth and do

1539
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,100
it

1540
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:06,338
I just I just wanted to add to this

1541
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:09,130
conflict between between commercialism

1542
01:09:06,338 --> 01:09:11,738
Indian farmers and that is is that this

1543
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:13,239
this culture of gifting and sharing is

1544
01:09:11,738 --> 01:09:15,939
with the home grower and we should be

1545
01:09:13,238 --> 01:09:24,608
encouraging and be helping everyone home

1546
01:09:15,939 --> 01:09:28,988
grow okay so I'm gonna answer that so I

1547
01:09:24,609 --> 01:09:31,539
have a new book coming out on

1548
01:09:28,988 --> 01:09:34,088
autoflowering cannabis because I think

1549
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:35,920
that now that we've got the stigma going

1550
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:38,829
away and it's becoming legal in all the

1551
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,690
states and in Canada and Bolivia and

1552
01:09:38,829 --> 01:09:42,818
everyplace else it's the next tomato

1553
01:09:40,689 --> 01:09:46,028
this is the plant that my mother will

1554
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:48,220
grow when snap peas came out what I say

1555
01:09:46,029 --> 01:09:49,989
is is once or twice in a lifetime a new

1556
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:53,230
plant is developed for the home gardener

1557
01:09:49,988 --> 01:09:54,669
snap peas oh my god now there's 15

1558
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:57,029
different kinds of snap and I might add

1559
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:59,739
I think it started right here in Oregon

1560
01:09:57,029 --> 01:10:02,199
autoflowering cannabis gives you the

1561
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:05,259
ability to grow from from seed to a

1562
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:08,170
flower harvested seven to nine weeks

1563
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:09,640
that's the and you if you fertilize it

1564
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:12,130
too much you screw up the soil food web

1565
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,539
too much they don't grow well holy crow

1566
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:15,159
it's a plant that needs to be ignored

1567
01:10:13,539 --> 01:10:17,380
and assent to give it natural conditions

1568
01:10:15,159 --> 01:10:19,750
it does phenomenal they've improved the

1569
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:21,159
genetics now that we've got lights and

1570
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:24,069
things that we can even even make them

1571
01:10:21,159 --> 01:10:26,470
even better this is the plant that my

1572
01:10:24,069 --> 01:10:29,349
mother my sisters I don't have a sisters

1573
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:31,329
will grow at home because it's just like

1574
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:34,240
a tomato plant so it's coming folks and

1575
01:10:31,329 --> 01:10:35,460
the home gardener we need to support so

1576
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,869
[Music]

1577
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:40,420
speaking of that we do have a couple

1578
01:10:37,869 --> 01:10:42,399
books and a hat signed by Jeff's if

1579
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:44,710
you're a huge fan come up claim it we

1580
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:46,269
will we'll give that to you and then I

1581
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:47,920
think we're gonna turn on the light for

1582
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:51,010
anyone just interested in seeing this

1583
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:54,819
inside I've seen it a thousand times and

1584
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:56,949
I still am amazed every time it turns on

1585
01:10:54,819 --> 01:10:59,279
so if you have five minutes stick around

1586
01:10:56,948 --> 01:10:59,279
for that

1587
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:04,630
