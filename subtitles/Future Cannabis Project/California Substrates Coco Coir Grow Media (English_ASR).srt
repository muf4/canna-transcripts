[Music]

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:16,410
we're going to be taking a look at root

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,929
systems in California substrates Koya

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:23,550
Koya and one of the things first we're

5
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:26,129
going to see is that this particular pot

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,028
here will have quite a bit of a master

7
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,778
root on that part and if we go to the

8
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:32,909
other side

9
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,710
much less that's because in this

10
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:36,558
particular instance we had a dripper

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,570
that was pretty much only on one side

12
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,628
and if we take a look at this one I

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,850
believe here we look at it and the root

14
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:48,960
system is much more even all the way

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,850
around and it's not like we had a lot of

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,948
different drippers in there is basically

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,570
just two one on each side so the

18
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,899
distribution of water was more

19
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,460
completely even in the nutrient system

20
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,189
now what we're going to do is we're

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:07,260
going to take one of these pots and cut

22
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:09,868
it open we have a machete here because

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,520
we're gonna find that the root system

24
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:20,340
throughout the whole pot is relatively

25
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:23,039
even you can see yeah I'm in the mother

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,270
we're gonna try the saw bit just to get

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,640
through this one bit of a root I think

28
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:33,420
there we're through down to the bottom

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,659
and if we can look on here we've got

30
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:41,189
fine roots sitting all through the

31
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:43,409
middle of the pot they haven't gone sent

32
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:44,868
out big roots right to the outside the

33
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,479
edge and wrapped all the way around

34
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:50,969
we've got just a fine network of roots

35
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,819
around there and that is because the

36
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,399
coiour has such a good air fill porosity

37
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:59,938
in it and the other thing that it has is

38
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,269
a very it distributes the water very

39
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:06,898
well it absorbs and move sideways so you

40
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:10,079
get a reasonably equal amount of water

41
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,989
all the way around it and you have the

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,860
roots growing through the inside because

43
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,530
it has that good air

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,350
fill porosity I'm happy with this one I

45
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,810
think this is yeah it's got a it's got a

46
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:25,439
nice look to it you could grow a lot

47
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,180
longer in this because the the root

48
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,819
system certainly has a great deal more

49
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,800
air or room that it could be using in

50
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,930
there and through the middle it would

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,380
get thicker I've seen plants that have

52
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,629
grown in a pot a couple of years because

53
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,669
I used to grow roses and you'd have them

54
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:44,340
in there the root system so thick you

55
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:49,949
could just barely stick a watering pick

56
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:52,680
into the media the plants will continue

57
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:54,719
to grow and have roots and not really

58
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,390
look to go anywhere else as long as you

59
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,090
are providing the amount of water and

60
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:02,009
nutrients they that they want right

61
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,950
where their root system is and it will

62
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:08,729
grow that dense if you allow it if we

63
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:13,919
look at using coiour

64
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:17,819
versus soil soil the variabilities in

65
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,439
soil are well they're quite there's

66
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:25,819
quite a bit of it whether there is in

67
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:27,659
core also though the soil having

68
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:30,180
micronutrients in it and different

69
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,099
things is is a difficulty because you

70
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,489
never know exactly what you have and

71
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:42,150
what's going to be available you have

72
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:43,289
more organics more different chemicals I

73
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,000
guess you'd say it's not really

74
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,009
chemicals as we think of them because

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,709
usually think then of manmade chemicals

76
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:52,019
but these are natural chemicals that

77
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,840
appear in this soil and they will

78
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,090
interfere with the way different

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,930
nutrients are available to the plant

80
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:03,420
when you get into coiour most coiour is

81
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,900
not or shouldn't say most players not

82
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:09,059
buffered i was gonna say a lot of it is

83
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,209
but if you get it that corner that isn't

84
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,789
buffered the and as a very large can I

85
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:18,660
exchange capacity very heavily loaded

86
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:22,189
with sodium and potassium and when you

87
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:25,770
first start feeding this plant your

88
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:28,579
nutrients is going to

89
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:31,469
the the koi is going to start using the

90
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:33,959
calcium-magnesium on on the exchange

91
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,380
sites or draw it on to the exchange

92
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:40,409
sites where this potassium and sodium is

93
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:43,379
and as it attaches the calcium and

94
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:48,030
magnesium it will kick off the potassium

95
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:49,589
and sodium and your you nutrients become

96
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:51,839
out of balance

97
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,758
now potassium is not too bad although

98
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,318
when you get too much potassium it then

99
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,908
tends to inhibit the uptake of other

100
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:05,550
positive ions such as your calcium

101
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:09,990
magnesium iron a lot of your nutrients

102
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,550
are on the positive side sodium is the

103
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,009
other thing that gets kicked off of the

104
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,990
the counting exchange capacity it can

105
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:18,658
actually be quite detrimental to growth

106
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,150
of plants even as low as 12 parts per

107
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:23,519
million different plants different

108
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:27,120
species are have different tolerances

109
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:31,348
for it that's why if you get into a koi

110
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,000
that has been buffered then you get into

111
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:35,098
something that has already begun to

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,379
exchange or change the kind of exchange

113
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:41,098
capacity getting rid of the potassium

114
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:43,620
and sodium and already having attached

115
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:48,228
to calcium and magnesium this will give

116
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:51,269
you a coiler that has less of a problem

117
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:54,718
changing your doesn't change your

118
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:56,968
nutrient system so much however most of

119
00:05:54,718 --> 00:06:00,649
the coiours that have anacs-- that have

120
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:05,759
been buffered are not buffered

121
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:09,329
completely they leave a really quite a

122
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,030
large amount of the potassium sodium on

123
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:14,310
the exchange sites what they will do is

124
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:17,038
oftentimes in the last part of their

125
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,829
processing give it a huge hit of calcium

126
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:23,129
nitrate it's a very short period of time

127
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:27,329
10-15 minutes and then it's washed out

128
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:31,009
and then dried and packaged California

129
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:34,588
substrates uses a much longer method of

130
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:38,960
buffering their product and using a

131
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:42,709
heavier dose of magnesium and

132
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:45,500
calcium to do that so we bring the can

133
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:48,620
exchange capacity much more fully loaded

134
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,168
with calcium magnesium very little

135
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,379
potassium to be kicked off by your

136
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:57,019
nutrient system very little sodium and

137
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:58,759
and because we have done it that far

138
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:01,098
usually it won't won't interfere with

139
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,660
your nutrient system at all other

140
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:05,089
nutrients that are your you are

141
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,680
providing the plant when looking at

142
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:08,508
different types of coiour

143
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,949
that you might buy there's quite a range

144
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:16,370
in prices that you can get not all cheap

145
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:20,478
koi is cheap and nasty not all the hop

146
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:23,389
top-end or top price koi is ultimately

147
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:25,430
good if you need to ultimately all that

148
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,750
worth it what you need to do is know a

149
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,848
bit about what you're looking for

150
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:33,860
inquire the cheapest of them is going to

151
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:36,110
probably come without a buffering and

152
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,949
possibly at this stage even without any

153
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:43,370
washing the EC is going to be 2 or

154
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:44,900
higher you won't notice anything about

155
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,968
the buffering and until you start to

156
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:48,799
feed it and then you're gonna notice

157
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:50,839
that you're gonna run out of calcium

158
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,199
magnesium your plants are going to be

159
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:57,649
work very poorly they may turn yellow

160
00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:02,750
and and virtually just die in California

161
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:06,709
substrate score it has a it has been

162
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,360
buffered we have a about 80 90 percent

163
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:11,388
of the fines have been taken out of it

164
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,460
so that as we looked at this air this

165
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:15,560
root system that we head down here and

166
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,598
we got the roots all the way through it

167
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,990
that's because we've taken a lot of the

168
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:23,718
fine material out of the core and you

169
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:28,370
continue to get a airspace throughout

170
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:30,560
the whole root ball and so the the plant

171
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,959
can use the whole of the root ball if

172
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,788
you don't have that oftentimes what you

173
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,918
find is you got this root mass and it's

174
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:38,629
just winding around the outside and it

175
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:40,429
doesn't really matter how much is he on

176
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:42,679
the inside it's just not using it

177
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:47,569
there's no air space in there the roots

178
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:48,679
need air as much as they do water you

179
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,990
always hear about people saying

180
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:53,778
something was over watered

181
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:56,389
having too much water is not so much of

182
00:08:53,778 --> 00:09:00,139
a problem not having enough air is more

183
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:02,269
so that's they say too much water it's

184
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:04,100
not enough air and that's where that

185
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:07,909
comes from that's where that that will

186
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:12,459
go down to when you're out there looking

187
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:15,169
for a core you ask a few questions in

188
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:17,199
some of the very good things about it

189
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:20,149
there's the fuel amount that have taken

190
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,459
the finer material out of there not many

191
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:24,679
um they don't do it because it costs

192
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:27,859
quite a bit to the manufacturer to do

193
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:30,319
that it takes out maybe 20% of the

194
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,289
volume of the core so right at the

195
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,410
beginning it's it's it costs whoever it

196
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:40,309
is that's making it 20% more because

197
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:41,809
they get 20% less - to sell the next

198
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:45,829
thing is going to be the buffering

199
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:48,649
process that they use you'll hear a lot

200
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:51,740
of things about which is better one way

201
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,539
or another trial and side by side side

202
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,500
by side test so the one thing that will

203
00:09:53,539 --> 00:10:02,659
tell you we say doesn't need cal-mag in

204
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:04,850
in our growing media and we've had many

205
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:08,088
people try it and grow it that way and

206
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:11,420
it it actually does not need to have any

207
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:15,580
a kalmec do a side by side where was

208
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:18,289
there was a the quality a coiour

209
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:22,879
can make such a difference in the way

210
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:24,708
your growth proceeds and you may not if

211
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,419
everything works just the way you're

212
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,778
supposed to just the way your the way

213
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:31,219
you've planned it to do then you

214
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:33,379
everything will work out and your plants

215
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:37,420
will come through and they'll grow what

216
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:40,009
seems to be the best you could have done

217
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:43,338
we all have mistakes we all have things

218
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:45,740
that happen to us is you forgot to do

219
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:47,620
one thing or another or the wind came

220
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,089
through and blew something over or

221
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,560
electricity went out for you know a

222
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:54,320
couple hours and enough that something

223
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:56,239
didn't happen that's when you begin to

224
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,528
know the difference between a better

225
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,919
quality and a less quality the run is

226
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:04,769
side by side we had one happen where we

227
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,458
had

228
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:13,379
two rows of plants one in California

229
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:15,828
substrates one in the local local

230
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,329
best-selling core that was in the area

231
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:21,058
going through it there was an incident

232
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:25,159
that happened with the new the nutrient

233
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:27,088
system and at the end of it we had the

234
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:28,738
California substrates coiler

235
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:32,429
all of the plants were sitting there

236
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:32,879
they were looking happy in the opposing

237
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:36,298
coiour

238
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,970
there were 50% dead they looked yellow

239
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:43,110
they looked weak they just brown and

240
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:45,839
just laying over and it Sun tell you he

241
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,610
run into one of those instances before

242
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,499
that you may think yes everything is

243
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,659
going well if you do a side by side

244
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:53,790
everything works just the way it's

245
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:56,009
supposed to you're still going to notice

246
00:11:53,789 --> 00:12:00,298
a difference in a better quality or

247
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:05,129
coiour it will let your plants grow more

248
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:07,139
to their fullest capabilities the the

249
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:12,749
mistakes that happen they will they will

250
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:15,329
point out the difference between failing

251
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:17,519
and growing but it's when everything

252
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:20,039
works and when you do a side by side

253
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,720
then you begin to see the actual quality

254
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,759
and what the coiour will do because a

255
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,389
good quality coil should allow that

256
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:31,169
plant to outperform a poor quality choir

257
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:32,970
no matter what the growing conditions

258
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:35,639
are what happens during the whole cycle

259
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,339
of growing that's why we say with

260
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,129
California substrates feed your weed not

261
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,920
your cocoa give the plants what they

262
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:46,259
need have a cocoa that allows the plant

263
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,938
to use what you're giving them and not

264
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:51,149
to be adjusting it because the cocoa

265
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:55,528
needs the calcium magnesium how I got

266
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:59,548
into using cocoa and working with cocoa

267
00:12:55,528 --> 00:13:04,019
I started out growing I grew roses first

268
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:06,629
in in in soil vinaigrette in a bed the

269
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:09,778
bed was prepared it was it was they were

270
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:11,459
growing well because we had dug a trench

271
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:14,220
in the ground we put a tile in the

272
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,498
bottom we put sand over the top P rock

273
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,720
over the top of that then a prepared

274
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:21,060
soil over that we got the drainage one

275
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,509
we got everything that we wanted in the

276
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:27,059
proper ways and we thought we were doing

277
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:33,620
quite well then we went into hydroponics

278
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:36,359
using cocoa using rockwool and

279
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,039
immediately we came out of this came out

280
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,600
of the ground immediately we didn't

281
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:45,480
change anything else we got a 20% 25%

282
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:49,560
change in production and we kept numbers

283
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,990
on this week specific numbers by variety

284
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,679
of roses and we saw the the difference

285
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:57,180
in growth right away then when they

286
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:02,128
started were first started working with

287
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:04,138
cocoa it was kind of the oldest cheapest

288
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:09,509
nastiest stuff you can find around these

289
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:14,028
days and we were growing in in using it

290
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:16,589
it's still outperformed soil we we began

291
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:19,649
taking water samples and we would take a

292
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:22,259
water sample of the the drain water

293
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:24,539
coming out of these every week and we

294
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:27,990
would send it in and have it examined we

295
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:30,058
began to notice that the calcium that we

296
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,759
were feeding was at about 200 parts per

297
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:38,338
million what was coming out was less

298
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:40,139
than 10 parts per million of calcium so

299
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,269
what we did was we up the calcium by

300
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:46,019
about 50 percent so we went up to 300

301
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:49,198
and no difference in the change in the

302
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:52,799
amount of calcium that was coming

303
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:56,639
through the core in the drain water and

304
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:58,019
we went up to another think we doubled

305
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,669
it after that so it would have been up

306
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:02,698
about about 600 and I say I think

307
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:04,500
because this was 15 years ago or

308
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:07,500
something like that and and not

309
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,799
everything is remembered exactly but so

310
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:14,578
we did the extra calcium again and still

311
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,198
got no difference in the the drainage it

312
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:18,568
might have went from 10 to 15 percent

313
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:21,679
but essentially nothing and that went on

314
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:21,679
for about six months

315
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,528
shortly after that I we began looking at

316
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:31,819
different ways we could treat koi and

317
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:34,250
then I left the employment of a

318
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,070
a rose range and went to work for a

319
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,840
courier company and we began looking at

320
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:42,590
how we could treat coiour

321
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,930
go to the going into Sri Lanka and India

322
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:49,550
looking at how they made this stuff how

323
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:52,279
they process this and and gradually

324
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:54,319
began working with saving materials so

325
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:57,019
we brought out different grades of

326
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:01,060
products at that time we were we were

327
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:03,649
working not necessarily a use core only

328
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:05,959
but mixing with perlite and having

329
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:08,299
something that was more open and so we

330
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:12,110
had a grade that we call the three to

331
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:13,819
six and it was everything that was three

332
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,409
mils and under had been saved out and

333
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,350
everything six mils and over had been

334
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:20,480
saved out as a drawing material made a

335
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,940
very nice thing it actually was a little

336
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,680
bit too much on the dry side but it was

337
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,020
through these processes of working out

338
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,759
different different grades of coiours

339
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,399
and what could be done with them and

340
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:34,909
then also working on adding the

341
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:39,169
different nutrients into the system

342
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:42,529
while we were in the country of origin

343
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:43,879
that we be that we fell into enough fell

344
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:46,610
into it because it was actually a

345
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:49,549
process of thinking about and and

346
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,460
running testing and seeing how how it

347
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:53,870
could be down and how long it would take

348
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,530
so I've been working with koi or in

349
00:16:53,870 --> 00:17:02,620
trying to perfect the way to do it for

350
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:08,149
10 15 years started back in in probably

351
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:11,349
1996 didn't really start working with an

352
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:14,570
acquire company until about 2000 2001

353
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:18,349
and we've been working on improving koi

354
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:20,899
or since at California substrates we

355
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:23,480
believe that the continually improving

356
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,759
coiour we believe also that what we need

357
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,099
to do is take out the things that are

358
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,829
not good for their growth or not

359
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:34,039
positive in the in the koi or taking out

360
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:35,929
the fines correcting the the can't

361
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:38,629
exchange capacity by getting rid of the

362
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,230
potassium and the sodium so that you as

363
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,610
a grower don't have to correct those

364
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,380
deficiencies in the coiour we also

365
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:47,719
believe that there are going to be

366
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,060
more things that we will have to improve

367
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,900
coiour and it will get better it's a

368
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:57,529
it's a process of continual improvement

369
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,960
perlite perlite is a a mix in your cocoa

370
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:02,059
the if you have treated if the cocoa has

371
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,710
been treated properly and come to you

372
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:06,529
you shouldn't need anything and

373
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,930
California substrates were quite adamant

374
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:11,180
the fact that you don't need perlite you

375
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,220
need hydro town or any other thing else

376
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,160
added as far as it's giving you air

377
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:19,400
space if you use perlite you'll notice

378
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,800
that the roots within your your growing

379
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,430
media will tend to migrate to where

380
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:28,460
there is air but in general where

381
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:34,160
there's air when you're adding perlite

382
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:37,160
or other things that add air air field

383
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,440
to your media you don't find nutrient

384
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,690
there if you look again in our in our

385
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,759
root ball

386
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,500
we don't have perlite or anything into

387
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,480
there but we've got root system

388
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,119
everywhere through there that's because

389
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,470
there's air and nutrients there if you

390
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:53,719
have poor lighting there you're gonna

391
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:56,630
find the roots are going to come to the

392
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,329
outside because there's air they're very

393
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,450
minimal nutrient because it only then

394
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:04,490
has the nutrient on the inside the

395
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:07,430
outside of course is where the pot is

396
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:09,670
and there's no nutrient out there if you

397
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:12,590
you would also find that if you had

398
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:14,810
perlite through there the roots the fine

399
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:17,720
roots were most year nutrient is being

400
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:20,329
uptake up taken especially the micro

401
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,690
nutrients the fine roots are going to

402
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:25,429
gravitate toward where the perlite is

403
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,830
again no nutrient there there's going to

404
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:30,110
be air there but no nutrient and so you

405
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:31,579
will find the plant the roots get to

406
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:35,629
there and there's nothing they can do

407
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:38,539
except to go back out into the into the

408
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:42,020
void where the air the air isn't and so

409
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:45,349
they have to struggle and using coiour

410
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:47,389
it it works in all all situations we

411
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:48,919
have indoor growers with computers and

412
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:52,070
everything around them to keep

413
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,580
everything just the way the grower wants

414
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:58,549
it to an outdoor grow where we're out

415
00:19:55,579 --> 00:20:02,029
open to the Sun we're growing

416
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:05,509
nice looking weed got nice sized buds on

417
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:08,359
it using California substrates coiour

418
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:11,808
these particular ones are in three

419
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:14,808
gallon pots the three gallon pots will

420
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:18,289
grow a very nice plant and it can be

421
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:20,539
quite large we find that outdoor is it's

422
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:23,539
a little bit top-heavy if we have a

423
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:26,389
system of supporting the tops of the the

424
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:29,178
plants they can remain upright and have

425
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,429
have less problems but we're thinking

426
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:33,679
maybe the the thing to do is going to be

427
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:36,080
some larger pot so they they don't get

428
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,000
quite so top-heavy the other would be to

429
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,609
put a stake along them to tie them down

430
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,529
so they can't go anywhere so there are

431
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:49,029
there are methods to to helping

432
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:49,029
difficulty like that but it is a very

433
00:20:52,240 --> 00:21:01,730
usable media in in pretty much any type

434
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:07,279
of a setting if you're under lights in a

435
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:11,420
in a in a a warehouse or in a plastic

436
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:15,379
structure it can do whatever you want to

437
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:19,539
do it can grow as big a plant as you

438
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:22,510
want the size of the pot is not any any

439
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:25,159
restriction on how big the plant can get

440
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:28,160
how big the plant can get is really

441
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,650
based upon how you provide nutrients and

442
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:34,250
how you provide the water that the plant

443
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:36,920
needs if you can provide nutrients in

444
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:41,089
water in short bursts all day long you

445
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:44,300
could grow a an 8 10 foot plant in a one

446
00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:46,639
gallon pot but the you would have to be

447
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:48,889
supplying water as quickly as that plant

448
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,470
is using it and you have less and less

449
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,929
of a buffer system so that when the

450
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,870
water is done how long before the water

451
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:58,400
and nutrient is being is used up the

452
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:02,019
bigger the pot you have the bigger the

453
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:06,170
buffer system you have for that plant to

454
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:07,910
get through an oops thing lack of water

455
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,548
something happens you get you can't get

456
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,308
the water to them Adam

457
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:14,490
when when they need to electricity goes

458
00:22:12,308 --> 00:22:25,348
out one of the things that comes to mind

459
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:25,348
