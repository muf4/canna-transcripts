2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:22,160
I emailed Sabrina Fenwick from BPG who's

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,039
not into the dynamic delivery thing and

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,289
I was like Sabrina mostly wins dynamic

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,810
delivery battle I like hand wrote it on

6
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,339
it and thanked it after her cracked her

7
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:33,890
up this is what we do in our free time

8
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:36,350
they're men men they should be excited

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,878
for dynamic delivery they're not they're

10
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,429
not Mad Men they still at that

11
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:43,070
Emeryville lace they sold a license to

12
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:44,210
Mad Men but they're separate independent

13
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,799
license operation but they weren't using

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,308
it it's not like it was an operational

15
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:52,159
license they applied for with the

16
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:56,839
advocacy that BPG is known for with the

17
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:59,209
city and then got bad men not hey look

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,149
both can direct subscribers no hate from

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:07,969
me right but she provides a different

20
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:10,159
service and I do but for that red box

21
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:12,259
competition up north oh they're coming

22
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,600
anyway they're all over it it's coming

23
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:17,959
it's gonna happen with or without

24
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:20,000
objection yeah I would love to know and

25
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,578
this is a great question Mad Men can

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,769
answer for me there is no Beverly Hills

27
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:27,199
store location right we want to talk

28
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:31,368
about Department of Consumer Affairs and

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,649
not confusing consumers I can't this is

30
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:35,868
a great question Beverly Hills has a

31
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:39,228
band right correct correct

32
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:41,269
so when you say my store location is in

33
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:42,859
Beverly Hills with a permit issued by

34
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:46,390
the city of Los Angeles

35
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:48,468
would that be confusing to the consumer

36
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,030
it's interesting so there's Beverly

37
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:51,649
Hills post office so I have some friends

38
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,700
that live in Beverly Hills as far as

39
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:54,649
their mail is concerned but they're an

40
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,728
unincorporated LA County and there's

41
00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:00,409
lots of pockets of it so I mean sure but

42
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't think the confusion to the

43
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,680
consumer about what city they're

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,840
purchasing their cannabis in matters so

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,189
long as it's a compliant store if you're

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,140
telling them they're buying one thing

47
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:10,849
and giving them something else but the

48
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,039
BCC is more confused of somebody being

49
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:16,829
confused that the bottle of infused

50
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:21,568
fruity liquid is as being marketed as

51
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,819
wine as opposed to as opposed to their

52
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,318
concern with them seeing their stores in

53
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:27,060
Beverly Hills when technically they're

54
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,250
probably Beverly Hills post office and

55
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,050
it's unincorporated County they can't be

56
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,560
incorporated LA County they have a City

57
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,989
of LA permit then it's a piece of LA the

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,420
city that pokes into Beverly Hills and

59
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:47,099
uses their post office or whatever they

60
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:52,289
want to call their market or first and

61
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:53,789
foremost that is true marketing I mean

62
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:56,579
that's why they all serve a dispensary

63
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,109
on 4th Ave it's not because that's the

64
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,880
most profitable location it makes a

65
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,319
statement and there are companies that

66
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,909
are going to go with the lake let's go

67
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:04,109
slow and roll into it and there's

68
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,030
companies like them that are gonna go

69
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,060
big and loud and different different

70
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:13,409
business plans see how that develops

71
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,909
right when the American money comes into

72
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:18,299
the American market

73
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,669
I am excited for the SEC filing

74
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:25,739
discussion but they're not traded on the

75
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:29,879
US so they know that American money

76
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:32,259
comes maybe shoes ok change absolutely

77
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,159
without a question

78
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:35,120
