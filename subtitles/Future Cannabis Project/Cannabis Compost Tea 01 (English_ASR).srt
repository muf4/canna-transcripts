00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:15,509
Matt you've got your favorite toy here

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,179
that you love like a child and why don't

4
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:25,018
you tell us a little bit about what you

5
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:27,990
utilize the vortex ruler for well I use

6
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,448
I use this particular on the this is a

7
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:32,479
vortex and other companies make similar

8
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,030
versions of this it's all based on

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:40,140
cyclone type of motion for the water so

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,140
that the key to how many organisms you

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,609
can bring to life and support in a

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,009
liquid environment that they might not

13
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:49,829
necessarily prefer is based on dissolved

14
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:52,799
oxygen so for this particular size using

15
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,350
a small machine like this this is the

16
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:58,468
one that I personally have just through

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,480
my own trial and error I've found is is

18
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,770
the most effective the cyclone action

19
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,750
will hold the largest amount of

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,299
dissolved oxygen which allows me to do a

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,969
little bit more concentrated peas in

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,480
this then you know say your five gallon

23
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,420
bucket with an air stone which works

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,270
- how many life forms can you support

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,540
and the number of gallons you might have

26
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:21,259
and then especially when we're doing

27
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,750
treatments where a lot of this stuff

28
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,120
diluted quite a bit that means you know

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,060
this 30 gallons might actually be able

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,710
to spray 300 gallons that we're using a

31
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,329
ten percent dilution whereas if you use

32
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:34,729
a 5 gallon buckets that 10 percent

33
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:37,780
dilution really wouldn't contain enough

34
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:43,250
microorganisms to make it that effective

35
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:48,109
cycle these deficiency ugly early so

36
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:50,569
what type of teas would you be making in

37
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:53,120
there to build organisms for like what

38
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,339
are some your top situations that you

39
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:00,439
would want to multiply organisms to grow

40
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:03,890
life it really depends on what we're

41
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,870
trying to accomplish so the first

42
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,060
challenge is starting with like taking a

43
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,409
clone and putting it into soil the first

44
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,360
challenge you have is that most

45
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:13,490
commercially bagged mixes even if they

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,130
are an organic base and motion part most

47
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:19,400
of them are based on sterile media so

48
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:21,919
that would be Moss Coco there's really

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,560
not much in them they hold moisture very

50
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:28,209
well they have they have the right

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,920
they say they hold the right combination

52
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,590
of moisture and they dry out allow

53
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:36,039
oxygen giving your soil breathability

54
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:39,189
and oxygen to the roots is important for

55
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:41,679
all plants are most limited bog plants

56
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:45,669
important Bush for us for Canada that's

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,830
really important so for starting out

58
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:52,119
with mixes that are commercially blended

59
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:54,550
which is really ideal it is in a

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,430
backyard we've got pure rich beautiful

61
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,930
compost that we've made ourselves and

62
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,629
it's got a complete ecosystem in it but

63
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:05,590
that's not realistic for a commercial

64
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:07,240
scale what we end up with is even if

65
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,750
they are organic based they were quick

66
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,490
batched

67
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,240
which means if you were to take out say

68
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,770
a wood particle in an organic based

69
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,360
organic based soil blend and you snap a

70
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,680
little piece of that wood in half what

71
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,270
you'll see is that the outside of the

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,640
wood looks dark and broken-down the

73
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,990
inside of the wood is are off because

74
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,219
they're quick batch they're doing it as

75
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,469
fast as possible to pump out the

76
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:30,580
material so a lot of those things don't

77
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:32,680
have like an established ecosystem in

78
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:37,269
the soil

79
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:40,269
and that is just like our our gut our

80
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:41,829
digestion and many people would say a

81
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,480
lot of our immune system exists in our

82
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:47,010
gut it's the same thing for the plants

83
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:49,389
in that in the soil with their roots

84
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,519
going out into that soil that is their

85
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:54,399
digestive tract that's their that's

86
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,280
their resistance to diseases that their

87
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,629
vitality that their nutrients how fast

88
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,628
how hard how babies are going to grow

89
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,719
your kid raised in Iowa meat and

90
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,399
potatoes and corn versus your kid raised

91
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,009
on McDonald's is going to have different

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,490
rates and and health characteristics of

93
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:16,050
those two things so the the the brewer

94
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,810
is a great tool for being able to

95
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:22,530
introduce whatever microorganisms might

96
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,480
be lacking in the soil so for something

97
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:27,779
like taking the an original kind of a

98
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,670
relatively sterile mix that just came

99
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,469
out of a composting or just came out of

100
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,650
some covert purification process or

101
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,450
industrial process cursing a lot of

102
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:39,419
times introducing like an entire

103
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:41,969
ecosystem into that soil including all

104
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,620
kinds of different organisms and those

105
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,180
organisms all have all kinds of

106
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,680
different roles that they know that they

107
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,829
play in many of them all played

108
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,259
different roles they will break down

109
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:56,199
nutrients they will

110
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,519
create all kinds of antagonistic enzymes

111
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,310
for pathogens

112
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,740
some of them will attack pathogens or

113
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:07,530
will attack molds and all these funguses

114
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:11,439
and others will create basically either

115
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:14,199
as a product of their life their

116
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:17,170
lifecycle they will actually create

117
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:20,560
enzymes that are like a pellet

118
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:23,230
penicillin for the soil competing with

119
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,319
other organisms a lot of them produce

120
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:29,439
growth hormones so they actually will

121
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,849
have a direct relationship with the

122
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,670
plant where they're saying to the plant

123
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,260
I want more of what you're providing

124
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:38,930
which in a lot of cases this glucose or

125
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:40,788
just living space

126
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:44,900
they colonize the roofs they want more

127
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:47,120
area to colonize as they as they as the

128
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,709
population increases so what table does

129
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,180
they'll create a side effect of there'll

130
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:52,038
as part of part of their life cycle

131
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,870
they're actually creating growth

132
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:56,029
hormones that encourage the roots to

133
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:00,500
grow and that's ready to see a lot of

134
00:05:56,029 --> 00:06:01,849
the advertisements for for the binding

135
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,129
hydro stores you know they'll show you

136
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,750
pictures enhancers Rico competitive

137
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:07,250
that's what they're what they're doing

138
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,300
one of the modes of action how that

139
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,509
happened

140
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:15,199
so without I just have a question right

141
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:18,759
there is so essentially instead of

142
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:23,598
purchasing bottles of growth hormone or

143
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:26,150
enzymes or amino acids you can which are

144
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:28,159
all basically byproducts of biology

145
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:31,668
byproducts of fungus byproducts of

146
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,430
bacteria mainly you can grow that

147
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:36,620
bacteria and that fungal colony inside

148
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:40,069
of this so that you don't need to spend

149
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:43,009
that money on things in a bottle at the

150
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:47,000
growth storehouse right and so then in

151
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:49,069
that one other nice thing I understand

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,199
about something like the vortex because

153
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:56,259
it allows you to create so much life in

154
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:59,389
such a small area what does it take

155
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:01,098
relative of compost to put in here so

156
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:02,720
for instance let me back up a step you

157
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:04,550
mentioned earlier that in our backyard

158
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,770
it's really easy for us to have a big

159
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,180
pile of compost right and we can use

160
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,469
that compost and we can clean it right

161
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,629
into that compost and it's full of

162
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,150
biology but in a scenario like this

163
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:16,728
where we have 1.2 acres and we have a

164
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:19,698
sterile medium going out and we need to

165
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:23,029
get that big bulk of compost in there

166
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:27,139
without needing the big bulk like how

167
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:29,489
much compost would it take to mock up a

168
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:33,340
batch of this

169
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:35,500
it kind of depends on I wanted there two

170
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:39,039
basic approaches to that one is

171
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:43,170
basically finding a large supply of pure

172
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:46,540
clean to explosively alive compost and

173
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:50,550
literally washing it with oxygenated

174
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:53,319
water and then the other approach is to

175
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:56,910
basically just looking at this more as a

176
00:07:53,319 --> 00:08:00,159
petri dish we introduce those organisms

177
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:03,550
they become in the form of a bit of a

178
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,380
dust is what it appears to be you're

179
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,889
introducing the microorganisms that you

180
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:10,480
want selectively picking speed species

181
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,699
and then you're basically giving them

182
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,420
the foods that they would put the food

183
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:19,689
required and the oxygen for their

184
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,189
population to not only to wake up from

185
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:23,019
the dormant state that you purchase it

186
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:24,550
in if you're you know buying that at a

187
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:27,310
hydro store you're already not for a

188
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,449
scientific supplied type of place you're

189
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,670
sticking it in there basically with a

190
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,370
food supply and oxygen and causing that

191
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:37,240
population to grow in here without

192
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:40,419
actually using compost excell are the

193
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,430
two basic approaches so with with like

194
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:46,319
rinsing of compost

195
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:48,839
Manit the more the better as long as

196
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,760
you're as long as your oxygen levels are

197
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,910
high enough to to keep all that stuff

198
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:58,559
alive and your your your dissolved that

199
00:08:53,909 --> 00:09:00,839
your your ppm s are low enough that's

200
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,779
what that would essentially equate to

201
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,550
the same amount of compost you would

202
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,319
need mountains of compost if we were

203
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:09,479
just washing that compost and just

204
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,730
pulling off what's there temporarily

205
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,500
keeping it alive and then feeding it in

206
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,710
a liquid solution you still need a lot

207
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,860
of compost to do that versus not

208
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,780
commercially feasible yeah versus where

209
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,340
you grow you'd actually grow a life and

210
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:26,009
this and multiply life in this by

211
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,769
something as simple as a powder you can

212
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:32,490
drop in here with some glucose be it a

213
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:35,850
molasses in there and that will multiply

214
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,200
that and you'll get I mean in this

215
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,720
thirty gallons it would be

216
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,280
representative of like a mountain of

217
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,320
conference somewhat like yards of

218
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,199
compost as far as the amount of biology

219
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,510
that this can contain from from my own

220
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,640
experiments and there I'm not a

221
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:52,360
biologist I'm not a trained patch it's

222
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,799
of my experience

223
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,180
experiments are probably pretty

224
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:59,500
rudimentary compared to what they would

225
00:09:55,179 --> 00:10:03,629
do but in my experience you are able to

226
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,589
produce five to twenty times as much

227
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:08,860
like when you look at that under a

228
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:11,220
microscope the your looking at how many

229
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,659
you know hundreds or thousands of

230
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,250
organisms are able to identify in one

231
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:17,799
field of view based on whatever

232
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:20,350
magnification you're using and you will

233
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:22,088
find that the rates of doing it that way

234
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:25,500
are much much higher than they are in

235
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:29,740
compost but compost is the more diverse

236
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:32,828
biology in a lot of cases the what we're

237
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:35,320
dependent on without other the limiting

238
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:37,088
factor I should say of the other method

239
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,230
is that a lot of those organisms are not

240
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:43,269
able to be put in a suspended state that

241
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,550
is then able to be put in a bag and

242
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:47,919
sealed without oxygen and put on a shelf

243
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:50,379
and transported by truck and that at a

244
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:53,139
time and sold so there's a lot of

245
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:56,409
organisms that just won't take that that

246
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:58,990
they will live and propagate readily in

247
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:01,929
soil so I think a combination of the two

248
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,240
is kind of the ideal if you're if you're

249
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:05,469
doing both of them in combination with

250
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,930
each other so you're taking things like

251
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,029
worm castings and clean

252
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:11,949
organic compost really biologically rich

253
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:13,419
organic compost and washing that while

254
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,790
at the same time adding some of those

255
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:19,000
foods and then supplementing whatever

256
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:20,769
additional species you might want and a

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,769
little bit higher concentrations usually

258
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:27,250
a lot of those little ones that are are

259
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:31,329
antagonistic to the pathogens pests

260
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,529
diseases things like that but then it

261
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,810
can depend to me if you're if you're

262
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:37,419
trying to break down your soil faster

263
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:39,429
like you use what's in your organic

264
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:42,250
blend faster and there are certain

265
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:45,339
organisms that will increase the rate of

266
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,169
decay a lot of that stuff a lot of them

267
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,780
are what create the amino acids that

268
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:52,329
then make the minerals in the soil that

269
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,819
are insoluble able to be taken up by the

270
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:59,080
plant introduce things like green sand

271
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:00,370
and calcium clay montmorillonite all

272
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,490
those types of things that have like a

273
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,080
really concentrated minute but really

274
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,700
diverse concentrated mineral content

275
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,350
none of those minerals are able to be

276
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:13,480
readily absorbed by the plant amino

277
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:15,100
acids are what make those available so

278
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,170
picking and choosing the speeches that

279
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,320
you want that are going to that they

280
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:22,419
have a tendency to produce amino acids I

281
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,660
want to say this Stila sub course is one

282
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:24,659
of those

283
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:29,318
increasing things like that certain

284
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,789
times during the lifecycle so as we're

285
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:32,860
going into flowering and we want them to

286
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:34,659
be able to feed heavier than we might

287
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,829
add a combination of something that

288
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:38,620
would include a handful of pasilla

289
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:41,379
strains and possibly lactobacillus trans

290
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,669
as well there's able to survive pretty

291
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,198
adverse environments and they break down

292
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:46,990
things relatively fast and you'll

293
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:49,059
recognize those from from milk and

294
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,250
yogurt and if you look on the back of

295
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,869
the yogurt thing lack of vassilis

296
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,240
they're the same ones that exist in our

297
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:59,068
stone it can help us digest food so it

298
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:03,019
does the same thing for soil so maybe it

299
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:10,959
all depends on what you're trying to do

300
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:10,960
