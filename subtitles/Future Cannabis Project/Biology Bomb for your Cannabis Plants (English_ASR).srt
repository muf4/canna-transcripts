[Music]

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:11,880
all right what we have here is an

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,989
experimental part had some people

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,500
hitting me up talking about

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,980
sustainability and using things from you

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,879
know your area and so mine started

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:28,079
cooking it and we've got here a

8
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:35,039
cantaloupe and white bean biology bomb

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:37,109
basically soaked white beans and then I

10
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,670
boiled them then I let them sit for a

11
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,939
couple days until they just started to

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,160
give it slight tinge of funk and then I

13
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:47,909
did my regular avocado tactics on it

14
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:52,109
malted barley kelp

15
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:54,628
gypsum crab meal and just went in use

16
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:57,000
bio Foss and inoculated with Bokashi

17
00:00:54,628 --> 00:01:00,358
little maple syrup and what you have

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,789
here is an avocado tech pod sin avocado

19
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,859
we got the white beans in place even in

20
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:09,420
the structure and the cantaloupe is high

21
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:11,969
in potassium so yeah here we go gonna go

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,769
put these down and get on some

23
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:15,599
experimental stuff there's no reason why

24
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,048
you can't grow your own melons grow your

25
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,449
own gourds grow your own pumpkins and

26
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:22,979
use things that are as local as possible

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,118
to you like kelp that I harvested off

28
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:28,319
the beach

29
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,659
local Maine malt company Blue Ox shout

30
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,849
out to them and just trying to use

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,200
things that are as close as possible and

32
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,609
you could omit some ingredients and add

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,189
some extra ingredients depending on what

34
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:39,629
you need so mixed up a bunch of the

35
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:41,849
filling I even have a little bit extra

36
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,859
here because I did some extra beans and

37
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:45,780
I'm gonna add that into some old avocado

38
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:49,500
shells they already have up there for

39
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:53,340
some other plants but hey I couldn't be

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,920
accused of not being down with the

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,049
movement and so here we are come up with

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,210
some different ways for you to use the

43
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:04,439
avocado tech the biology bomb the fruit

44
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:07,119
drop theory and use it for your garden

45
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:10,659
so we're up here in the garden

46
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:14,340
and everything's in veg right now just

47
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:17,799
reaching the screen on both sides and

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:22,229
I've chosen the spot for the pod here

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:26,710
underneath this peach skunk not scuse me

50
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:29,349
it's a cassava which is a cantaloupe

51
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:33,400
Hays times Bruce Banner number three by

52
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:35,139
deadpan head short squat little wide

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,000
leaf drug cultivar whatever you want to

54
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:39,879
call it

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,550
indica this is the spot I have a trip

56
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:46,689
emitter right here not too close to the

57
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,490
stock but in the same realm I saw some

58
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:52,719
worms as I was placing it so this is a

59
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:54,909
good spot the drip emitter to the side

60
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,310
it will just cask out cascade down the

61
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,319
edge down below sort of umbrella down

62
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,000
keep everything boys another good sign

63
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,150
is there is a little fungal life here on

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,310
the top of the cantaloupe I can RDC a hi

65
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,640
boys but smiles they cased radio left

66
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,709
Samantha's crawling on the top here he's

67
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:14,769
saying what's going on but anyway I've

68
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:18,670
placed it this is the spot I like to put

69
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,950
it underneath a hub of moisture and

70
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:22,629
underneath the plant if possible and

71
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:24,458
trust me the other plants in this bed

72
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:25,959
will benefit from this as well this is

73
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:28,840
gonna carry this on a lot longer than

74
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,209
just this this round even

75
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:37,689
great minerals in there that are not

76
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:40,680
even soluble as yet but other things in

77
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:43,049
here other than cannabis are

78
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,718
hustle cherry or the Cape gooseberry

79
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:49,049
down and and that we have minuet and

80
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:52,530
herb or aka herb Estella which is an

81
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,730
edible green has a little salty kind of

82
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,620
aspect to it it's great

83
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:58,500
probably sequester sodium in your system

84
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:02,129
and then I have some wheatgrass as well

85
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,870
as bush beans yellow bush beans and I

86
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:08,158
didn't see some dill popping up here now

87
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,509
it's interesting yeah I toss seeds that

88
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,489
I think will be beneficial willy-nilly

89
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:15,628
in here when the system kind of accepts

90
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,879
them wet them it sprouts them it's on

91
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:22,860
them not me so everything's looking

92
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:26,430
great man and I'll check into nan this

93
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:30,360
couple days three to five days we'll

94
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:34,910
check in peace I'm back it's been five

95
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,860
days and got some great growth in here

96
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,539
everything is really jumping up to meet

97
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,620
the screen some of its exceeded the

98
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:46,228
screen but I wanted to check on the

99
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:49,069
attack here I'm not gonna flip a pod

100
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:49,069
today only because

101
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:02,230
besides of fungal hyphae spreading out

102
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:03,459
all over the place around the bottom

103
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,800
edge I don't know if you remember but I

104
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:09,310
believe they discovered penicillin on

105
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,980
cantaloupes again there's definitely a

106
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,850
lot of

107
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,850
tivity going on here

108
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,280
so yeah I'm not gonna disturb it I'm

109
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:22,229
sure that there's a lot going on under

110
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,000
here right now but I'm gonna wait until

111
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:29,098
that 10 day mark to really give you guys

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,069
a view into what's gone on since I put

113
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:35,628
the pot down but definitely a great sign

114
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,629
to see all of this

115
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:45,750
activity happening several different

116
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:49,589
strains it looks in various different

117
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:54,839
stages of decomposition but it is going

118
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:56,908
around the entire bottom and also

119
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,619
creeping up onto the cantaloupe itself

120
00:05:56,908 --> 00:06:01,408
one thing I haven't studied before is

121
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,139
how the shell of the cantaloupe or the

122
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:06,269
skin reacts over time so that will be

123
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,620
another one of my experiments here to

124
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:09,329
see if it holds together and holds that

125
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,810
humidity dome or if it just collapses

126
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:15,228
altogether but hopefully we have a lot

127
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,870
of worms on the underside working

128
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:22,680
working that a ammendment field goodness

129
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,168
of white bean as the primary base that I

130
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,819
put down so I'll keep you posted and

131
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:28,818
check back in with you in a few days

132
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,769
we're back

133
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:44,759
all right it's been ten days canapes

134
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:48,810
filled in very nicely throughout let's

135
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:51,990
continue plants he's doing really great

136
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:56,129
it's the time to check out the

137
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:59,060
cantaloupe tech it's been 10 days let's

138
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:59,060
get down in here it's

139
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:05,550
yeah

140
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,379
well I can easily say this is more

141
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,199
overtaking with the fungi on the surface

142
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:13,680
than anything else I've ever put down as

143
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:18,349
far as avocado goes so pretty excited

144
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:22,290
about that starting to get more of a

145
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:25,950
white food and sort of that blueish

146
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,210
Trichoderma so take a look let's get

147
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:31,949
under here and see what's going on this

148
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:33,299
is literally cemented to the pod I'm

149
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:36,240
just going to remove this family for any

150
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:39,379
Erica's getting in the way a couple of

151
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,379
these families actually

152
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:49,379
let's dill springing up next door

153
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:49,379
let's give this thing a left

154
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:56,709
I would imagine there's still quite a

155
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:59,549
bit of filling left because of the sheer

156
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:03,959
density of the filler

157
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:07,550
it's pulling away but look at that

158
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,549
I couldn't even get underneath it

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,629
the flash on the inside so it is

160
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,779
sticking a little bit still a fair

161
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:20,490
amount of filling left but a awesome

162
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:23,609
fungal blue

163
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,350
on the inside here of course you can see

164
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,439
worms writhing around on the bottom

165
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,780
couldn't get underneath you know what I

166
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,070
can see movement under there I don't

167
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:33,299
even want to move it I don't want to

168
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,220
break any into fungal bonds that are

169
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,479
there but we have awesome amount of

170
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,610
worms that have moved in there I can

171
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:43,759
tell I can see from a distance you can

172
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:45,889
also see micro life is teeming

173
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:50,069
straighter lips

174
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:51,600
shemitahs hanging out on top where the

175
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,010
fungi go as they tend to go and I think

176
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,519
that probably means feed for them

177
00:08:53,009 --> 00:09:01,169
whether it be bold lights or those

178
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:03,569
little red orbited mites yeah everything

179
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:06,029
just looks great the feed is going down

180
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,850
it's been 10 days again roughly twice

181
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:10,259
twice as much feed in the pod so I would

182
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,570
imagine I'll take twice as long to

183
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:15,179
decompose there's one handy thing about

184
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:21,570
your avocados it just seems to be the

185
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:23,279
right size this is a jumbo pod which is

186
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,070
fine you know what this is going to be

187
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,129
for is a pre flower and going into

188
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:33,080
flower so I'm still in veg I'm probably

189
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:35,399
gonna give it maybe one more week to

190
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,050
completely fill out some of these spots

191
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,049
and reach the screen

192
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:45,159
salmon's over here I've got a couple

193
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,629
little guys that are lagging behind for

194
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:48,850
whatever reason but

195
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:51,429
everything else is just looking ragin be

196
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,629
healthy and you can see my clover back

197
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:58,688
there's

198
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:58,688
you ever grown some heady indoor clover

199
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,099
good stuff

200
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,829
all right so that's what it is I think

201
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,750
we'll extend this out to a 15 and a 20

202
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:13,568
day check just to see what happens

203
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:16,149
eventually to this I would imagine that

204
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:18,278
over Tom's just gonna get to look like a

205
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:23,198
blown out tire and the fungi will

206
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:24,789
consume everything so thus far you know

207
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:26,769
there may be a little bit of an aerobic

208
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:29,110
activity going on there but it's it's

209
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:32,049
it's a non-issue I think you've got

210
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:34,240
enough competitive decomposition going

211
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:39,669
on that this is healthy for the system

212
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:42,879
and as you can see the cassava from dead

213
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:44,469
pan-pan degrees it likes it and so does

214
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,000
its counterpart right next door the

215
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,000
dirty Starbucks from so good seeds

216
00:10:49,929 --> 00:11:00,459
cheers everybody I'll check back I'm

217
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:05,230
back it's been about 15 days and we are

218
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:08,230
gonna take a look at the cantaloupe tech

219
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,269
aka the cantaloupe avocado touch I've

220
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:17,490
applied the same principles as I do the

221
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:17,490
avocado - I can't elope a little bit a

222
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:23,200
little bit more longer than something

223
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:24,700
that you can wildcraft yourself you can

224
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,120
definitely grow cantaloupes and many

225
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:31,900
excuse me climates melons per qubits

226
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,000
meaning everything of the cucumber melon

227
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,230
family by yourself so I just want to

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,929
highlight that that can be used for

229
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:43,690
avocado tech in place of the meat of the

230
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:46,599
avocado I opted for some white beans I

231
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,160
think I use great northern white bean so

232
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:55,209
let's take a look and see what's

233
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:58,419
happened Wow excuse me she'll even more

234
00:11:55,208 --> 00:12:01,509
overtaken by fungi I did reposition the

235
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:03,729
hose as the pod started to collapse so

236
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:06,639
it's literally cascading down over the

237
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,320
top which seems to be pulling up some

238
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,299
moisture which definitely is helping

239
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,528
with the fungal breakdown let's take a

240
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,778
look and see what we got under here

241
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:17,528
though again the filling may break away

242
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:21,278
from the pod it's just different than an

243
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:23,860
avocado but again families have come

244
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:27,778
into play and are in the way so I'm

245
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:33,449
going to tuck these that's a beautiful

246
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:36,028
large lower fans here don't need to

247
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:37,019
quite remove me yet although coming up I

248
00:12:36,028 --> 00:12:39,120
probably will do a nice little

249
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:43,019
defoliation as you can see down here in

250
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,089
the under and the underbrush you've got

251
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,919
some work to do I like to clean up all

252
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:49,319
the legs on all these plants and and

253
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:51,748
take all the foliage off up to the

254
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:54,019
screen here so as you can see I got a

255
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:57,509
lot to do here

256
00:12:54,019 --> 00:13:00,539
plants have risen to the occasion and

257
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:04,129
our crust in the screen this guy was a

258
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:06,568
really short broad leaf variety that

259
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:10,528
it's still taking some time to gain

260
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:12,838
stature but it's still wide and has a

261
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:14,509
lot of nodes so looking really good yeah

262
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,720
the moment we've been waiting for

263
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:17,720
drumroll please

264
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:42,519
millipedes red wigglers all kinds of

265
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:45,390
foam going on in there looking good

266
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,980
see if I can separate the two

267
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:53,350
mycelial mat just covering the feeling

268
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:56,200
at this point that those red orbited

269
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,200
mites they're chewing on things it's

270
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,330
free to left Simitis predatory mites

271
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:07,080
okay even see a partially blended beam

272
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:09,430
there the tough worm is going after and

273
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,129
this one to highlight you know one of

274
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:14,439
the uses reasons for using Bokashi is

275
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:17,139
that you know if you have a big pod like

276
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,510
this with a lot of filling and any air

277
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:23,049
in a rubix situation happens this can be

278
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:25,210
a means of breaking it down anyway there

279
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:27,969
it is in action I think this will be a

280
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:30,700
good 2025 day pod so you need a long

281
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,680
slow release pod this might be your

282
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,170
method cantaloupe and if you can produce

283
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:37,809
it yourself even more sustainable

284
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:40,439
regenerative and all the better alright

285
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:40,439
peace everybody
