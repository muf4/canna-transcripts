2
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,260
so my family's in conventional

3
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,390
agriculture and I spent and spent some

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,500
time in cannabis my family gave an

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,359
opportunity to treat the alfalfa fields

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,219
essentially so I found myself looking

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,649
for dragonfly Earth medicine products at

8
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,739
forever flowering and I talked to Eric

9
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,270
and and he just bluntly told me very

10
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,669
clearly he's like you should find this

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,290
Elaine lady and just go listen to what

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,660
she says and just go find that

13
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,159
information he said this lady speaks but

14
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:48,929
nobody really understands the depth of

15
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,639
what she's talking about it's like if

16
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,590
you really want a brew tea's don't

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,420
follow recipes on the internet go find

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,579
out how to use this microscope as a tool

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,250
he says if your family farms on the line

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,579
and this is serious do this one thing

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,558
and that was pretty fantastic advice you

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,090
know as far as opportunities even to

23
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,250
create a business now my wife and I do

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,000
it and so just that phone calls turned

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,019
into work no not as a job a career no I

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,140
was just trying to help out the family

27
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:17,459
farm and the family had kind of seen the

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,019
end of the chemical road and it was

29
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,139
getting more expensive and less prospero

30
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,459
land so I was familiar with teas and I

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,200
had determined that there was something

32
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:29,548
beneficial going on with dragonfly and

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,590
Rocky Mountain worm company and Eric

34
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,150
seemed to know both of them so I called

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,670
Erik trying to find some of the products

36
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,130
so I could just copy what I was seeing

37
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,290
what seemed to be working and I was

38
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:41,759
really overwhelmed with the process of a

39
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,229
productive recipe because now we're not

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,578
talking about fooling around the garden

41
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,099
we're talking about like a family farm

42
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:50,339
it's something you know is much deeper

43
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,929
going on there and so I just wanted to

44
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,600
find a concrete answer that I could feel

45
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,649
comfortable in rely on and so Eric said

46
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,759
if that's what you're looking for you

47
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,250
need to just go find this woman

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,080
so that's been a pretty dramatic career

49
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,390
change I just functionally wanted to

50
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,810
learn how to use the microscope as a

51
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,879
tool and and how to how to actually

52
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,300
create this thing this woman said this

53
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,609
disease pressures reduction you know all

54
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,640
these things how do you quantify that so

55
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,860
that I could repeat that and at that

56
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,929
time it was really difficult to get in

57
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,310
touch with that information and get in

58
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,960
connection with that information she

59
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,719
would do three and five day workshops

60
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,969
but that's like like that's like a

61
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,659
trifold brochure I mean this woman's

62
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:36,219
been doing this for 40 years and so you

63
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:39,099
know in the beginning it was like a

64
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:40,990
10-week online you could chat with her

65
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,939
on Sunday and watch some videos and I

66
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,760
like introduced it and then she came out

67
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:46,479
with the like 16 week module that was a

68
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,969
mind-blower

69
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,159
and back when I went through you had to

70
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:54,219
find her to learn the microscope you had

71
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:57,219
to do a 2 day 2 day intensive and so it

72
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:59,050
was really difficult to even learn the

73
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,639
skill to quantify that this lady was

74
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,800
even telling the truth you know it's

75
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,299
hard to get to where you could sit down

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,340
and learn how to use the microscope so

77
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,860
when I went through it I had to take a 2

78
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,270
day workshop and then find somebody that

79
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,100
knew how to use the microscope and so I

80
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,930
had to befriend somebody else that was

81
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:15,459
doing this microscope thing so we could

82
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,020
sit down for eight hours on a Sunday and

83
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:19,900
say this is what this organism is this

84
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,719
is what this organ is amazing and so now

85
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,580
now you can do an online class and you

86
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,370
learn to a deeper depth than I learned

87
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,489
two years ago and so I've had to

88
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,129
continually engage to increase my my

89
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,739
tolerances and to stay statistically

90
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:37,419
relevant with my math and so we do that

91
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,739
periodically and we all check each

92
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:41,199
other's math we all count the same

93
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:44,039
sample so we stay up on that but now

94
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,509
people are taking these videos and

95
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,250
working through what took me a year and

96
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:50,109
a half to be comfortable to say my math

97
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,400
is correct you know it took about a year

98
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,230
and a half of fooling with the

99
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,740
microscope to say my math is

100
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:58,219
statistically correct

101
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,840
and now you can take a 16-week class you

102
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:01,520
can take the microscope class and I'm

103
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,189
seeing these younger guys they're really

104
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,520
intelligent finding it in six months and

105
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:09,409
being good at it and so you know the

106
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,510
thing is evolving faster than I can even

107
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:13,280
watch and I'm just trying to be positive

108
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:16,599
and be proactive and be a part of that

109
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,738
movement and you know try to help people

110
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,720
become self-sufficient cuz that's what

111
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,789
this is all about and that's why this is

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,400
so fuck I mean this information has been

113
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:29,780
around for 40 years the basis of what I

114
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:32,299
built my program on is is a paper the

115
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:33,619
lane wrote in 1987 and the organism to

116
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,540
organism interactions and how those

117
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,500
affect plant growth on a biomass level

118
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,500
like the quantified

119
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:54,569
