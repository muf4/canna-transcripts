1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
bye

2
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:12,760
cannabis is ultimately a freedom of

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:15,250
choice issue you know and that that's so

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,219
relevant to our lives in so many ways

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:21,160
you know I mean I'm happy to see that

6
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:23,019
the country is finally grown up and the

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,730
supreme court is ruled in a way that if

8
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:26,559
two people love each other regardless of

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,130
their sex they can get married you know

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:34,329
that's that's a freedom of choice issue

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:36,878
and it's a it's an issue of you know

12
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:39,819
largely of how tolerant we want to be as

13
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:42,789
a society towards people who are doing

14
00:00:39,819 --> 00:00:44,889
things that don't harm other people so

15
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:47,978
you know cannabis fits into that

16
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:51,489
conversation you know gay marriage is

17
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:53,888
part of that discourse and then there's

18
00:00:51,488 --> 00:01:00,178
other ways of looking at the issues and

19
00:00:53,889 --> 00:01:03,030
how its kind of relevant to you know

20
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:06,010
society you know there was a case where

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,040
you know someone went through the

22
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,890
airport with ten thousand dollars on a

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,990
domestic flight and the TSA said that

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,120
that ten thousand dollars in cash

25
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:17,890
smelled like marijuana or the duffel bag

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,770
that it was in smelled like marijuana so

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,239
they seized that money from that guy and

28
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:23,949
civil asset forfeiture allows you to

29
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,560
take money from people without filing

30
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,840
any with without you know prosecuting

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:35,560
and even getting a conviction it's uh

32
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:37,540
it's a way for enforcement to fund

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,049
themselves you know it's policing for

34
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:45,270
profit and you know I think that's a

35
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,269
that's a big problem i think that trains

36
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:53,589
law enforcement to subconsciously

37
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:56,950
disrespect our citizenry by seeing them

38
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:59,380
as revenue streams and it actually sets

39
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,659
up the exact opposite scenario that

40
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:05,319
enforcement was intended to provide

41
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:07,479
right citizens aren't here to serve

42
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:10,750
enforcement enforcement's here to serve

43
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:13,718
the citizens but we set up this thing

44
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,998
where you know enforcement views the

45
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:18,310
average citizen is a revenue stream and

46
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:20,859
that's just fundamentally wrong

47
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,150
on so many levels you know and that

48
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,739
happens with you know seizures if

49
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,780
cannabis is involved that happens with

50
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:31,810
just getting pulled over and getting a

51
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:36,939
you know a seatbelt ticket or a tail

52
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:38,709
light being broken ticket is it creates

53
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:41,039
a fundamental problem about how

54
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,969
enforcement views the citizen and

55
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,879
consequently how the citizen views

56
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:48,699
enforcement and you know anyone with a

57
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,989
Facebook account at least on my facebook

58
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:54,969
feed it's just constantly filled with

59
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:59,170
you know disrespectful encounters

60
00:02:54,969 --> 00:03:04,780
amongst police and and citizens of all

61
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:07,149
colors and you know I think I want to

62
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,669
use the cannabis issue as a way to kind

63
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,939
of continue the conversation about

64
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:16,479
things that aren't necessarily directly

65
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:19,659
related to the cannabis issue you know

66
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:22,179
and I think that's what people are

67
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:27,759
starting to realize is being involved in

68
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:32,969
the cannabis industry it's almost one of

69
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:35,649
the most profound forms of social

70
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:37,870
entrepreneurial ISM currently you know

71
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,989
because yeah we definitely do feel that

72
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,299
we're having a we're changing the world

73
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,209
you know we're having a direct effect on

74
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:49,719
how people perceive cannabis and

75
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:52,269
tolerance and freedom of choice and the

76
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,280
concept of medicine and what we should

77
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:58,780
and shouldn't be able to to do with our

78
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,609
with our lives so so yeah it's clearly

79
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,370
I've devoted my life to this it's got a

80
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:05,370
lot of meaning to me you know
