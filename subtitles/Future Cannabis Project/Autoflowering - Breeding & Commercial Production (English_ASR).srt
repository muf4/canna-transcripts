1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:09,718
[Music]

2
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:12,509
what are you seeing as far as the

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:15,198
advantages for Auto flowers for folks

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,629
that are growing at a scaled level at

5
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:20,009
acreage size yeah and I would I would

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:24,329
say since this is gonna be on the

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,499
internet for ever is for posterity go

8
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,320
back and take a look if you're very

9
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:30,689
interested about geeking out on some of

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,210
the historical background on ruderalis

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,140
that's that the technical term for auto

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,390
flowering plants ruderalis is Latin for

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,579
derived from ruderal which is rubble

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,609
from the rubble these are plants that

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,979
can grow anywhere like they can grow

16
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:49,469
where it freezes they can grow through

17
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:53,309
frost they can grow in very very crazy

18
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,280
situations and actually finish the the

19
00:00:53,310 --> 00:01:00,240
trick at industrial scale is really

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,829
being able to get them in the ground at

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,409
the right time so whether that's a

22
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,000
direct seeding or transplanting before

23
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,710
the plant goes through stress there's

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,379
some underlying genetic mechanisms that

25
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:13,169
lead the plant to go directly into

26
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,629
flower when it senses a stressful

27
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,849
situation just to step back for a second

28
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:20,459
because of that posterity say take a

29
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:21,118
look for that geek out moment at Ernie

30
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,158
smalls

31
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,019
Ernie smalls as a Canadian researcher

32
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,179
who's been working on cannabis related

33
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:30,959
issues for the last 45 years

34
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:32,340
brilliant gentleman and he is the person

35
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,498
that was responsible for coming up for

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,090
the industrial hemp zero-point-three THC

37
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:37,259
rule and if you go back and look at his

38
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,670
earlier writings that was based on

39
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,228
taking a leaf off at the top at the

40
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,319
plant rather than testing the top eight

41
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:44,489
inches of flower at 0.3% hopefully

42
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,530
that's going to be incorporated into the

43
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:49,078
USDA rules to say move forward at the

44
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,899
farm bill but in 2018 he wrote a seminal

45
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,998
paper and I'm sure that this is going to

46
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,769
go down as one of those Testaments to

47
00:01:53,998 --> 00:02:00,298
auto flowering plants and in the long

48
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:02,009
term the the paper is about highlighting

49
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,159
the fact that these day-neutral auto

50
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,189
flowering plants represent really the

51
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,229
peak in human agriculture so in a lot of

52
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,329
other crops the reasons and rationales

53
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,819
that we have for expanding the total

54
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:18,540
productivity of each individual crop on

55
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:19,709
a per acre basis has come down to plant

56
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,259
breeders geneticists

57
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,140
over long periods of time being able to

58
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:28,530
make the plants more compact make them

59
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:30,149
more uniform and take wild types of

60
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,460
plants that tend to have seeds in

61
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,650
varying places on the plant and

62
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:39,960
consolidate them into a usable machine

63
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:43,110
harvestable really energy dense organism

64
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,659
and that's been a true for many of the

65
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,830
other crops that have been domesticated

66
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:48,840
Ernie smalls goes so far as to say that

67
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,090
that is the most profound thing that we

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,670
have seen in over 13,000 years of human

69
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,520
agriculture is this move towards he

70
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:59,399
called some semi dwarf or dwarf germ

71
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,800
plasm so the title of the paper is dwarf

72
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,409
germ plasm and essentially it's about

73
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,330
how to get tremendously large yields

74
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,370
both for food crops if you're growing

75
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,740
for seed hopefully in places where

76
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,930
they're not growing for sensimilla or a

77
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:17,129
cannabinoid products we'll get into that

78
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,780
later but also for cannabinoid

79
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,159
production in general so it's it's all

80
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,270
about being able to maximize the space

81
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,250
minimize the inputs and really allow

82
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,189
both farmers and people who benefit from

83
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,349
these compounds to have more access to

84
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:34,620
them and and to benefit from this plan

85
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:37,139
and auto flowering plants are tremendous

86
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,819
at this maybe we don't know explain so

87
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:40,619
these plants if you if you're not

88
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,459
familiar with Auto flowers two things

89
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:47,310
first of all they'll start to flower in

90
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,980
eighteen days up to three weeks they'll

91
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,229
just flower period which is pretty

92
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,119
incredible which is pretty incredible

93
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:59,969
and then the the the other thing about

94
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:04,080
them is that they that you can you can

95
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:06,810
you can overdo it with them this is a

96
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,430
plant that grew quickly they were

97
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,750
discovered and and and about 1900 1903

98
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,840
scientists found him in the Volga River

99
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,509
area in Russia he described it it had

100
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,430
low low THC or no THC and so they

101
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,069
basically forgot about him and then in

102
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,019
the 70s people started to say hmm maybe

103
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:28,620
we could breed these and so you know the

104
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:30,509
breeding happened and then in 2003 a guy

105
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,620
was able to successfully commercialize

106
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:36,689
one called lowrider

107
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:39,100
and and you know these are the ultimate

108
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:40,569
heirloom kind of thing they're not a

109
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,430
land race really I don't think anymore

110
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:44,319
but they're their heirloom and you can

111
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,959
you can breed these things they go

112
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,360
flower and the you know 18-day third

113
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,370
third week by nine weeks they're

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,199
finished you harvest it Wow

115
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,030
the breeding potential and opportunities

116
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,789
on these things are just spectacular so

117
00:04:55,029 --> 00:05:00,489
so the opportunity to be able to improve

118
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,200
on this plant like we have in theory

119
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,050
improved on some of the some of our

120
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,889
agricultural plants is absolutely

121
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,540
incredible

122
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,269
another thing that I love about them is

123
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,550
that if you have got a greenhouse

124
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:15,490
environment but you don't you really

125
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:18,160
want to supplement with light for for

126
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,220
whatever reason you can actually do two

127
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,110
cycles of Otto flowers without light

128
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,390
depth and that's crazy right

129
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,060
no I'm experimenting with that this year

130
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:29,110
and the biggest thing I ran into was

131
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,879
trying to keep them warm

132
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,310
because Otto flowers don't particularly

133
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,310
like to start off their life with cold

134
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,829
feet but the idea is you know you can

135
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,230
you can have your you can you can start

136
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:45,219
something early spring and have it

137
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:47,890
finish 4th of July and then put put

138
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,750
seeds in that same no-till environment

139
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,009
let those pop and they're done by

140
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,550
October 1st

141
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:56,649
so you've run two cycles and and and you

142
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,379
don't have to pull any tarfu which we

143
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:00,579
all love to avoid right and so um so

144
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:02,740
that's fantastic and the other thing I

145
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:04,659
wanted to hit on was it was how

146
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,670
appropriate these are for patients and

147
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,760
for people with lower mobility because

148
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,080
like Jeff mentioned these are very

149
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,789
compact plants right he's pretty much

150
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,669
top out at around three three and a half

151
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:17,140
feet and and because of that you don't

152
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,990
have to do the reaching and they're not

153
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,629
hard to break down and and you know the

154
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,639
patient can stand up and look all around

155
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:26,230
them for mold instead of you know trying

156
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,089
to work with some of these nine footers

157
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,740
where they're just impossible to work

158
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:31,779
with they're beautiful and I love them

159
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,949
and I want to talk them right but but

160
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:34,719
they're really they're you know they're

161
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,209
all caged and difficult to work with so

162
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,920
this is something that that folks who

163
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:41,109
are living in an apartment who are

164
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,910
growing in a tent can grow for these

165
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,439
together with no sweat you don't even

166
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,209
need to scrub them

167
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,749
and and then if you're a patient they're

168
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:51,908
so easily it's easy to use and always

169
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:53,709
going to flower in a particular

170
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:55,808
timeframe you'd be ready to go that

171
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:57,038
really opens up the door but let's not

172
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:58,929
leave the impression that these are

173
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,399
little teeny baby flowers because their

174
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:02,168
little teeny plants you know I mean

175
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,478
there there's there's a there are some

176
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:09,188
I've seen colors that are 80 grams Wow

177
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:12,188
unbelievable and they'll have you know

178
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:15,218
10 of these colas on a plant so so these

179
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:18,489
are not the the lowrider that you

180
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:22,178
remember these are a totally new plant

181
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:25,598
ready for primetime just to add on to

182
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:27,248
that so yes you can make them flower in

183
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:29,079
general for field production we're

184
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:31,499
looking at about 77 days from the time

185
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,848
that the seed emerges in a starter plug

186
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:36,939
transplanted into the field within the

187
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:38,949
week 77 days from that time of emergence

188
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:40,569
until we harvest it and what Jeff is

189
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:44,588
saying is absolutely true what we see

190
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:46,179
with regular photo period plants is the

191
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:47,678
stem in stock weight accounts for about

192
00:07:46,178 --> 00:07:49,688
27 and a half percent of the total

193
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:51,698
biomass of the plants with these

194
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:53,709
day-neutral plants you're looking at

195
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,019
roughly nineteen percent so this is a

196
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:59,079
order of you talking about a significant

197
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:00,879
percentage of increased biomass now the

198
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,788
one thing that I will say and it's it's

199
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,838
a little bit of a little bit of a brain

200
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:10,838
bubble is try growing one of these in a

201
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:13,149
hundred gallon smart pot okay so it's

202
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:14,588
really nice for patients or someone

203
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:15,668
who's just trying to experiment with one

204
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:17,499
of these plants in the three gallon

205
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:19,478
container to have it on their deck it's

206
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:21,819
amazing it's really cool the very useful

207
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:24,128
plants they stay small they're not gonna

208
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,149
flip out if you'd hit them with a porch

209
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,399
light in the middle of the night when

210
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:29,110
you go outside but if you put one in a

211
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:31,959
much bigger container you're gonna

212
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:34,329
notice that the flowering system is

213
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:36,188
genetically determined based on stress

214
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:39,068
and stress particularly to the root zone

215
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:41,438
so you can actually grow five six seven

216
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:44,469
eight nine foot tall auto flowering

217
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:46,208
plants if they have enough root space

218
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,009
and they're not restricted they're

219
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,388
actually when we think about cannabis

220
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:51,129
one of the things that researchers

221
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:53,019
always go back to is the amazing

222
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:55,180
plasticity of that plant and its ability

223
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:57,159
to respond to the environment that it's

224
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:57,799
placed in Auto flowering plants the

225
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,039
stain

226
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:02,659
are to me it's the epitome of that all

227
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,949
right so so I don't know I'm gonna pull

228
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:05,299
together something Jeff just said and

229
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,670
something you just said and take it

230
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:09,969
further so Jeff loves to talk about how

231
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:12,679
these scrappy little plants from Russia

232
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,690
you know you can put them in in in Rocky

233
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:17,149
crappy soil and they still very much

234
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,399
thrive and and you have spoken to me

235
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:22,759
before just like you just did to all of

236
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,769
us that that thus it's the stress of the

237
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,539
of the roots hitting the bottom of the

238
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,459
pot that's going to trigger flowering

239
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:30,980
and but I've never heard you give this

240
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:33,708
example before of these large hundred

241
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,360
gallon pots which makes me very

242
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,699
interested in growing an 8 foot Otto

243
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,680
flower just to do it right so here's my

244
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:44,060
question is that if if if how do how do

245
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:46,338
they grow in soil then cuz like I know

246
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:49,250
you go right into the ground but there's

247
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:50,779
no eventual bottom of the pot so there

248
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,049
has got to be something going on

249
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:56,450
scientifically genetic so what's the

250
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:58,639
trigger yeah in part and one of the

251
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,320
things when you're there are many many

252
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,208
different soil conditions in the

253
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,620
Willamette Valley were blessed with a

254
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,449
number of things including and we'll get

255
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,700
into this as we talk about farming at

256
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,770
scale but we have in certain locations

257
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,680
38 feet of topsoil and if it's properly

258
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:14,509
prepared you can end up with very large

259
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,699
plants and we had plants that were

260
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:20,120
averaging a pound and a half per per

261
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,040
plant planted very densely in in the

262
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,528
field just north of Corvallis last

263
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,179
summer for one of our indie trials it

264
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:28,100
really comes down to proper soil

265
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:30,109
preparation and the ability for those

266
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,750
roots to just go out and do their thing

267
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,000
when we look at different plants from a

268
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,559
breeding perspective what we're really

269
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,690
trying to do is we need photo period

270
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,099
plants for very particular locations we

271
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,420
need plants are gonna flower early but

272
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,370
they're still photo period sensitive and

273
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:45,349
we need auto flowering plants so that

274
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,778
you can deploy these these plants in

275
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,790
basically once you've developed a

276
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:51,259
particular chemo var you can deploy them

277
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:52,969
anywhere in the world and that's really

278
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:56,028
what makes these different compounds

279
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:58,670
available to people so having CBD

280
00:10:56,028 --> 00:11:00,708
varieties having CBG varieties CVC rich

281
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:04,639
plants more importantly now working on

282
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:07,009
CBD vc b GV and and cbcb along with

283
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,250
other other minor compounds that we

284
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:10,110
don't even know how to

285
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,240
to quantify and don't have reference

286
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,250
standards for all of those are

287
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,049
incredibly important and not just from a

288
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,509
from a from a patient perspective being

289
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:20,099
able to grow it at home and take care of

290
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:22,379
your own family or take care of yourself

291
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,149
through the joy of actually gardening a

292
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,980
plant or something emancipatory about

293
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:28,379
being able to do that I think everybody

294
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,149
feels that but being able to make sure

295
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:32,879
that those compounds are available at

296
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:35,250
scale at a price that individuals can

297
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,600
actually afford to treat themselves so

298
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,149
it's it's pretty important and these

299
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,090
plants make that possible one one good

300
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:44,340
example of that is being able to use the

301
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:47,340
plasticity of auto flowering plants for

302
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,600
a particular ecological niche so most

303
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,820
most people here are probably familiar

304
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,500
with how much grass seed the Willamette

305
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,000
Valley produces so well well I'm a

306
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,919
ballet so them to 95 percent of the

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,299
world's grass seed production we're able

308
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:01,559
to grow grass seed in the Willamette

309
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:03,329
Valley for better for worse due to the

310
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,769
climate the climate that we have so we

311
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,509
don't normally get rain in the

312
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:08,639
Willamette Valley through the middle of

313
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:10,799
July up until the middle of August we

314
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,449
have a month of generally speaking very

315
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,949
very dry conditions and it allows a

316
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,960
competitive advantage of grass seed

317
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,000
farmers who have good irrigation and

318
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,610
great soil to be able to grow this

319
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,559
particular crop cut it down field dry it

320
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,840
it sits in the field for five to seven

321
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,239
days and then it gets combine and picked

322
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,850
up no other place in the world has that

323
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,220
steady climate that allows for that

324
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:35,250
particularly even though you know most

325
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,680
people like food rather than lawns but

326
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,990
no one else is able to really do this we

327
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,689
can actually do the same thing and use

328
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,299
this Texas ecological advantage paired

329
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,590
with a technological and horticultural

330
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:49,169
advantage by using these auto flowering

331
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:52,320
plants to plant thousands of acres of

332
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:53,939
very rare and useful compounds that are

333
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,090
present in these plants after specific

334
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,220
breeding grow them out and dry them in a

335
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,450
way that doesn't require a huge drying

336
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,100
infrastructure that you would you would

337
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:05,580
have to have for other crops or in other

338
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,870
locations it's a it's a huge I think

339
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,129
it's a huge step forward in terms of

340
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,320
being able to make these compounds

341
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:12,600
available make them an everyday thing so

342
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,940
that you can literally walk into any

343
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,190
supermarket and find something that is

344
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,840
useful and targeting a particular malady

345
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,820
we just need to figure out exactly what

346
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,470
those come which is which yeah right on

347
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,170
I've got to follow up questions for you

348
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,850
the first one is is you know I hear from

349
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,679
a lot of folks when I wouldn't you know

350
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,360
I'd become kind of an evangelist for

351
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,128
Otto flowers because I'm so into them

352
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,169
but people people come up to me and

353
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:36,509
they're like like you know we don't want

354
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:39,000
Otto flowers because we can't breed with

355
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:40,860
them and and they're they're not for

356
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,970
everybody and I want my nine-foot plants

357
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,709
and you already dispelled the night.the

358
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,959
short plants thing I didn't I did not

359
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:47,609
know they were a taller but um but I

360
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:50,938
like that you just said that there are

361
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,430
particular nature environments where you

362
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:56,818
want the photo period some that are

363
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:58,708
photo period but finish early and then

364
00:13:56,818 --> 00:14:00,479
there's the Otto flowers I've not heard

365
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:03,419
that analysis before so will you go a

366
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,120
little more in depth in there why do we

367
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:07,559
still need the other two categories we

368
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,799
don't it's just it's nice to have

369
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,958
diversity well we do we do need them I

370
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,068
mean we need them to breed with because

371
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:19,708
the land race strains our photo period

372
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:22,948
and so we need those so I mean we need

373
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:25,649
them good example is when we're this is

374
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:27,088
something that a lot of us living in in

375
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:28,289
a black market it was difficult to be

376
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:30,540
able to get information about the way

377
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:31,948
that people produce in other areas of

378
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:34,318
the country or other areas of the world

379
00:14:31,948 --> 00:14:36,088
a great example is Kentucky and

380
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:38,490
Tennessee so Kentucky and Tennessee have

381
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:41,130
incredibly wet July August and September

382
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,810
and then they have the very into

383
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:44,549
September and then through October they

384
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:46,948
have perfect weather and it's it's

385
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:48,719
almost like what Oregon is like in late

386
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:51,958
August early September before the rains

387
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,370
hit so it's most of us know here we need

388
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,028
to make sure that our plants are out of

389
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:59,850
the field taking care of harvested dried

390
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:01,470
properly handled it if it's not done by

391
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,019
the middle of September you're really

392
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,970
you're really pushing yourself you're

393
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,980
really chancing it in those areas it's

394
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,540
it's the opposite you want to actually

395
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,000
get your plants out at the end of

396
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:13,799
October so in that case a long season a

397
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:23,278
full season photo period sensitive plant

398
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:25,169
is really the way to go if you if you

399
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,360
have if you have an auto flowering plant

400
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:30,328
in certain areas you can plant your auto

401
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,970
flowers in early May go back and replant

402
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:34,500
in mid July and end up getting to crops

403
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,870
and and basically double the

404
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,360
productivity

405
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:41,570
of what you have available to you I will

406
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,210
say that they are a pain in the ass why

407
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:47,360
from a breeding perspective so we make

408
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,009
feminized seed we don't use males and if

409
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,560
you can come to me with a good argument

410
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:54,110
as to what is actually contained in the

411
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,939
male genome that's useful and how you

412
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,940
can access and figure out what those

413
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,370
traits are I'm open to having my mind

414
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,870
change that's what science is about but

415
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,250
the way that we operate is we make

416
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,379
feminized seed and we use females

417
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,059
because it allows us to know what the

418
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:09,950
chemo type is to know what the terpene

419
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:12,199
profiles are to know what the potency is

420
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,820
the flower structure and then be able to

421
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,830
figure out how that's inherited from

422
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,120
generation to generation auto flowering

423
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,980
plants are a different animal in the

424
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,070
sense that when you plant that seed that

425
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,080
clock is ticking you can't just go oh

426
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,028
hey that's a great plan well I'll just

427
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,100
revenge it and get some cuttings off of

428
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:30,019
it and use it for breeding it's done a

429
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,060
great example of this last year we were

430
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:34,250
I was working through had about 20

431
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:36,319
different CBG rich plants trying to

432
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,049
figure out what the the average ratio of

433
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,250
CBG to THC was to identify which plants

434
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:42,829
we could use or at least what the

435
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,769
frequency was for developing really

436
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,720
really high ratio plants and one of the

437
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,519
individuals from that population we sent

438
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,080
the the results into a third party lab

439
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,860
after we tried to screen them in-house

440
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,320
and they came back and said whoa

441
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,269
fifty percent of your total cannabinoid

442
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,970
profile was a compound that we've never

443
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,259
seen before it's not a terpene it looks

444
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,209
like a cannabinoid from its molecular

445
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:06,709
weight but we don't have any reference

446
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,259
to Enders to be able to identify what it

447
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,600
is and this is this is Pyxis in portland

448
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:14,420
they're a very good lab they have more

449
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,039
cannabinoids available to them than most

450
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,449
labs in the country and very good

451
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,328
equipment very well-trained personnel

452
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:23,000
and the person I was interacting with

453
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:25,490
said can you send me another sample and

454
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,640
I'm tearing my hair out saying that was

455
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:31,519
the only plant that was it it's gone

456
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,290
it's gone you can't get that back and so

457
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,629
you go back and grow hundreds of those

458
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:38,119
plants out and you never find that same

459
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,260
plant again so for a structured breeding

460
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:41,928
program when you're trying to isolate

461
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:44,809
these individual compounds and turn them

462
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:48,650
into useful field ready or home grower

463
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:49,519
ready seeds it poses a significant

464
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,230
challenge

465
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,379
because you only have a certain amount

466
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,940
of time we have literal professionals

467
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,400
now working at our company who are

468
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,590
trying to find other ways of making this

469
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,300
happen and it's this is a it's a

470
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:05,299
significant technological challenge so

471
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:07,759
there's ways around it but it takes a

472
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:09,859
ton of space a ton of time and a lot of

473
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,859
motivation to to really be able to

474
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:14,359
isolate them so just a they're a

475
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,500
different animal when it comes to the

476
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,779
breeding standpoint that's from a

477
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,480
professional perspective from you know

478
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:23,269
real amateur perspective if you take two

479
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,610
auto flowering plants and and breed them

480
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:27,650
together you can breed them ah and

481
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:30,139
they're fun there's nine weeks holy

482
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:32,440
crowing all of a sudden you know I don't

483
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,060
think I'll name this year for my wife

484
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,720
just like my big guys do you know what I

485
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:40,789
mean but it's really kind of fun and the

486
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,789
idea that you can get somebody's you

487
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:47,960
know genetics and now I could be careful

488
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:51,109
they talked about genetics yeah sorry

489
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,350
folks I joke here you know too soon too

490
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,479
soon

491
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:55,189
you know you get somebody's great

492
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,809
genetics he said yeah I wonder if I as

493
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,420
an amateur can I fool around with this

494
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:01,069
stuff a little bit you know these guys

495
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,720
obviously but you can you can fool

496
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:05,119
around with it and and you can do it all

497
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,100
winter long and you know under 20 hours

498
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:11,119
of light you can do it all night long if

499
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:14,059
I mean it's just this is a fun fun plant

500
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,349
to grow yeah it can be difficult and it

501
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:17,359
can cause some problems and if you're a

502
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:19,399
professional grower you got to adjust

503
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,869
yourself a little bit but boy if you are

504
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,240
a professional grower you're growing

505
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:25,909
medical cannabis get into these Auto

506
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,279
flowers see what you think see if we

507
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,500
can't improve the ability to get more

508
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:31,730
medicine out there and it it's it I

509
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,589
think it's a really important point to

510
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,700
you you brought up the historical

511
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,829
reference back to the low rider

512
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,390
varieties from 2003 that was a shitty

513
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:40,279
plan oh but the waters are worse

514
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,960
I grew some of that and it just made me

515
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,180
sick to smoke I mean it's horrible the

516
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,220
terpene profile was terrible the

517
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,049
structure was not great but you can see

518
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,990
the promise you could you could see the

519
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:52,849
promise and what it took was small-time

520
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,579
breeders who were working under either

521
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:57,349
medical programs or in their garage

522
00:19:54,579 --> 00:20:01,369
surreptitiously to improve those plants

523
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:02,629
and it wasn't until 2010 that I finally

524
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:04,129
consumed some

525
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,830
thing that changed my mind about auto

526
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:10,340
flowering plants someone had taken one

527
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:11,779
of DJ shorts blueberry varieties merci

528
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:15,049
and dominant with a number of different

529
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:17,569
minor terpene different Terp minor

530
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:20,629
terpenes that end up making it a very

531
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:22,460
calm anti-anxiety experience and it's

532
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,830
it's a beautiful piece of work but they

533
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,079
finally instilled that into an auto

534
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:30,139
flowering plant that made the effect and

535
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:31,220
the flavor just as good or better than a

536
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,650
lot of the other commercially available

537
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,569
varieties at the time and that was that

538
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,670
was the no you're right the early ones

539
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:39,139
the interesting but they weren't any

540
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,180
good and that's why you know I remember

541
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,120
I remember there's a listserv called

542
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:47,060
auto-flowering dotnet which we kid about

543
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,259
they they threw me off because I I got

544
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,539
on it and I say gee I'm writing this

545
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:52,730
book I need some pictures and they threw

546
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:56,539
me off I finally thanks this angle got

547
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:58,460
back on again and Ted has but but you

548
00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:00,230
know when they first started you would

549
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,940
be on grass city or one of those other

550
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,500
forms and you say oh I'm growing autumn

551
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,120
flowers people laughed at you they made

552
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,700
fun of the other you were stigmatizing

553
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,889
basically you were drummed out of the

554
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,019
community so somebody started the auto

555
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,670
for auto net you know and if you go back

556
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:16,660
at the way you know people were just

557
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:19,310
sort of struggling services and around

558
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,470
2008/9 somewhere right in that area they

559
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:23,059
hit the sweet spot you know and then

560
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,000
they started laughing at other people in

561
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:28,569
the pictures oh my god and on Instagram

562
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,339
just yesterday I saw one somebody had a

563
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:34,789
one of these movies where it went from

564
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:36,470
seed to harvest you know in two seconds

565
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:39,470

seeds for for my own home growing and to

570
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:53,720
help patients right because being able

571
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:55,730
to take males out of the mix if you're

572
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,400
not breeding them this is this is a win

573
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,710
but right now there are still lots of

574
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,540
auto flower seeds that are being sold

575
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,940
regs right so you're going to get boys

576

and girls and so you know if you if you

577
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,799
really if you just want the flowers and

578
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:11,869
you don't want to play with the plant as

579
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,779
Jeff is suggesting get yourself some

580
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:15,889
like fantastic modern you know feminized

581
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:17,509
seeds from like Mephisto

582
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,670
genetics or somebody who's got a good

583
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:22,039
reputation and it's all very plug and

584
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:25,009
play just like Jeff is describing but if

585
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:27,259
you want to enjoy that that extra

586
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,299
horticultural experience of making

587
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:32,150
something that did not exist in the

588
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:35,119
world until you did it you know find

589
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:37,220
yourself a pack of auto flour reg seeds

590
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,769
and pop a couple of them that you think

591
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:42,680
sound interesting and it's really easy

592
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:44,509
to collect male pollen you know you take

593
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,890
you take a branch and put it in a bag

594
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:47,599
and you shake it a little bit now you

595
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,280
got to back up on and you walk to the

596
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,230
other side or maybe your friend's house

597
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,609
and you've got a paintbrush and you put

598
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:55,009
some of that pollen on there and yeah

599
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:56,509
you paint it on to one branch of the

600
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:58,129
plant and then when you're done next

601
00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:00,319
year you're gonna have like you know 40

602
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,910
or 50 seeds and and like you said you

603
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,439
get to name it which can be the most fun

604
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,910
part but you don't have to wait till

605
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,200
next year that's the other thing I mean

606
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,080
you know these things grow indoors

607
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,420
really well you know in Anchorage we're

608
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:13,069
really excited about about the

609
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,890
opportunity to grow these things because

610
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:17,599
we got a photo period the same time we

611
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:22,550

612
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:24,649

flowers as you just heard from talking

614
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:29,210
about the low rider old kima bar you

615
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:31,339
know a lot of people nowadays still

616
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,470
consider them cute right but

617
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:35,839
professionals are like man you know this

618
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,210
is this is just something on the side

619
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,639
that isn't gonna you know matter to the

620
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,819
rest of us but then you know you meet

621
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,550
Seth and you you walk acre upon acre of

622
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:49,250
these beautiful plants in September and

623
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:51,109
the air is filled with terpenes and you

624
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,539
know you're just like oh my gosh I want

625
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:56,479
to lay up and lay up my content and just

626
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:58,839
like live here right and so um what I'd

627
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,220
like to hear from you both are you know

628
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:02,539
commercial applications right or and

629
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,539
specifically let's let's talk about

630
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:07,339
yield and quality because it's one thing

631
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:09,559
that it's all incredibly easy and we can

632
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:12,319
grow them intense but but a lot of

633
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:15,919
people are thinking about you know this

634
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:18,649
scale for commercial and also am I gonna

635
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,750
get enough flour for my effort for home

636
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,940
grow so so I'd like you both to kind of

637
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,890
speak to that option well here in Oregon

638
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,890
I mean I would start with new breed

639
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,250
seeds frankly they're in there you know

640
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,840
they're from Oregon they were

641
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:36,059
the first ones to get their license to

642
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:38,220
be able to sell seeds and and they are

643
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,809
growing for commercial growers I think

644
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,480
the last time I spoke to him they said

645
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:44,250
yeah you know the selling the seeds that

646
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,990
the dispensaries just a peon yes so they

647
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,400
want to go home and there are lots of

648
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,349
commercial growers that are using these

649
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,060
things for a couple of reasons all the

650
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:54,089
ones we've already discussed if you're

651
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:57,149
growing indoors on racks if you get the

652
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:58,529
right size plant double racks triple

653
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,480
racks you know you can use the whole

654
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:03,059
ceiling all the way up to the ceiling

655
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,500
the space on these things make it so

656
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:07,740
that you can inter space them in between

657
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,359
existing plants which is really a useful

658
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,859
thing to do you you know you've already

659
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,719
got the heat you've already got the

660
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:14,490
light if you're indoors and to be able

661
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,960
to interspace a little small plant

662
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,190
that's not going to detract from the

663
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,650
bigger plants that you're trying to grow

664
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,570
there's you know it doubles your ability

665
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,340
to get more income as a result of doing

666
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:24,359
this stuff so I so in that regard it's

667
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:26,339
important and then of course the idea

668
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:28,469
that you can get something in seven nine

669
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:31,109
you know if you want to go longer 12

670
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:34,170
weeks Wow I mean from a commercial

671
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:36,599
perspective if the yield is good and the

672
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,519
and and and the power is good if that's

673
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:40,169
the probably the terpene spectrum you

674
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:43,950
know you're there why would you want to

675
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:45,539
grow anything but so so I really highly

676
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,400
encourage you to try these they're

677
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:49,529
really quite something and to contact

678
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,780
you know people like new breeze season

679
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:54,629
and get names of other commercial

680
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:56,220
breeders that are doing it go see what

681
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,810
they're doing we all share information

682
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,850
that's what we do so oh I'm glad you

683
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:02,250
reminded me of that too before you

684
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:06,269
answer I want to plug with the correct

685
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:08,549
URL Auto flower dotnet yeah and cuz I is

686
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:10,200
a Jeff story with spot on right the

687
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:12,389
these were the people who were laughed

688
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,490
off of other forums for using Auto

689
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,800
flowers and so they decided to create

690
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,890
their own where they could be misfit

691
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,629
toys together and so you know one of the

692
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,610
things that we've lost in our scene I

693
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:26,160
think as people gotta have gotten more

694
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:27,899
money focus is everybody's got IP now

695
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,060
and everybody wants to hide and protect

696
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,220
things and you know back in the day

697
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,679
outside of just like not wanting to go

698
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,630
to jail people were really open to

699
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,570
sharing within the community sharing

700
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:41,130
best practices swapping seeds all this

701
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:42,990
kind of stuff which which you're seeing

702
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:45,690
less on the commercial side

703
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:51,450
you're still seeing on this group at

704
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:53,308
Auto flower net because they are they

705
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,490
are all trying to learn from each other

706
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:59,099
they are sharing best practices because

707
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:01,140
they haven't mattered for a while and it

708
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,329
really excites me to see some of the

709
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,009
leaders in that particular community

710
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:07,139
knowing what's good things are gonna be

711
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:10,230
like in three or four years when Auto

712
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:12,750
flowers just falls off people's lips so

713
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,759
easily and and these people will be the

714
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,009
new generation of superstars and and

715
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,319
that you know that's cool when when

716
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:21,539
people who I love an underdog story

717
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:24,210
right so so so say have some of the best

718
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:26,579
bud porn I have ever seen yeah the

719
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,500
photos are just incredible so so Seth

720
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:30,569
going back to you um specifically you

721
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,329
know the the people that you are sowing

722
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:37,558
seed to are growing at acreage size

723
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:39,029
right and and and when people are I mean

724
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:40,889
you don't have to give people pitches

725
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:42,839
about your seeds anymore but but just

726
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:45,030
for the sake of this conversation what

727
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,829
does that pitch sound like when they're

728
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:49,470
all like you know like really you want

729
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:50,789
me to you know plant a whole field of

730
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,679
these what are essentially still

731
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:54,329
probably gonna be smaller plants what's

732
00:27:52,679 --> 00:28:01,019
the name of the company give which one

733
00:27:54,329 --> 00:28:03,359
yours uh we don't advertise I owe you

734
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:05,490
like five emails so we like you know we

735
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,189
can't handle the advertising right now

736
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,259
honestly we we don't pitch it to people

737
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,970
people come to us and say hey I really

738
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:16,049
want to try this I really want to try

739
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:18,839
this and we say no you don't it's really

740
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:20,759
hard you're gonna fuck up you're not

741
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:22,319
gonna do it right it's taken us it took

742
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:24,500
us three years to figure out how to get

743
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,849
the plants in the field without having

744
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,859
flowering in trays and actually getting

745
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:31,259
a good yield this year we're moving on

746
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:33,928
to large-scale field trials for

747
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:35,069
different density of planting and we've

748
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:36,720
stepped back and we're actually putting

749
00:28:35,069 --> 00:28:38,220
it into the hands of much more competent

750
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,200
farmers who've been farming other crops

751
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,100
for their entire life and how many

752
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,500
cultivars that's such a technically how

753
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:49,039
many different kinds of plants roughly

754
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,039
one okay

755
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:56,019
not really yeah there's a number a

756
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:58,089
number of different varieties out there

757
00:28:56,019 --> 00:29:00,940
it all comes down for us it's not about

758
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:03,789
cultivars ours are chemo types we look

759
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,210
at plants as having very particular

760
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:07,960
chemical compounds that are replicable

761
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,600
generation after generation ship

762
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,890
corrected it's okay don't worry but it's

763
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,569
it really it comes down to trying to

764
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,340
figure out how you in the same way that

765
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:17,470
you're describing maximizing space in a

766
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:19,179
small area inside this is how do you

767
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:23,259
maximize the productivity on a per acre

768
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:25,029
basis over thousands of acres and it

769
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:27,220
really comes down to what we've seen

770
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:29,710
with successful farmers is either direct

771
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,610
seeding which is wrought with all kinds

772
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,529
of problems that most of you probably

773
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:34,509
don't care about but it all comes down

774
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:36,639
to the depth of the the planting of the

775
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:39,690
seed and you're talking about literally

776
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,830
millimeters will make or break success

777
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,840
down and then the other side of it is

778
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:46,839
the density of planting for both weed

779
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,209
suppression and to maximize lateral

780
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:51,039
minimize lateral branching and force the

781
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,799
plants to basically just turn into one

782
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,379
solid flower that's that's really what

783
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,509
we're looking at this year I and then I

784
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,310
would say for 2020 dad definitely will

785
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:04,569
be ready for you to buy autoflowering

786
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:08,829
seeds both type 3 CBD rich plants and

787
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:10,659
type 4 Pierce EBG lines so what are the

788
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:12,639
other advantages amines clearly the

789
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,460
short cycle is great for scaled

790
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,990
agriculture but when I visited your farm

791
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,309
you were mentioning some other things

792
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,160
like the fact that the plants are

793
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:24,069
uniform so they're really easy to repeat

794
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,150
cut on a sled cut on a slit so so what

795
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:28,000
are the what are the you know

796
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:31,269
traditional farming advantages of this

797
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,890
plant versus the photoperiod ones the

798
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:34,569
the main one in it again it's gonna

799
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,920
depend on your location in certain areas

800
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:37,990
you can't cut the plant down and let it

801
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,670
dry in the field and a lot of people

802
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,859
have had questions about that we did our

803
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,830
team did some amazing experiments this

804
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:47,619
last summer long hours in the field very

805
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:49,829
hot conditions harvesting about 15 acres

806
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:53,019
that believe it was about 38,000 plants

807
00:30:49,829 --> 00:30:55,689
in early August cutting him down laying

808
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:57,878
him down in the field to basically cook

809
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,850
at 100 degrees during the day

810
00:30:57,878 --> 00:31:03,488
and then grind him up and put him into

811
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:05,709
totes just to see how much CBD would be

812
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:07,808
lost and what the terpene loss was going

813
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,889
to be and what we found was about you're

814
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:11,408
gonna lose about two thirds of your

815
00:31:08,888 --> 00:31:13,569
terpenes they're very volatile they just

816
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:17,139
they vaporize they're gone but there's

817
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:20,200
still enough to be able to get some some

818
00:31:17,138 --> 00:31:21,519
efficacy from entourage effect depending

819
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,019
on the type of terpenes that you're

820
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,878
working with and their their volatility

821
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:27,028
the heavier sesqui terpenes tend to

822
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:28,959
stick around the the really volatile

823
00:31:27,028 --> 00:31:30,940
monoterpenes are always going to be gone

824
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,179
but the moral of the story on that was

825
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,889
that CBD content did not change there

826
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:37,989
was no statistical difference between

827
00:31:35,888 --> 00:31:39,219
plants that were cut down and dried in

828
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:42,190
the field versus plants that were cut

829
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,749
down and hung up in a warehouse so again

830
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,239
that's a that's a great thing if you

831
00:31:43,749 --> 00:31:48,608
happen to have a very dry late very dry

832
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:50,590
late July early August but if you have a

833
00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:52,509
rainy period that may not necessarily be

834
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:56,348
the plant that you want to use so it's

835
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:58,210
it's really about like any farming or

836
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:59,798
any any cannabis production it's about

837
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,869
being able to use the plasticity of the

838
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:04,898
plant to adapt to your own local

839
00:32:01,868 --> 00:32:06,308
ecosystem and climate sixty five to

840
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:09,158
seventy percent of them are mere scene

841
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:10,569
dominant so what we're seeing out I was

842
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:12,489
fun to walk through and take a look at

843
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:14,528
the the flowers that ran it for the

844
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:16,119
competition this year and see the

845
00:32:14,528 --> 00:32:17,950
different terpene profiles and watch the

846
00:32:16,118 --> 00:32:20,709
evolution of what growers and breeders

847
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,819
are targeting at this play go through

848
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,470
and count how many are mere scene

849
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:25,898
dominant this year compared to years

850
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,940
past versus Turpin alene dominant plants

851
00:32:25,898 --> 00:32:30,808
that's the it's a big thing it's your

852
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:33,460
your your fuel flavor your diesel flavor

853
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:35,378
Turpin a lean beta carry awfully and

854
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,450
alpha pining we're seeing that now

855
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:39,788
emerge in auto flowering plants as well

856
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,950
and it's a little bit more difficult

857
00:32:39,788 --> 00:32:43,419
with auto flowering plants just because

858
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,788
of the breeding that we were talking

859
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:47,889
about earlier but they definitely pack

860
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:50,169
all of the flavor and to be perfectly

861
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:53,019
honest the the potency as well out of

862
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:55,509
our type four high CBG varieties that

863
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:59,919
we've developed the individual plant

864
00:32:55,509 --> 00:33:02,470
that has far in a way had the highest

865
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,570
overall CBG percentage was an auto

866
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:09,339
flowering plant and it came in at almost

867
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:11,599
16% CBG was over 17% CB GA before addi

868
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:14,470
carbing it's it's definitely

869
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:18,288
able to create absolutely terpene rich

870
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:20,569
cannabinoid heavy and diverse chemo

871
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:22,369
types with with these day-neutral plants

872
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:23,899
and i know that you're having the

873
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:25,609
analytics and you test everything

874
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,350
in-house do their numbers come out

875
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:29,779
comparable to photosensitive plants as

876
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:31,819
well on average they tend to be a little

877
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:33,259
bit lower but it also depends on the way

878
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:34,849
that you treat them in the light

879
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:37,819
spectrum don't they also have a little

880
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:41,569
bit more CBD yeah you can change any of

881
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:43,460
those I mean from an amateur Rohr seems

882
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:46,759
to me that there there's always CBD in

883
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:48,919
my Auto flowers but but I'm not sure

884
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:52,339
there isn't my bigger plants I don't

885
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:55,669
know but yeah we haven't seen that cbc

886
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:56,928
there is a little bit more CBC there at

887
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:58,940
least there tends to be and that that

888
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:00,590
actually it depends on the varieties

889
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,880
that you're looking at but it is it is

890
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:03,678
definitely present amount of flowering

891
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,260
plants let's just spell another rumor

892
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,519
about taste I know that you spend a lot

893
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:10,280
of time breeding them and a lot of

894
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,440
people say okay so this is a cookies

895
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,810
Otto flower so essentially that means

896
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,510
that's cookies crossed with a ruderalis

897
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:20,320
plant and a lot of people say that Rudy

898
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,340
Rudy plants taste like crap right so so

899
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,320
what do you have to say about people

900
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,419
saying that there's all this like this

901
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,510
this ruderalis terpenes coming along for

902
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:31,908
the ride there used to be I think that

903
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:34,100
used to be a valid a valid valid

904
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:36,440
distinction one of the main things to

905
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:38,118
consider as well is normally what you're

906
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,220
trying to do in a breeding program is

907
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,230
look at the f2 so you take two parents

908
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:44,509
that are very divergent across them and

909
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,760
then do it either an open pollination or

910
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,429
a targeted selfing in the the f1

911
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,649
generation and then you have f2 plants

912
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:53,929
that exhibit every possible combination

913
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:55,608
or permutation that you can possibly

914
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:57,079
imagine it's where the most diversity is

915
00:34:55,608 --> 00:34:58,549
expressed if you're a plant breeder

916
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,440
that's where you should be looking for

917
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,150
amazing things if you have a specific

918
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,329
terpene profile that you're trying to

919
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:08,180
target you can't overlook that f1 cross

920
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:09,949
because that's that's actually where you

921
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:13,190
would identify the plants that have the

922
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:14,779
most similar profiles to whatever it is

923
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,760
that you're trying to target so yeah you

924
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,380
can we get very I won't say very easily

925
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,390
but you could take a

926
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,400
Jiji for a prostitue an auto flowering

927
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:25,279
plant and then do your initial selection

928
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,809
in that f1 inbreeding one more time and

929
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,180
you can you can lock those terpene

930
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:31,009
profiles in it obviously takes more time

931
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:33,199
for stabilization of traits and that

932
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:36,730
sort of thing but terpenes making it

933
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,730
taste good we can do

934
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:47,348
