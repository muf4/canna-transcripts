00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,709
[Music]

2
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,960
so today we're going to be speaking

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,118
about inclusion diversity and social

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,439
equity and what that comes in and how

5
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:31,559
that plays so I will now let my

6
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,549
panelists start the conversation yes it

7
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,439
right off the bat we're just gonna keep

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,259
this very laid-back we're gonna keep it

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,780
conversational you know this has been an

10
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:42,269
emerging topic you know that we've been

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,770
trying to take on you know at CCI a you

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,050
know I know LA has been trying to take

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,129
the song for social equity programs and

14
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,988
we just want to make sure it's a part of

15
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,878
the conversation I don't know if you

16
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:53,339
wanted to kind of talk about what's

17
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:59,099
going on in LA today so I get going

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:02,280
sure so I am very excited today August

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,260
1st at noon which is about less than 30

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,049
minutes away the city of Los Angeles

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,240
will begin to accept applications for

22
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:13,890
Phase two of our priority processing

23
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:16,469
this is a huge effort that the city is

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,719
undertaking specifically because prior

25
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,640
to the first of this year the city of

26
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,920
Los Angeles expressly prohibited

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,540
commercial cannabis activity and it's

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,689
really within the last two years that

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,100
the city of Los Angeles has begin to

30
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:30,929
consider and articulate what a

31
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,728
reasonable and responsible regulatory

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,430
framework would look like and I'm very

33
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:37,560
excited about it I know that with our

34
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,750
first phase of priority processing we

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,019
moved a bunch of our existing medical

36
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,780
Mara marijuana market our cannabis

37
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,118
market through but this is really a

38
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,560
whole new era for the city in this new

39
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,349
phase that's going to be launched

40
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,540
because one of our council members has

41
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:57,449
described the situation in the city of

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:02,130
Los Angeles is us having a cannabis

43
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:05,070
Immaculate Conception where historically

44
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:08,639
we knew and collected taxes from a bunch

45
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:11,189
of retailers but never had a real

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,929
understanding of the supply chain and I

47
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,740
think that that's very important for the

48
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,840
city and

49
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,700
and the this cities undertaking is going

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,569
to be very important for the state I

51
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:25,739
think that for better or for worse when

52
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:27,359
a lot of everyday Angelenos Californians

53
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,010
community members when they think of

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,530
cannabis and when they think of cannabis

55
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:34,079
businesses they think of people selling

56
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,080
cannabis they think of you know direct

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,140
sales to consumers and unfortunately

58
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,660
because we have existed in a era of

59
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:45,379
prohibition where we've lacked

60
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:47,759
regulations we have a market where

61
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:49,289
consumers law enforcement everyday

62
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,590
community members haven't been able to

63
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:55,709
ascertain who is a good operator from

64
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,479
who is a illegitimate operator who may

65
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,570
not have the community members best

66
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,829
interests at mind and so for me part of

67
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:03,629
the reason why I'm excited about this

68
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,310
new phase of Licensing within the city

69
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,560
is that I know that there are good

70
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,140
operators here in the city who have been

71
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,530
waiting for this moment to come out from

72
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,419
underground to say I am a proud cannabis

73
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,069
business owner I'm here to do the right

74
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:18,780
thing I want to make sure that we're you

75
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,699
know protecting and promoting public

76
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,250
health and safety that we have strong

77
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:26,489
youth prevention efforts you know in

78
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,819
mind that we value diversity inclusion

79
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,310
equity and and that is exciting

80
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:33,750
particularly because I think that

81
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,060
historically and this conversation is

82
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,030
shifting very rapidly both at the

83
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,920
federal state and local level but we

84
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,750
we've been so unreasonable that we

85
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,299
haven't even been able to have very very

86
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,370
basic conversations and I think that

87
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,800
there are very complicated conversations

88
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,750
that we have to have whether it be from

89
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,080
the industry side or regulatory side a

90
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,139
health come health conversation a law

91
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,650
enforcement side but I think that

92
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:03,329
together the this industry regulators

93
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,189
the state of California has decided that

94
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,740
there are very basic principles that we

95
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:09,030
can all get behind and that's part of

96
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,550
the effort that the city of Los Angeles

97
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,620
has been trying to move forward and that

98
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,689
we see moving forward across the state

99
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,019
of California with these regulations so

100
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:21,149
I imagine that we're you know we're

101
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,849
still very much in a and moments of

102
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:26,429
transition don't want folks to feel as

103
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,570
though even when these final regulations

104
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,829
get adopted that it's

105
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:34,709
/ this is a process you know people are

106
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:36,810
industries dynamics change overnight but

107
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:38,459
what's important is that I think it's

108
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,660
also important to recognize that we're

109
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:44,099
pouring concrete right now and we want

110
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,080
to make sure that as we pour this

111
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,990
concrete that is going to be absolutely

112
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,849
foundational not only to what happens in

113
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,980
the city of Los Angeles but what happens

114
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,960
in the state of California what happens

115
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,780
in the United States and as other

116
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,180
countries around the world are looking

117
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,969
at the state of California that we can

118
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,090
say that we work together to at least

119
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,970
take care of those basic issues those

120
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:12,689
basic items and so again a little bit

121
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,820
anxious we're 22 minutes away from from

122
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:17,100
going live and I'm not at the office but

123
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:20,099
I'm excited to join folks today I think

124
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,320
it's important to let folks know what we

125
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,180
value what our priorities are and that

126
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,569
we're going through this process with

127
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,550
you

128
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:28,889
I sit up and read regulations on a

129
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,930
regular basis I I feel like sometimes I

130
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,159
look like a crazy person

131
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,150
you know those those large post-it

132
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,600
posted boards that you can hang on your

133
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:38,789
wall

134
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,480
I used to have them all over my living

135
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:44,310
room with with regulations sketched out

136
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,129
I've now moved them to the office and so

137
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:51,060
we have a whole conference room of sorts

138
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:53,969
that has all of these complicated and

139
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,220
challenging exactly but we're all going

140
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,220
through this process together so just to

141
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,680
say I'm excited to be here I'm excited

142
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,870
to be a part of this transition I don't

143
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,310
think that it's going to be easy but I'm

144
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,699
excited because I think it will be

145
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,980
absolutely worth it after my experience

146
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,319
doing campaigns I've realized really

147
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,160
when you go to war and you fight

148
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,099
alongside people there's a

149
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,990
that never really fades or goes away my

150
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,439
hope is that that bond is created with

151
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,090
the entire cannabis industry and that we

152
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,800
start to recognize that I think we're

153
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:30,138
seeing folks working together better

154
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,418
than we have in the past but you know I

155
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,370
do think it's important to recognize so

156
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:36,168
we are all in this together we're all

157
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,060
fighting through this together trying to

158
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:40,939
get the best understanding you know that

159
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,250
we can of a situation of regulations and

160
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:44,839
you know all those unintended issues

161
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,759
that we do still need to address that

162
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:49,848
shouldn't go to the wayside like equity

163
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,220
diversity and inclusion so just a little

164
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:55,430
bit about me I lived in Humboldt County

165
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,530
for over ten years

166
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,538
while living there I became very

167
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:02,538
familiar with the industry not as

168
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:05,598
necessarily you know cannabis as being

169
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:08,050
you know a smoked product only but seen

170
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,779
as an economic driver for families

171
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,418
seeing it you know really help a

172
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:17,059
struggling economy when you know fishing

173
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:19,219
left when you know the timber industry

174
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,959
left it provided a lot of jobs and

175
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,199
provided a lot of stability for the

176
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,569
community the whole way through so I do

177
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:31,009
have a relationship with cannabis during

178
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:32,978
that time I also ran a coffee shop so my

179
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:35,810
coffee shop I considered liberal church

180
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:37,579
it got me very politically involved I

181
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,459
allowed City Council members County

182
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:42,348
Supervisors any anyone running for

183
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:44,930
office to use a coffee shop for meet and

184
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:46,459
greets I really wanted constituents to

185
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,650
be able to talk to their elected

186
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:51,888
officials and really get a better

187
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:54,079
understanding you know of kind of who

188
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,728
they really were you know hold him to

189
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,848
task a little bit force him to answer

190
00:07:55,728 --> 00:08:02,800
your questions which then for me evolved

191
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:05,629
into political work working on campaigns

192
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,418
and working on the law for the last two

193
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:12,259
Pro tems of the Senate in that process

194
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:13,839
at the State Capitol in 2015 they

195
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:16,879
started to take on medical regulations

196
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:20,448
after 19 years of it being legalized in

197
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,788
the state of California in Sacramento at

198
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:24,750
that time it was not encouraged to get

199
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:26,819
involved in cannabis regulations

200
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,649
it was hard to find lobbyists it was

201
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:31,409
hard to find anyone who was politically

202
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:32,848
engaged in the rulemaking process again

203
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,310
it was more of a burden than something

204
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,800
that they were taking on that's when I

205
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:41,489
jumped shut again having a background

206
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:43,168
knowing families and you know many

207
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,389
friends involved in the industry up

208
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:46,860
north made me want to you know try to

209
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:50,189
help and do the best you know that I

210
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,159
could for them I've also always believed

211
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,530
that cannabis should never have been

212
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,289
criminalized in the first place

213
00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:00,929
and I've always believed any day we go

214
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:03,269
on further criminalizing cannabis you

215
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:07,769
know is wrong and at that time that's

216
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:10,439
when prop 64 was being drafted which is

217
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:13,230
when I met cap hacker who was working

218
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,420
for the drug policy Alliance so I'd like

219
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:19,110
to know for you what drove you into

220
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:21,689
getting involved in cannabis regulations

221
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,879
and Prop 64 it's been such an

222
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,150
interesting experience for me over the

223
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:28,470
course of the last two years to

224
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,539
participate in lead parts of this

225
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,480
conversation and I'm extremely

226
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:35,269
appreciative of this position I've had

227
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,159
in the perspective that I've had

228
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:40,740
particularly coming from a nonprofit

229
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,500
organization that focused on all types

230
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,480
of drug policies and really seeing

231
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,299
myself as a community organizer and

232
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,589
somewhat of a agitator to be able to

233
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:56,159
transition into this role and and in in

234
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:58,350
full transparency I got involved in in

235
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:03,659
cannabis policy conversations because I

236
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:06,029
was very much disturbed by the ways that

237
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:08,370
I understood cannabis cannabis

238
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:11,370
businesses and cannabis laws in

239
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:16,830
particular to impact communities that

240
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:19,980
meant a whole lot to me and I I first

241
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:22,860
kind of came into this awakening while I

242
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,659
was in law school and it was my last

243
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,460
year of law school at Ohio at the Ohio

244
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:28,459
State University make sure that it's

245
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:36,780
yeah strangely but I was in Columbus

246
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:38,370
Ohio and I was in law school it was my

247
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:41,338
last year of law school

248
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:44,399
and I was also doing my master's program

249
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,529
at the same time and I was taking this

250
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,558
advanced family law class and I was

251
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:52,528
taking a class called marijuana law and

252
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:56,009
policy and I was also taking this class

253
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:59,578
called loitering and social movements

254
00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:01,289
and really involving myself in all of

255
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:05,278
this coursework while at the same time

256
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:07,139
the state of Ohio was considering to

257
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,448
legalize they were they were trying to

258
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:11,730
be the first state to do both medical

259
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:14,549
and adult youths at the same time now

260
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,289
there are many reasons why that may have

261
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,838
not been successful in Ohio but

262
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:22,649
nevertheless during my time in law

263
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,209
school I had come across a woman

264
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,970
professor and scholar by the name of

265
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:28,258
Michelle Alexander and I had an

266
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,809
opportunity Michelle Alexander is

267
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,818
actually a professor at the Moores

268
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:34,860
College of Law at Ohio State University

269
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:38,278
where I was attending but unfortunately

270
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,079
she had was was going around and touring

271
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,568
about a book that she had written the

272
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:46,438
new Jim Crow and in this book the new

273
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:48,360
Jim Crow she had described and in this

274
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:50,519
this one phrase I want to articulate it

275
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,009
specifically because this is the the one

276
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,749
phrase that really drove me into getting

277
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:57,509
involved in canada's policy

278
00:11:54,749 --> 00:12:00,149
she said that nothing has contributed

279
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,370
more to the systemic mass incarceration

280
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:05,999
of people of color in the United States

281
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:09,870
and the war on drugs and that was such a

282
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:11,399
profound statement to me and I did a

283
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,980
little bit more exploring and

284
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,600
particularly looking into some of the

285
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,389
work that the drug policy Alliance was

286
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,808
doing at the time and I found out that

287
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:26,129
not only was this statement true but

288
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:28,370
that 50% of all drug arrests over 50% of

289
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:31,769
all drug arrests were for marijuana

290
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:34,948
specifically and that 80% of all

291
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:41,028
marijuana arrests were specifically for

292
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:44,428
possession alone and so I the harm that

293
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:47,220
the enforcement of cannabis policies had

294
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:50,458
had on black and brown communities and

295
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,160
also was very cognizant of the fact that

296
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:55,379
this conversation was

297
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:58,259
shifting very quickly and and felt very

298
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:01,340
much as though I needed to get involved

299
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:04,409
in this conversation because I saw that

300
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:07,790
cannabis regulation and legalization was

301
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:11,219
inevitable but getting it right wasn't

302
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:14,699
and that it was going to take some bold

303
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:18,660
and radical statements and actions and

304
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,550
by no means is this anything new there

305
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:23,339
have been organizers in the space in

306
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:25,740
communities that have been articulating

307
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,330
these harms for decades but all of a

308
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,960
sudden there was interest convergence

309
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:33,240
with folks who had some money and with

310
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,600
capitalism and with other things and so

311
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,610
we really the first time started to see

312
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,190
groups that historically would not

313
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,629
communicate with one another get in the

314
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,690
same room and say how are we going to

315
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:48,809
figure out how to make this happen and

316
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:51,420
so at the time I had an opportunity to

317
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:54,239
meet when Lyman who was the state

318
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:57,209
director of the California drug policy

319
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,580
Alliance I flew out to New York where

320
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,110
they were having a conference and I had

321
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,840
a conversation with her and she said I

322
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,730
want to fly out here to serve as the

323
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,389
campaign coordinator for a Californians

324
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,830
for Responsible marijuana reform so I

325
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:13,949
quickly packed up my bags and said I'm

326
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,270
gonna leave Ohio so that we can figure

327
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,580
out how to get this right because I

328
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:21,350
understood is that I understood that

329
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:24,480
even though my original intention was to

330
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,879
impact what was directly happening in my

331
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,100
community in Ohio I understood that if

332
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,899
we could figure it out in California it

333
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,430
was immediately going to get back to

334
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:38,539
Ohio so I was just telling Leslie who's

335
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:41,389
who's here with me Leslie is our

336
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:44,099
communications or community relations

337
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:46,620
manager and director I was telling her

338
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,500
that when I moved out to California I

339
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:52,409
drove out here and I had a three-day

340
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,169
drive with one of my best friends we

341
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:58,879
drove from Ohio to Kansas City Missouri

342
00:14:55,169 --> 00:15:03,319
and from Kansas City Missouri to Denver

343
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:05,870
stopped at a spot in Denver all the way

344
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,300
after Denver we stopped in in Vegas and

345
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,698
when I got to to Vegas my my car got

346
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:12,859
broken into and everything got stolen

347
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:14,948
out of the the backseat of my car and of

348
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,959
course I'm moving across the country so

349
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:21,379
literally everything got got taken at

350
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:25,068
the time but it was time for me to start

351
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:27,740
over in a sense and in my mind and it

352
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:29,568
was a you know time for for me to insert

353
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,339
myself into a conversation that meant a

354
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:34,309
lot to me I know that there was going to

355
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:39,380
be a steep learning curve but I moved

356
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:41,888
out here in July of 2016 and immediately

357
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:44,299
joined this campaign and what was so

358
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:47,409
important to me and of course there were

359
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:51,258
a lot of opinions about Proposition 64

360
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:54,439
but for me and it still been the case

361
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:58,550
that this was the most social justice

362
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:01,430
centered initiative that we had seen and

363
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:03,859
it's my opinion that you know was it

364
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:05,388
enough probably not and we need to make

365
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,490
sure that we're asking for more every

366
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:10,579
single time but this was a conversation

367
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,769
that needed to move forward and I see

368
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:15,469
the same thing happening right now we're

369
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:16,909
in a place where things need to move

370
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,709
forward things that should have moved

371
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:22,490
forward years ago things that should

372
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:25,849
have never been so backwards in the

373
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,198
first place and so I'm excited again

374
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:32,990
time is it

375
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:35,120
11:49 right exactly also excited that

376
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,948
I've had an opportunity to join this

377
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,328
conversation here in the state of

378
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:39,769
California and connect with so many

379
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:42,919
different stakeholders it's such an

380
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:45,470
enormous conversation for us to have but

381
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:49,159
I would implore folks to not be

382
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,470
discouraged by the challenges but to

383
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:55,909
recognize that they are extremely

384
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:59,180
impactful and the time that we spend on

385
00:16:55,909 --> 00:17:01,338
the front end of this is really going to

386
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:03,649
make a difference for in ways that we're

387
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:07,539
not even going to be able to materialize

388
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:10,640
I think in our lifetime and and so

389
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:13,068
that's how I got involved in cannabis

390
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,890
policy no I found one of the more

391
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:16,940
challenging aspects of hop 64 was just

392
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:21,350
first off

393
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:24,140
acknowledging that you know the war on

394
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:26,240
drugs really targeted black and brown

395
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,160
members of our communities getting that

396
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,980
acknowledgement from the cannabis

397
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,480
community seemed very difficult I feel

398
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,380
like one of the largest groups to push

399
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,690
back on us

400
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,630
were a lot of the cultivators in

401
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,910
Northern California which tends to be

402
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:44,750
you know for the most part a very white

403
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:49,160
culture so even getting acknowledgement

404
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,960
that decriminalizing cannabis is an

405
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,390
issue now for black and brown members of

406
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,740
the community and that Prop 64 no matter

407
00:17:53,390 --> 00:18:01,550
what else it said was going to give more

408
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:03,289
social justice relief to these

409
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:04,970
communities did you feel the same way

410
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:07,789
yeah I mean it was it was an interesting

411
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:10,160
conversation again because we were part

412
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:12,319
of a campaign and organizing your you're

413
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,570
figuring out you know who are your

414
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,629
proponents who can you work with to move

415
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:19,609
this conversation forward and through

416
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,380
this work you know there were industry

417
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:22,819
folks who wanted to see this happen and

418
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,490
there were community members and social

419
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:26,899
justice organizations that wanted to see

420
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,509
this happen and you had to get folks in

421
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:33,890
the room to figure out what the sweet

422
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:35,690
spot was and there are a lot of

423
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,100
different stakeholders and perspectives

424
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:41,150
and so everyone doesn't have the same

425
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:43,399
experience but what I think was

426
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,230
important was that there had already

427
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,960
been this acknowledgement that this harm

428
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:54,650
existed and that this harm was caused by

429
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,690
cannabis policies and for me the

430
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:59,840
question has always been well what are

431
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,840
you going to do about it because it's I

432
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:06,230
feel very much as though it's not enough

433
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:09,349
for community members for a society to

434
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:12,170
acknowledge a harm acknowledgment is not

435
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:14,889
enough it's one of the first steps and

436
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:18,650
in order to kind of rectify situations

437
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:21,800
but we needed to figure out what we were

438
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:25,190
going to be able to have that was

439
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:29,049
tangible to community is in I I think

440
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:30,470
again that Prop 64 put some of those

441
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:35,349
components employ

442
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:37,940
so for example proposition 64 was a huge

443
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:39,859
decriminalization effort so cannabis

444
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,278
activities that may have previously been

445
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:45,048
felonies have either been reduced in

446
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:48,259
their penalties or have been made

447
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:52,929
completely legal part of what's so

448
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:55,399
enormous about the decriminalization of

449
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:59,149
proposition 64 is that it was completely

450
00:19:55,398 --> 00:20:01,638
retroactive and so not only do these new

451
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:03,768
penalties do the reduction in these

452
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:06,109
penalties mean that folks in the future

453
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:09,019
aren't going to be subject to the same

454
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:11,028
type of adverse impacts but those folks

455
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:13,929
who had suffered those adverse impacts

456
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:16,429
previously due to felony or misdemeanor

457
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:18,259
cannabis arrests or convictions can now

458
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:22,548
have the opportunity to have their

459
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:24,470
records completely reduced or expunged

460
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:26,028
now I do think that you know there are

461
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,009
efforts around the state of California

462
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:30,019
now to make that effort automatic I

463
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:33,048
think that there are you know strong

464
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:36,288
reasons for communities industry alike

465
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:38,599
to get behind that we know that folks

466
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:42,679
who have had past cannabis arrests or

467
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:46,459
convictions were criminalized and kind

468
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:49,639
of placed in a second class of our

469
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:52,519
society saying you you know you because

470
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:54,229
you do this you're going to be perfectly

471
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,778
it's going to be perfectly legal to

472
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,610
discriminate against you in housing and

473
00:20:56,778 --> 00:21:01,038
it's going to be perfectly legal to

474
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:03,648
discriminate against you in employment

475
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:08,569
in education and when we see those

476
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:09,768
things happening I think again I don't

477
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:12,349
know about you but there's something

478
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:15,169
inside of me that implores me to try and

479
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:18,319
figure out how we fix that and go beyond

480
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:20,500
acknowledging it and so I think that we

481
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,210
had to have very complicated

482
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,109
conversations but also want to share

483
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,058
that I think that it's been a

484
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:27,979
challenging conversation for minority

485
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:31,849
community members to have in their own

486
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,860
communities I spent a lot of time in

487
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:36,048
black and brown communities during the

488
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:38,000
the campaign having a very difficult

489
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:41,538
conversation with community members

490
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,269
around cannabis and past cannabis

491
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:47,229
experiences and the criminal is

492
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:50,778
of cannabis and it's it's so

493
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:53,479
disheartening and unfortunate that you

494
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:55,548
know because of the the way that this

495
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:58,369
environment has existed around cannabis

496
00:21:55,548 --> 00:22:01,219
criminalization community members almost

497
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:03,488
buy into their own oppression in a sense

498
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:06,139
and and criminalized them themselves

499
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:09,139
because of the rhetoric that they have

500
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:11,988
been fed for years and it's important to

501
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:16,069
know that this rhetoric and this

502
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:17,838
association with minority communities

503
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:20,538
and and their particular criminalization

504
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:22,940
is that it was a part of the blueprint

505
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:25,999
for camphor cannabis prohibition from

506
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,969
the beginning and that was something

507
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:32,749
that I had learned very early on I I

508
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:34,909
just recently purchased this book it's

509
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:38,179
called the protectors and it was written

510
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:42,859
about a guy named Harry Anslinger and in

511
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:45,099
Harry Anslinger really came into our

512
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:48,278
position on the heels of the end of

513
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:51,678
alcohol prohibition and he found himself

514
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:53,598
placed in this organization where they

515
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,459
were they they were almost not needed

516
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:57,259
any more alcohol prohibition had ended

517
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,278
and you come into a position where

518
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:01,128
you're supposed to run this organization

519
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:05,108
he needed something to do and

520
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:07,608
unfortunately he chose to spend his time

521
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:11,989
really framing this cannabis

522
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:15,138
criminalization as a black and brown or

523
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:18,999
black and white issue and so we see from

524
00:23:15,138 --> 00:23:22,248
the very beginning Harry Anslinger who

525
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:24,950
again was the head of the Federal Bureau

526
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:28,098
of Narcotics the present-day Drug

527
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:30,200
Enforcement Administration really framed

528
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:32,229
this conversation around saying that

529
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,149
when certain people do this activity

530
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:37,159
that's one thing but when other people

531
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:40,449
do the same activity we're going to call

532
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:43,249
it criminal and and we're going to

533
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:47,058
enforce against these individuals and so

534
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:50,629
to me really 80 years later it's no

535
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:54,048
surprise that we have created and

536
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:55,759
proliferated a system where you know

537
00:23:54,048 --> 00:23:58,099
communities are disproportionately

538
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:01,910
impacted all we needed to

539
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:04,038
go back to the beginning or go back to

540
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,840
the root and that's why I think

541
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:07,669
sometimes it is appropriate wouldn't

542
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:12,109
folks say that what we're doing is

543
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:17,419
radical because radical itself simply

544
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:19,808
means getting to the root and I think

545
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:23,509
it's important for us as we consider

546
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:26,839
future cannabis policies for us to have

547
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:29,150
a real understanding about where all of

548
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:31,849
these policies originated because we're

549
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:34,548
bound to make the same mistakes over and

550
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:38,058
over again I think that again through

551
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:39,829
prop 64 in the campaign we had a good

552
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:41,450
opportunity to frame that conversation

553
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:44,149
but again it's a process everything

554
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,400
wasn't on the table on Proposition 64

555
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,320
and there's a lot more on the table you

556
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,900
know folks often ask community members

557
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,939
what do you have to lose community

558
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,970
members have a lot to lose cannabis

559
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:59,419
consumers have a lot to lose patients

560
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:01,220
medical patients have a lot to lose and

561
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:02,960
things are going to constantly be

562
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,400
shifting and so if we don't have an

563
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,919
understanding of where we've been I

564
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,710
don't think that we're going to even be

565
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:12,770
able to envision a sense of where we're

566
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,960
going but those conversations started

567
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:16,609
very early on and I'm glad you brought

568
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,409
up Harry Anslinger because that brings

569
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:19,879
me to a different point during his

570
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,120
tenure is where we saw the

571
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,559
bastardization of the term black market

572
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:26,899
this term started to gain more

573
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:29,359
prominence during his tenure as he's

574
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,970
tried and successfully targeted black

575
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,959
and brown members of our community it's

576
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,690
something that Kat and I have talked

577
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,779
about before we've seen a resurgence in

578
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:42,350
the use of black market partnered with

579
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:45,710
white market we have not been familiar

580
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:49,009
with these terms as you know really

581
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:52,909
relating to anything other than race and

582
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:55,250
our language matters so you know just a

583
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:56,870
little segue there you know we're trying

584
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,240
to be very conscious of the language

585
00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:00,649
that we use as we're building you know

586
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,569
the foundation to

587
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,910
the cannabis legalization in this

588
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:06,710
country and eventually the world and we

589
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,380
need to be conscious of these terms and

590
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:12,200
how we use them and what they're tied to

591
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,740
so as opposed to using black-market

592
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,630
white market I suggest unregulated

593
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,299
regulated market above-ground market

594
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:23,000
below-ground market anything that takes

595
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:25,069
away you know the racial stigma that has

596
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,250
now been attached to it I'm hearing it

597
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:31,009
used more often you know we have created

598
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:33,259
a CCI a we have created a language

599
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:35,390
matters piece that we've been getting

600
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:37,400
feedback on that I will be releasing but

601
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:40,550
just as we're trying to use cannabis now

602
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,410
as opposed to marijuana based on you

603
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:44,240
know the connection and the the

604
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:47,480
stereotyping of who's using and where

605
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,039
it's coming from it's important you know

606
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,049
and these are emerging issues but I

607
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,839
think before they get too much energy

608
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:55,250
behind them it's important to address

609
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:56,240
you know the black market white market

610
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,890
issue and I don't know if you want to

611
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:10,700
touch on that as well just want to say

612
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:12,679
we're live right so you know I do want

613
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,630
to touch on a few different things and

614
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,970
one of the difficult conversations that

615
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,520
is now starting to happen in hearings at

616
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,950
the Capitol and around the state is what

617
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:25,009
is equity as opposed to what is

618
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:28,400
diversity and what is inclusion as a

619
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:31,009
member of the LGBT community and with

620
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,740
you know the HIV crisis that kind of

621
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:36,710
brought medical cannabis to nationwide

622
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,900
attention you know my acknowledgement is

623
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,509
that I'm looking for an industry that

624
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:44,179
brings in my community which I believe

625
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:47,509
falls into diversity and inclusion and

626
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:51,050
not necessarily equity but I think it is

627
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:52,308
a difficult conversation because I know

628
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:54,109
we heard I think we were in the same

629
00:27:52,308 --> 00:27:56,779
social justice I'm hearing at the

630
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:59,899
capital where folks started to talk

631
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:02,440
about how you know white members of our

632
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:06,450
community who have lived in cultivation

633
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,580
communities have also been targeted by

634
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,490
and should they be included in equity

635
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:12,869
programs you know Native American

636
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,339
communities are trying to work with the

637
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:15,689
state right now to figure out you know

638
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,849
what their pathway is with their

639
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:20,490
sovereignty and you know working in the

640
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:23,309
state market are they a part of equity

641
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,450
how do you see those terms different

642
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:26,849
from one another

643
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:29,150
and how do they intersect this can be a

644
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:31,319
very complicated and complex

645
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:35,190
conversation but it doesn't necessarily

646
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:39,059
need to be I I think that we want to

647
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:42,259
make sure that the industry itself is is

648
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:48,569
representative of all communities right

649
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:51,930
but because of past criminalization we

650
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:54,149
have seen that the actual demographics

651
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,880
and makeup of the industry is

652
00:28:54,150 --> 00:29:01,259
proportionally disproportionately white

653
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:04,110
and male and so I remember you know two

654
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:07,769
three years ago when we started to hear

655
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:10,259
about operators in Colorado being

656
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:13,049
licensed there was this conversation

657
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:16,319
around whoa why is this industry in

658
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:19,169
particular disproportionately white and

659
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:22,049
male and and why aren't there you know

660
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:25,710
minorities participating in this

661
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:27,899
industry and again in order to have that

662
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,539
conversation one would have to have an

663
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:34,500
understanding of the history of

664
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:36,569
criminalization in these communities in

665
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,029
these communities whereas in other

666
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:43,919
communities you may have been able to

667
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:46,710
start a cultivation operation without

668
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,750
fear or the same type of fear of

669
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,910
reprisal from a law enforcement

670
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:54,900
community these community members were

671
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:57,180
being arrested for possession and often

672
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,280
of less than an ounce so if you if you

673
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:02,039
can't even possess something how are you

674
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,990
going to try and formulate how you're

675
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:07,920
going to start a business or organize

676
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:09,930
and get capital and you know you you

677
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,370
can't move around your limited your

678
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:14,759
restricted and so I think that that

679
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:17,309
conversation needed needed to happen but

680
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,869
this conversation around equity at least

681
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:21,349
as it's developed thus

682
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:24,000
far here in the state of California

683
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:25,339
namely with Oakland Sacramento San

684
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,650
Francisco in the city of Los Angeles

685
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:30,689
considering or approving various equity

686
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,030
programs and we now know that the state

687
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:36,200
of Massachusetts is moving forward

688
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:40,160
statewide with an equity program as well

689
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:43,799
this conversation is really for me a

690
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:46,290
conversation around again the harm has

691
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:51,869
been acknowledged what are we going to

692
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:54,210
do about it because across the board

693
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:57,239
we're seeing that public opinion is

694
00:30:54,210 --> 00:31:00,740
changing around cannabis and all you

695
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,779
have to do is look to any you know

696
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,910
bipartisan nonpartisan you know

697
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:09,389
political hopeful and they're going to

698
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:13,470
use that rhetoric I see so many elected

699
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:15,720
officials articulating nowadays that the

700
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,779
war on drugs has been harmful to

701
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,720
community is in that minority

702
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:25,009
communities have been disproportionately

703
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,240
impacted but again if you are a

704
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:30,119
community leader what does that mean to

705
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,579
you what does it mean to you that not

706
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:37,049
only these impacts happened but that

707
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:40,019
they were funded by initiatives that

708
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:42,210
folks put in place and so I think that

709
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:43,619
this equity conversation again as it's

710
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,289
developed here in the state of

711
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:49,019
California the intention here in the

712
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:52,920
city of Los Angeles is to go beyond that

713
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:56,190
acknowledgement and to try and put into

714
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:59,160
place policies that will allow those

715
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:02,990
communities who were denied economic

716
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:05,759
opportunities previously for minor

717
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:09,049
cannabis violations to have an

718
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:11,759
opportunity to have equitable access to

719
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:14,129
economic opportunities as they exist on

720
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,679
the legitimate market and I think it's

721
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,750
particularly important for these

722
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:22,320
communities because again we're going

723
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:25,740
through this shift in time in a sense

724
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:28,769
and although there has been a recent

725
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:31,049
call to decriminalize cannabis activity

726
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:32,789
I don't think that that shift in pattern

727
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:36,659
is going to hold true

728
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:38,629
forever and so we have an opportunity to

729
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:41,430
have these communities who have been

730
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:44,100
historically thought to consume and sell

731
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:45,390
cannabis at higher rates and the truth

732
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,789
of the matter is is that data has shown

733
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:50,610
over and over again that across the

734
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:53,399
board people use and sell cannabis at

735
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:57,119
the same rate regardless of you know

736
00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:00,150
their their their race or ethnic

737
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:02,459
background but again if these are the

738
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:05,340
community members that historically law

739
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,590
enforcement or thinking are using this

740
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:10,949
activity and none of these individuals

741
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:13,769
get licenses or work for entities that

742
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:16,680
have licenses then even as we draw this

743
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:18,900
line between this new line between

744
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,710
what's legal activity and what is

745
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:27,060
illegal activity people are going to be

746
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:29,640
categorically criminalized again because

747
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:32,099
it is still a crime to engage in

748
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,380
commercial cannabis activity without a

749
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:37,649
state license and local authorization so

750
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,600
I don't think that any of the equity

751
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,519
programs as they exist are perfect I

752
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,289
don't think that any regulatory program

753
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,019
is perfect I don't think that any

754
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:47,670
licensing scheme is perfect but I think

755
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,369
that again we're at a point where we

756
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:53,580
have to move forward figure out what our

757
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:56,159
values are do our best to make those

758
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:58,559
things happen and to constantly assess

759
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,600
and analyze how cannabis and cannabis

760
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,389
policies are impacting communities I

761
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:06,119
don't think that for example we do the

762
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:08,460
social equity analysis back in October

763
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,380
September of last year we can't just do

764
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,760
one social equity analysis and assume

765
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,470
that that that's the end of the

766
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,120
conversation there have been decades of

767
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:20,699
of enforcement again against communities

768
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:23,219
thousands over five hundred thousand

769
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:29,699
folks were arrested for cannabis in the

770
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:34,408
last decade and again some folks will

771
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:38,309
see that and say yeah but I care about

772
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:41,579
those people and so my question is what

773
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:45,119
can we do to fix it and make sure that

774
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:46,289
it doesn't happen again so then I have a

775
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,630
two-part follow-up

776
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:50,880
that how do you react eight communities

777
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:54,030
like Compton who have been directly

778
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:56,550
affected and as they went to a vote and

779
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,550
there you know city leaders you know

780
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:02,730
really had a great field campaign you

781
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:03,930
know a lot of door-to-door knocking and

782
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:07,469
they decided that they did not want

783
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:10,319
cannabis in their community based on you

784
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:12,329
know the war on drugs targeting you know

785
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,309
their community members there's still a

786
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:16,889
lot of you know emotion behind that and

787
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:18,389
they still blame cannabis and then I'm

788
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:22,219
wondering if you can kind of give us an

789
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:25,710
overview of LA's equity programs sure

790
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:27,719
you know I I appreciate that prop 64

791
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:29,460
allowed local jurisdictions to have

792
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:32,279
local control I do think that local

793
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,869
control is extremely important and I

794
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,010
think that you know I think that

795
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:37,799
originally there was this expectation

796
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,570
that many jurisdictions would remove

797
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,940
their bans and regulated there's been a

798
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,650
frustration from the industry to you

799
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,349
know open it up and figure out what's

800
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:50,160
going on but this is a very complicated

801
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:52,829
conversation for for folks in I think

802
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:55,109
that there's a lot of Education that's

803
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:56,940
necessary there's historic education

804
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,950
that's necessary about what enforcement

805
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:04,320
has looked like there is a real need to

806
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:07,139
have a honest conversation about health

807
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,960
in cannabis and what I'd like what I'd

808
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:13,639
like to see happen in for the industry

809
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,639
to participate in specifically is that

810
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:19,769
it's difficult for me often to sit in

811
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:21,599
rooms with health officials and health

812
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:24,780
officials are saying lots of inaccurate

813
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,779
information about campus right but it's

814
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,150
also not helpful to sit in industry

815
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,910
spaces and for industry folks to say

816
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:35,010
well cannabis isn't harmful because

817
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:38,940
that's not necessarily true

818
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:41,460
and I think that you know folks come

819
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,679
into these conversations and they just

820
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,809
want to say but they have to say and not

821
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,129
listen to what other folks have to say

822
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:49,860
and you you're not gonna make progress

823
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:53,369
there and so I do think that there's a

824
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:55,070
real need to have I don't know if the

825
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:57,480
you know if you all have a Health

826
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:59,700
Committee or council but it would be

827
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,530
great to have some

828
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:03,779
city and county and state health

829
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,269
officials be a part of that conversation

830
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,069
and for you all to be invited to their

831
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:10,469
conversations because it's almost like

832
00:37:08,068 --> 00:37:11,969
there are two different cannabis is that

833
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:14,009
people are talking about I would say

834
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:16,139
right the barrier has been huge right

835
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,940
something that we learned you know over

836
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:20,250
these years like we do speak our own

837
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,380
language and we expect everyone knows

838
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,030
the terminology that we're using and

839
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,579
that's not necessarily true

840
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,200
I remember one specific meeting where we

841
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:30,019
got half an hour and we were talking

842
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:32,129
about different forms of extraction and

843
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:34,079
safety standards and they stopped is

844
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,940
really can you just tell us like how

845
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,010
many cycles are in a year does it start

846
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,960
with a starch or a seed and we were just

847
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,150
like wow we've been talking over your

848
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,068
head but then they also need to be

849
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,260
educated about our language about best

850
00:37:44,068 --> 00:37:48,000
practices but they need to educate us on

851
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,380
the creation of good policy and what

852
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,079
that really looks like so I think that's

853
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:55,019
foreign to many of us but that language

854
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,930
barrier in that educational yeah I feel

855
00:37:55,019 --> 00:38:00,239
like a translator of sorts at some times

856
00:37:57,929 --> 00:38:03,088
and I'll sit in rooms and I appreciate

857
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,558
that I have the ability to translate

858
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:07,019
these conversations but I'll say you

859
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,210
know health officials say well cannabis

860
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:10,949
is as harmful is you know some other

861
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,869
substance that's clearly not that

862
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:14,818
cannabis is clearly not as harmful as

863
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:17,068
and it's you know pull those folks aside

864
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:19,949
and say you know that that's not true we

865
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:22,409
and I'm not a health official and I I

866
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:24,618
don't you you'll never hear me make any

867
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:27,690
health related claims that's not my

868
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:29,700
place as a regulatory agency but at the

869
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,849
same time I experience a real

870
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:35,909
frustration and in folks not wanting to

871
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:38,579
have a very just honest and realistic

872
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:40,920
conversation sometimes cannabis is going

873
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:47,519
to be extremely helpful sometimes it's

874
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:50,190
not I don't think that we need to be so

875
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,889
selfish in a sense and and say that

876
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,780
cannabis can only be one thing and I

877
00:38:52,889 --> 00:38:56,219
think that the industry has a huge

878
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,250
responsibility and in leading that

879
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:02,519
effort and so do city county and state

880
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:05,400
health agencies but this is just kind of

881
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:06,599
one aspect of ways that folks need to be

882
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,119
able to communicate with one another

883
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,460
industry operators have to change the

884
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,108
type of interactions that they've had

885
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,099
with their neighbors and community

886
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:16,679
members

887
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:19,980
you know some community members really

888
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:25,109
really don't want to have you know exit

889
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:28,530
bags and the caps on the ground if you

890
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:30,840
can pick up the trash in your community

891
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,820
or just on your premises and that is the

892
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,730
only complaint that a community member

893
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:40,500
has why wouldn't you take care of that

894
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:42,360
immediately very simple things if your

895
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,269
you know your your existing in a space

896
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,160
where people don't want there to be a

897
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:49,619
cannabis consumption and I recognize

898
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:52,159
that the we really do need to figure out

899
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:55,199
how we're going to take care of these

900
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,609
conversations about consumption but

901
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,730
let's not go around blowing smoke in

902
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:01,980
people's faces just be reasonable be

903
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:04,769
respectful and I I think that for so

904
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,510
long there were these camps of people

905
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,769
who were either forward or against it

906
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,410
and and folks didn't want to communicate

907
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:12,210
and the reality is is that most

908
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:15,059
community members exist somewhere in the

909
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:17,670
middle we have to recognize that I think

910
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:20,309
that the folks in this room can be

911
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:22,110
enthusiasts and we're activists and are

912
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:23,820
on one side of the spectrum of wanting

913
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,740
to see change and there are other folks

914
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,690
who exist who are on the completely

915
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:30,389
other end of the spectrum but most folks

916
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:32,280
exist somewhere in the middle and if

917
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:34,889
they're just constantly being fed

918
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,310
misinformation they're not going to make

919
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:40,589
any progress and I think that as a as an

920
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:44,250
industry you know folks have taken

921
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:46,140
really really good effort at this point

922
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,599
to move the conversation forward but I'm

923
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:50,549
very excited to see over the course of

924
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,449
the next year and over the course of the

925
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:56,070
next several years how we again can

926
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:57,779
there are things that were there are

927
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:00,150
things that we're not going to agree on

928
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,800
and and and we just may be on the

929
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,079
opposite ends of the table but there's

930
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,870
so much that we can figure out

931
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,090
immediately again and that's what I'm

932
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:12,000
interested in figuring out as quickly as

933
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:14,610
possible and so can you give us a brief

934
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,800
overview of LA's equity program and then

935
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:20,970
I'd also like to know what do you need

936
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,519
to succeed sure so the city of Los

937
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:25,889
Angeles has developed a social equity

938
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,940
program that was largely borne out of a

939
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:29,578
social equity analysis

940
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:33,480
that took place in the fall of last year

941
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:34,710
this analysis looked at arrest rates

942
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,139
throughout the city and tried to

943
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,760
identify various characteristics and

944
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:40,828
criteria of individuals who had

945
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,020
experienced this past cannabis

946
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:44,519
criminalization so what they found was

947
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:45,750
that you know there were certain zip

948
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,150
codes throughout the city that were

949
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,429
disproportionately impacted that folks

950
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,960
were traditionally that could be

951
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:55,409
low-income that were disproportionately

952
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,730
impacted and also you know we were

953
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:59,039
talking about communities that have been

954
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:01,219
impacted but folks who themselves have

955
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:04,079
had nonviolent cannabis convictions

956
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:06,118
individually have been impacted so

957
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,818
through one identifying who these

958
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:12,240
individuals and community members were

959
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:14,068
who could potentially qualify the next

960
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,049
step was to figure out what what

961
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:18,210
barriers exist for these particular

962
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,039
community members should they decide

963
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:22,318
that they want to participate in the

964
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:24,539
industry and I think that you know folks

965
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,130
in this room know exactly what those

966
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:28,440
barriers are as they go through the

967
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:31,980
process of trying to get licenses I

968
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,200
either at the state or local level but

969
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,990
part of what we tried to do is to look

970
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:39,059
at how our regulatory and licensing

971
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:41,549
framework where it was going to be set

972
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:44,159
up and to try and figure out what were

973
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:47,730
some things that we could do and put in

974
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,899
place to try in not you know I don't

975
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,659
think that we were going to be able to

976
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,389
do everything that entities needed in

977
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:57,838
order to move forward but how could we

978
00:42:53,389 --> 00:43:00,299
give folks more equitable access to this

979
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:03,318
industry and so it's really based on

980
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,700
what these community members may need

981
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:08,550
within the city of Los Angeles we have a

982
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:12,118
framework that is can be generally

983
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:15,300
described as first-come first-serve with

984
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,849
the various caps that have been put in

985
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,140
place throughout the the city so just

986
00:43:17,849 --> 00:43:21,230
for way of background for folks who

987
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:25,049
aren't familiar the city of Los Angeles

988
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:26,760
has 35 different community plans and

989
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:29,190
what the city of Los Angeles has done is

990
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,819
that they've decided and limited the

991
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,559
number of licenses for certain

992
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:37,559
commercial cannabis activities that can

993
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:40,920
take place as a part of a particular

994
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:44,309
community plan namely for cultivation in

995
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,619
retail activities manufacturing

996
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:48,630
distribution testing these aren't the

997
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:50,940
type of activities that have limits

998
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:53,670
within our our system but cultivation

999
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:56,220
and retail do and so for example a

1000
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:58,920
particular Community Plan may only allow

1001
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:02,250
for eleven retail licenses where another

1002
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,409
Community Plan may allow for 22 or so

1003
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,360
retail licenses but what the city of Los

1004
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:08,969
Angeles has done is said that once these

1005
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:12,720
community plan caps are met once we've

1006
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:15,389
issued licenses and these community plan

1007
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,099
caps are met the department in the city

1008
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:19,859
will consider that particular community

1009
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:21,960
plan to have undue concentration and

1010
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:24,900
once a particular community plan has

1011
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,970
undue concentration the Department of

1012
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:30,090
cannabis regulation can't process any

1013
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:32,789
additional licenses on last City Council

1014
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:35,430
specifically approve that particular

1015
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:37,529
license to be processed so just so folks

1016
00:44:35,429 --> 00:44:39,779
know what the framework is now

1017
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,490
throughout the city with these various

1018
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,930
community plan caps that means that we

1019
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:45,029
have an unlimited number of distribution

1020
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:47,190
licenses that can be issued an unlimited

1021
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:50,100
number of testing licenses that can be

1022
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:52,920
issued a unlimited number of at least

1023
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:54,599
nonvolatile menuing manufacturing

1024
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,940
facilities that can be used but for

1025
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:58,469
cultivation and retail

1026
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,240
folks who are going to have to after

1027
00:44:58,469 --> 00:45:03,119
this these community plan caps are met

1028
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:06,809
to go through this PCN process so again

1029
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:11,880
priority in our system is extremely

1030
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:13,829
important because after a certain cap is

1031
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,220
met the decision becomes completely

1032
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:19,049
discretionary to City Council so one of

1033
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:20,730
the things that we've built our program

1034
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:23,970
around within the social equity program

1035
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:26,159
it's priority processing so the way that

1036
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:29,369
the priority processing is set up in the

1037
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:31,889
city generally we have two phases of

1038
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:34,319
priority processing and then the

1039
00:45:31,889 --> 00:45:37,109
processing of general applications in

1040
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,420
which we give priority to social equity

1041
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,220
applicants so our phase one that we

1042
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,720
started back in January that's

1043
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:45,509
considered phase one of priority

1044
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:49,039
processing phase two which started about

1045
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,040
nineteen minutes ago

1046
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:53,759
that's phase two of the priority

1047
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:56,610
processing now when we get to the

1048
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,040
processing of annual applications the

1049
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:00,870
City Council has said that the type of

1050
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,929
processing that they want social equity

1051
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:06,739
applicants to get is as follows for

1052
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:09,299
retail activity the department is to

1053
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:13,259
process applications on a two to one

1054
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:16,140
ratio meaning that we would process two

1055
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:18,570
social equity applications for every one

1056
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:22,199
general application that's for retail

1057
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:24,750
activity for non retail activity we are

1058
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:26,789
to process applications on a one to one

1059
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:28,440
ratio so for every one retail

1060
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:30,750
application that we passed a general

1061
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,059
application process we can process one

1062
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:37,800
social equity application so priority

1063
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:40,920
processing although it may not you know

1064
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:43,370
sound as as helpful it's actually very

1065
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,930
helpful with within our system the other

1066
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:49,679
type of benefits that the social equity

1067
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:52,889
program imagined were business licensing

1068
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:56,369
and compliance assistance and the

1069
00:46:52,889 --> 00:46:59,489
ordinances also reference that a fee

1070
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:01,500
deferral program may be available at a

1071
00:46:59,489 --> 00:47:03,959
later date and that folks may have an

1072
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,510
access to an industry investment fund

1073
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,940
now I'll put the industry investment

1074
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:10,350
fund in the fee waivers to the side for

1075
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,590
a moment because those are kind of

1076
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:16,500
pending policies and we we haven't been

1077
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:18,960
able to fully implement the policies

1078
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,690
that are existing right now but over the

1079
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,829
course of the next several months the

1080
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:25,710
Department of cannabis regulation is

1081
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:27,779
going to be developing and implementing

1082
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:30,980
what this business licensing and

1083
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:34,260
compliance assistance looks like and so

1084
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:36,929
you know we're going to be very open to

1085
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,760
feedback from community members into

1086
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:39,899
potential social equity applicants so

1087
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,660
that we make sure that we're building

1088
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:45,720
out of a program that is complimentary

1089
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:47,549
to to folks needs and of course because

1090
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:53,789
we're dealing in a evolving landscape

1091
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:55,320
those those needs might change but over

1092
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:59,360
the course of the of the next several

1093
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:02,240
months I think that you'll start to see

1094
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:04,070
at least intentions to go out and do

1095
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:07,519
educational efforts I know that we put

1096
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:09,890
out a workshop last week in the valley

1097
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,989
we we hosted a workshop on our next

1098
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:14,420
phase of Licensing but there's a lot of

1099
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:17,479
work to do to get this social equity

1100
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:19,570
program off the ground in its most basic

1101
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:23,389
iteration it is a Business Development

1102
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:25,789
Program and I don't know if folks in the

1103
00:48:23,389 --> 00:48:28,759
room have participated in launching

1104
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:32,949
business development programs but this

1105
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:35,180
is a extra tricky case because

1106
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:36,289
businesses cannabis businesses are going

1107
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:38,799
through something that's very very

1108
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:42,019
unique as many folks in this room know

1109
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,150
the landscape is changing we're

1110
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:46,610
operating under emergency regulations

1111
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:48,650
there are jurisdictions opening up on a

1112
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:51,620
regular basis folks or forum-shopping

1113
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:53,420
there are conversations around land and

1114
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:56,569
building and all of these still looking

1115
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:58,039
thank you yeah very very very simple

1116
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,930
things that other businesses don't have

1117
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:02,239
to go through and so I think it's going

1118
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:05,389
to require us to be very intentional to

1119
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,529
be flexible but part of the the issue is

1120
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:09,019
that there really needs to be an

1121
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:11,810
elevation of the conversation because I

1122
00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:14,679
don't think that folks who you know

1123
00:49:11,809 --> 00:49:18,559
again we're a very unique group in that

1124
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:20,839
you know we're invested we're active in

1125
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,940
this advocacy most folks have no idea

1126
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:26,120
what what this process looks like and is

1127
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:27,980
going on so I don't think that folks

1128
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:31,400
really understand the extent of the

1129
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:34,730
challenges that this industry is facing

1130
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,530
or the resources that are necessary or

1131
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:40,130
what happens when you don't have access

1132
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:42,620
to those resources and so you know I I

1133
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:45,440
encourage folks to organize and make

1134
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:48,469
sure that you know folks are moving the

1135
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,389
conversation along but know that as a

1136
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:53,480
regulator we're trying to figure it out

1137
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:54,980
ourselves and how do we help you how do

1138
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,740
we help you succeed in this process

1139
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:59,210
because like many states many countries

1140
00:49:57,739 --> 00:50:01,609
are paying attention to what's happening

1141
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:02,449
in California I think a lot of folks are

1142
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:04,519
paying attention to what's happening

1143
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:06,500
with the social equity program in Los

1144
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:08,059
Angeles and it will probably be a model

1145
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,070
that will be implemented throughout our

1146
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:11,420
state as well as many other states so

1147
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:12,829
how do we help you make this process

1148
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,650
successful and

1149
00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:18,380
educate you know not only the industry

1150
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:21,229
but consumers as well absolutely so I

1151
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:25,539
really see myself as a again a

1152
00:50:21,228 --> 00:50:28,248
translator of sorts in a canary of sorts

1153
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:31,549
and I so these are the ways that you can

1154
00:50:28,248 --> 00:50:33,528
help me there's a ton of education

1155
00:50:31,548 --> 00:50:37,179
that's necessary across the board

1156
00:50:33,528 --> 00:50:40,369
whether it be industry operators

1157
00:50:37,179 --> 00:50:42,048
cannabis consumers and patients or

1158
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:44,390
community members who are concerned

1159
00:50:42,048 --> 00:50:46,909
about cannabis businesses in their

1160
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:50,778
community each of these different groups

1161
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:54,078
have their own interests have may have

1162
00:50:50,778 --> 00:50:55,969
their own values or concerns but if

1163
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,099
we're not sharing information with one

1164
00:50:55,969 --> 00:51:02,659
another about what our needs are what

1165
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:04,700
our concerns are the environment that we

1166
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:08,208
are currently in and the environment

1167
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:09,858
that we'd like to see ourselves in if we

1168
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:12,919
can't have that conversation we're not

1169
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:15,440
going to get to action so I think one of

1170
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,380
the first things that we can do together

1171
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,690
the industry and regulators is to make

1172
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,660
sure that there are open lines of

1173
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:25,489
communication to share information into

1174
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:27,170
you know not necessarily assume that

1175
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:28,548
everyone knows anything and don't hold

1176
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,889
it against someone for not knowing

1177
00:51:28,548 --> 00:51:33,528
something a community members law

1178
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:35,028
enforcement health officials alike in

1179
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:36,559
order for us to get this done we all

1180
00:51:35,028 --> 00:51:38,268
need to make some changes and so I don't

1181
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,190
think that anyone has it all figured out

1182
00:51:38,268 --> 00:51:42,948
so I think that we need to figure it out

1183
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:46,219
and work together to make that happen

1184
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:48,318
in addition that's that's the the

1185
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:51,229
translator piece the canary piece is

1186
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:53,630
also it's that again when you have

1187
00:51:51,228 --> 00:51:56,239
information once you have been educated

1188
00:51:53,630 --> 00:52:00,349
in the sense and you recognize that

1189
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:06,108
something is awry or something is wrong

1190
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:10,039
please don't sit stagnant with that

1191
00:52:06,108 --> 00:52:11,929
feeling if you are experiencing harm if

1192
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:13,910
you're aware of community members and

1193
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:16,118
individual experiencing harm there's a

1194
00:52:13,909 --> 00:52:18,639
saying that the personal is political

1195
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:21,349
you're not alone in this

1196
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,728
there again hundreds of thousands of

1197
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:24,170
people who have been arrested hundreds

1198
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:25,369
of thousand people who have been denied

1199
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,800
education

1200
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:29,480
educational opportunities for the

1201
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:32,019
industry itself I think that you all

1202
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,460
have a huge responsibility to consumers

1203
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:36,590
they need real information the ability

1204
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,119
to make informed decisions about things

1205
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:40,400
that they're going to be putting into

1206
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:43,960
their bodies they also need to have a

1207
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:47,300
real understanding of the social impacts

1208
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,670
that still exist with consuming or

1209
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:52,430
associating with cannabis people can

1210
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:54,889
still lose their jobs for drug tests you

1211
00:52:52,429 --> 00:52:57,349
can still be denied you get pulled over

1212
00:52:54,889 --> 00:53:00,379
you could potentially lose your your

1213
00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:03,409
license people public housing is going

1214
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:05,780
smoke-free so we can imagine that for

1215
00:53:03,409 --> 00:53:07,730
low-income communities particularly you

1216
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:09,560
know whether or not they're even if it

1217
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:12,920
is a medical condition this is going to

1218
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:14,509
disproportionately impact people who are

1219
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,510
using your product because they're using

1220
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:21,080
your product again what does it mean to

1221
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:24,620
you and I think that if collectively we

1222
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:28,460
can figure out how to have these shared

1223
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:30,349
values and to take care of industry to

1224
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:34,099
take care of community to take care of

1225
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:36,380
consumers again many complicated

1226
00:53:34,099 --> 00:53:38,210
conversations that will struggle and

1227
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,740
I'll sit across the room from folks and

1228
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:44,480
look folks in the eye and say I don't

1229
00:53:39,739 --> 00:53:48,259
agree that will happen but I think these

1230
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:51,829
areas are the things that we we owe it

1231
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:53,450
to ourselves if you're a industry

1232
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:55,849
operator and you're in this for the long

1233
00:53:53,449 --> 00:53:59,359
haul you owe it to the legacy of your

1234
00:53:55,849 --> 00:54:03,369
operation and whoever you plan to hand

1235
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:07,099
this off to to make sure that you're on

1236
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:09,469
the right side that's something you know

1237
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:12,500
we all need to keep in mind you know I

1238
00:54:09,469 --> 00:54:14,149
continually tell fellows and younger you

1239
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,889
know political folks from the Capitol

1240
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,389
like if you're interested in public

1241
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:19,519
safety and public health come into

1242
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:21,889
cannabis if you're interested in social

1243
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,780
equity come into cannabis there is so

1244
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:25,339
much happening within this industry

1245
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:27,800
right now and that's why it's so dynamic

1246
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,240
but it's also the foundation that's

1247
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,150
being built and there is a lot of

1248
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:35,389
responsibility we do have in educating

1249
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:37,900
folks again you know within the industry

1250
00:54:35,389 --> 00:54:39,549
the CCI a we've probably given over

1251
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,559
two words of commercial facilities I

1252
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:43,269
know cats been on a few of those opening

1253
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:46,059
people's eyes up and being able to talk

1254
00:54:43,269 --> 00:54:48,309
to operators is key I always say coming

1255
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:49,989
out of the closet you know I come out of

1256
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:53,199
the closet all the time as a cannabis

1257
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:55,689
consumer you know I exercise and

1258
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:58,750
cannabis shirts I the cultural shift

1259
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:00,460
that we need to make happen is real you

1260
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,380
know talking about going into meetings

1261
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:04,119
and having people closed off with their

1262
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,220
assumptions of what cannabis is and who

1263
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:08,949
we are as a community is real I've

1264
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:11,679
walked out of County Supervisor meetings

1265
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:13,299
you know and stats were thrown out about

1266
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,009
this being a gateway drug and when I

1267
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,120
asked what survey what study that came

1268
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:18,070
from I said well it's just a feeling

1269
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,170
well we're moving past that this

1270
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:23,320
industry is legitimizing it is

1271
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:26,050
professionalizing we need to honor the

1272
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:28,120
diversity and inclusion and equity that

1273
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:30,580
created this industry and make sure

1274
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:32,679
that's reflective you know within our

1275
00:55:30,579 --> 00:55:34,719
community the whole way through so I

1276
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:38,259
know you need to start checking messages

1277
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:41,799
and I want to honor your team I'm so

1278
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:45,070
happy to take any few questions before

1279
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:47,350
we let go of can was very curious about

1280
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:49,870
you're talking about having a framework

1281
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:51,819
for a language did you work with cats

1282
00:55:49,869 --> 00:55:54,069
Department to to help develop that

1283
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:55,570
language but more importantly when is

1284
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,830
that going to be available um we

1285
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:59,320
actually worked we have a diversity and

1286
00:55:56,829 --> 00:56:01,299
inclusion committee at CCI a so what we

1287
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:03,220
did is one we started with educating

1288
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:06,100
ourselves on the issues we brought on

1289
00:56:03,219 --> 00:56:08,349
hood incubator that could educate us on

1290
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:10,210
you know the the troubles they've had

1291
00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:12,670
with their equity program to talk about

1292
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:15,039
the war on drugs to talk about you know

1293
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:17,230
issues that I might not see that they're

1294
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,300
dealing with on a regular basis even you

1295
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:21,340
know one of the the program issues that

1296
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:23,350
I found from hood incubator is once they

1297
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:25,269
do get folks through the process and

1298
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:27,429
they're able to get a grant what did

1299
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:28,659
they do with that Chuck you're giving

1300
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:30,159
somebody a check they can't get a bank

1301
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:32,079
account you know to get them off the

1302
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:33,819
ground all of these just little you know

1303
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,159
different issues we brought on

1304
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,559
minorities for medical marijuana they

1305
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,539
can help educate us as well you know and

1306
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:43,440
we've continued to do that trying to

1307
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:46,000
make sure that our messaging is

1308
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,880
sensitive and is not creating further

1309
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,639
stigma and

1310
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,579
we shape or form so we'll be releasing

1311
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:54,469
that soon yeah yeah again language does

1312
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:55,610
matter at the whole black-white market

1313
00:56:54,469 --> 00:56:58,909
thing I think is something we need to

1314
00:56:55,610 --> 00:57:02,750
address right quick before it gains

1315
00:56:58,909 --> 00:57:39,799
momentum so yeah that we have done you

1316
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:41,679
know as an association much as we've

1317
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,240
changed part of this

1318
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:47,619
what do you program is there any way

1319
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:49,359
under really gonna do with that if we

1320
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:55,359
can start making sure that we don't

1321
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:57,940
utilize any more I imagine you know when

1322
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:01,809
folks get organized amazing things

1323
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:03,730
happen right and so I can imagine you

1324
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:06,429
know the industry community members

1325
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:08,860
approaching a legislator and saying we

1326
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:11,099
want to adopt state legislation

1327
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,570
statewide legislation that would strike

1328
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:16,719
black market and replace with

1329
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:18,730
unregulated market or in the future in

1330
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:21,219
future communications and any type of

1331
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:23,409
thing that's going to be an official

1332
00:58:21,219 --> 00:58:25,299
publication in a talking point that are

1333
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:28,000
going to come from someone's public

1334
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:31,420
relations office that we're not going to

1335
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,920
use that term I would be very excited to

1336
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,320
see something like that I think

1337
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:38,860
internally within the city of Los

1338
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:41,170
Angeles and again you you say this and

1339
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:43,320
then you might catch yourself saying

1340
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:46,420
black market right and so it's a process

1341
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:48,519
to purge the the word from our

1342
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,079
vocabulary but within the city of Los

1343
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:52,150
Angeles and within my department I've

1344
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,400
let my staff know you know they're a

1345
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:56,500
couple of phrases that I think that we

1346
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,349
need to to change and so I think that

1347
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:01,539
part of what we want to do is to first

1348
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:04,509
internally make sure that we're cleaning

1349
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:05,920
up our language lead by example and then

1350
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:09,820
when other folks start to adopt that

1351
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:13,090
language again that impact don't doesn't

1352
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:16,180
just carry throughout the state but it

1353
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:16,750
give it gets back to Ohio right yeah no

1354
00:59:16,179 --> 00:59:18,099
doubt

1355
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:20,469
and I would say it is happening at the

1356
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:22,119
state level you know as much as we

1357
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:23,829
started to bring that up to them that's

1358
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:25,719
why it's now the the Bureau of cannabis

1359
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:27,279
control you know they've started to get

1360
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:29,409
that we've started to bring up the black

1361
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,500
market white market issue we're starting

1362
00:59:29,409 --> 00:59:34,179
to see progress in bill language and but

1363
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,679
it does take us bringing it up they're

1364
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:37,690
not going to do it on their own you know

1365
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:41,069
we have to educate them on why it's an

1366
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:41,070
issue and what the solution is

1367
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:50,170
I'm the Trudy and I've got some well a

1368
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:53,400
strong personal passion and some work

1369
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,400
experience in economics

1370
00:59:53,539 --> 00:59:57,649
and so my concern for maybe two one into

1371
00:59:56,478 --> 01:00:00,228
your shoes don't you like what do you

1372
00:59:57,648 --> 01:00:02,148
have we can see is that potentially some

1373
01:00:00,228 --> 01:00:04,968
of these business owners have never

1374
01:00:02,148 --> 01:00:07,159
renovated and cannabis is a highly

1375
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:09,619
regulated business it's going to require

1376
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:11,358
a lot of administrative knowledge a lot

1377
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:14,630
of dodging the eyes crossing the keys

1378
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:17,358
tax law advising accounting advising

1379
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:19,548
business formation advising that people

1380
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:24,438
can't go to the SBA and say I'm starting

1381
01:00:19,548 --> 01:00:33,708
a cannabis business company so is the

1382
01:00:24,438 --> 01:00:35,298
DCR planning workshops right so it

1383
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:37,368
sounds like you said you have a

1384
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:39,679
background in in doing some of that that

1385
01:00:37,369 --> 01:00:43,278
work and so again we passed these

1386
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:46,219
policies back in December of last year

1387
01:00:43,278 --> 01:00:47,838
part of the complication and challenge

1388
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:51,019
is that the city hasn't dedicated any

1389
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:53,418
specific funding towards the the program

1390
01:00:51,018 --> 01:00:57,588
and you can imagine even if you were to

1391
01:00:53,418 --> 01:00:59,688
get one of these SBA's - you know even

1392
01:00:57,588 --> 01:01:00,978
do what they normally do for cannabis

1393
01:00:59,688 --> 01:01:02,388
business and there are conversations

1394
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:05,208
about whether or not they can even use

1395
01:01:02,389 --> 01:01:06,588
their regular services for cannabis

1396
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:09,678
businesses because they received federal

1397
01:01:06,588 --> 01:01:12,199
funding but work it's our intention to

1398
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:14,389
build that type of program and be able

1399
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:16,278
to implement that type of program the

1400
01:01:14,389 --> 01:01:19,278
challenge is is that this is not a

1401
01:01:16,278 --> 01:01:22,159
program that's born overnight and people

1402
01:01:19,278 --> 01:01:26,358
need resources and information now so I

1403
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:28,939
think in the interim you will see me and

1404
01:01:26,358 --> 01:01:31,058
my staff out in the community sharing

1405
01:01:28,938 --> 01:01:34,638
information and trying to provide

1406
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:37,909
education but I want to be very

1407
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:40,909
transparent in saying that you know it's

1408
01:01:37,909 --> 01:01:45,229
it's not my subject matter expertise -

1409
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:47,568
to implement or to specific to

1410
01:01:45,228 --> 01:01:49,338
specifically develop a business

1411
01:01:47,568 --> 01:01:53,528
development program so we're going to

1412
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:56,058
have to bring on that capacity and again

1413
01:01:53,528 --> 01:01:58,068
that capacity is going to need to be

1414
01:01:56,059 --> 01:02:02,179
funded so I think that there are still

1415
01:01:58,068 --> 01:02:05,748
very basic issues that the city of Los

1416
01:02:02,179 --> 01:02:07,130
Angeles is trying to work out you know

1417
01:02:05,748 --> 01:02:10,459
it's it's my

1418
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:13,220
in tension and in full transparency to

1419
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:15,500
not begin phase three until those things

1420
01:02:13,219 --> 01:02:18,469
are up and running now that's going to

1421
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:22,699
cause some complications for folks but I

1422
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:25,459
think that in order for us to make good

1423
01:02:22,699 --> 01:02:27,669
on our promise that's what it's going to

1424
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,670
take

1425
01:02:35,469 --> 01:02:41,449
absolutely and I think that there going

1426
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:42,230
to be some upcoming efforts to do just

1427
01:02:41,449 --> 01:02:44,858
that

1428
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:47,990
so let me share some of those with you

1429
01:02:44,858 --> 01:02:49,338
one I would invite folks to come to the

1430
01:02:47,989 --> 01:02:50,858
next cannabis Regulation Commission

1431
01:02:49,338 --> 01:02:54,349
meeting that's going to be on the 9th

1432
01:02:50,858 --> 01:02:56,029
it's going to be in Dean auditorium and

1433
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:58,039
so it's not going to be in in City Hall

1434
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:59,930
council chambers again but we have the

1435
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:02,809
information on our website at cannabis

1436
01:02:59,929 --> 01:03:04,219
LA City org so I would implore folks to

1437
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:05,869
come to the cannabis Regulation

1438
01:03:04,219 --> 01:03:07,759
Commission meeting it's going to be

1439
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:09,588
these are new members who have been

1440
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,440
appointed we've had one meeting at this

1441
01:03:09,588 --> 01:03:14,059
point steep learning curve for the

1442
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,519
cannabis industry but they need to know

1443
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:18,799
that this is a concern and then

1444
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:20,829
similarly folks may have seen that

1445
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:24,560
yesterday the city of Los Angeles

1446
01:03:20,829 --> 01:03:26,420
officially rescinded what was originally

1447
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,769
the cannabis Reinvestment Act and so

1448
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:29,809
there was supposed to be an initiative

1449
01:03:27,769 --> 01:03:32,269
that was put on the ballot this November

1450
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:33,889
to create some new tax provisions that

1451
01:03:32,269 --> 01:03:36,800
could have funded a number of different

1452
01:03:33,889 --> 01:03:38,809
cannabis programs could have developed

1453
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,150
funding for the social equity program

1454
01:03:38,809 --> 01:03:43,608
for a number of reasons that I agree

1455
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:46,250
with the cannabis Reinvestment Act was

1456
01:03:43,608 --> 01:03:48,980
rescinded and instead there was an

1457
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:50,869
instruction given to various departments

1458
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:54,250
the cannabis Department of cannabis

1459
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:57,858
regulation included to report back on

1460
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:59,150
programming costs and so very soon the

1461
01:03:57,858 --> 01:04:01,519
Department of cannabis regulation is

1462
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:05,450
going to be submitting a interim budget

1463
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:06,588
request for three things namely we're

1464
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:08,569
going to submit an interim budget

1465
01:04:06,588 --> 01:04:12,019
request for a public education outreach

1466
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:13,970
campaign staff training and for the

1467
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:16,550
development of a social equity program

1468
01:04:13,969 --> 01:04:18,439
and as a part of those budget requests

1469
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:22,339
we'll also put together recommendations

1470
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:26,539
on the city's budget policy for both our

1471
01:04:22,338 --> 01:04:29,659
regulatory program and enforcement but I

1472
01:04:26,539 --> 01:04:33,349
would definitely encourage folks to stay

1473
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:34,879
involved here and then also folks should

1474
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:36,588
be aware that you know it's it's not

1475
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,410
just the city of Los Angeles that needs

1476
01:04:36,588 --> 01:04:42,108
to move on this issue I'd love to see

1477
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:45,618
the industry independently move on this

1478
01:04:42,108 --> 01:04:48,299
issue I'd love to see the state of

1479
01:04:45,619 --> 01:04:49,620
California join in an effort to

1480
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:52,710
move on this issue we do know that

1481
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:55,019
they're still pending legislation and

1482
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:57,900
money that could be developed at the

1483
01:04:55,019 --> 01:05:01,139
state level and diverted to local equity

1484
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:05,030
programs and so again this is a part of

1485
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:11,039
this conversation that's still evolving

1486
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:24,390
final question because enforcement

1487
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:26,789
continues to be robust so it's been

1488
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:28,949
interesting and I have to say that it's

1489
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:31,019
been an eye-opening experience to again

1490
01:05:28,949 --> 01:05:33,899
transition from being a community

1491
01:05:31,019 --> 01:05:37,980
organizer agitator to being a regulator

1492
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:39,389
and a general manager so similarly you

1493
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,949
know when I talk to principals I'm

1494
01:05:39,389 --> 01:05:43,529
talking to the police chief I'm talking

1495
01:05:40,949 --> 01:05:45,809
to the fire chief I'm talking to the

1496
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:47,550
city attorney and having all of these

1497
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:52,460
these conversations about how we move

1498
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:52,460
this conversation forward I think that

1499
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:58,320
LAPD doesn't want to be generally out

1500
01:05:56,219 --> 01:06:01,199
there banging out hammers they recognize

1501
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:03,780
that it's not you know politically

1502
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:05,849
appealing to go on a bunch of raids

1503
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:11,010
that's not as exciting as it may have

1504
01:06:05,849 --> 01:06:12,809
been in the early 2000s right yeah it's

1505
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:15,900
not as sexy as it as it was in the in

1506
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:17,610
the early in the early 2000s but at the

1507
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:20,750
same time community members are very

1508
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:22,710
much concerned about dispensaries

1509
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:26,730
primarily dispensaries in their

1510
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:28,559
community and you know for what I

1511
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:31,769
imagine is for a local government it

1512
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:34,219
must be very frustrating to have this

1513
01:06:31,769 --> 01:06:36,300
kind of constantly escape your grasp

1514
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:39,119
community members come up to you and say

1515
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:40,800
you know what are you doing about this

1516
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:43,199
dispensary that's in my neighborhood I

1517
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:45,450
personally complain five times a week

1518
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:48,689
I've been doing this for the last two

1519
01:06:45,449 --> 01:06:51,659
years you shut them down they opened up

1520
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:53,070
next door and now they're expanding you

1521
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:55,589
know that that has to be very

1522
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:58,800
frustrating for law enforcement and so

1523
01:06:55,590 --> 01:07:01,230
while at the same time I personally

1524
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,560
experienced that no LAPD does not want

1525
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:04,740
to

1526
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:06,599
go and do a bunch of raids and

1527
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:08,879
particularly it's the same people it's

1528
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:10,079
their gang a Narcotics Unit and so these

1529
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,519
are people who are dealing with things

1530
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,909
that are much more problematic than

1531
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:17,369
cannabis and at the same time if a

1532
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:19,859
community member has a real issue that

1533
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:21,989
issue should be able to be addressed and

1534
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:23,430
so I think that part of what the city of

1535
01:07:21,989 --> 01:07:25,699
Los Angeles has been doing what the

1536
01:07:23,429 --> 01:07:28,500
department has been doing

1537
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:31,169
we have been facilitating a conversation

1538
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,420
about enforcement in the city where on a

1539
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:35,610
regular basis I have calls with the head

1540
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:38,849
of the gang and Narcotics Unit every

1541
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:40,470
Tuesday we meet on a regular basis with

1542
01:07:38,849 --> 01:07:42,869
the City Attorney's marijuana

1543
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:43,980
Enforcement Unit Fire Department

1544
01:07:42,869 --> 01:07:45,569
Building and Safety who would normally

1545
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:47,130
going for code compliance and we're

1546
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:50,220
having a real and transparent

1547
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:52,680
conversation around you know everything

1548
01:07:50,219 --> 01:07:54,599
we've been doing in the past it's not

1549
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:57,299
necessarily working you know we're

1550
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:58,679
playing this game of whack-a-mole so so

1551
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,810
how do we figure out something that's

1552
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:03,029
going to be sustainable because a lot of

1553
01:08:00,809 --> 01:08:04,619
times when were when we're making these

1554
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:07,880
arrests were also arresting primarily

1555
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:09,750
employees and so you know my

1556
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:11,579
recommendation has been with there

1557
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:13,199
really does need to be one this

1558
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:15,029
educational effort so that folks know

1559
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,789
very clearly what's legal and what's

1560
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:20,010
illegal activity and namely that random

1561
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:21,720
and and it's frustrating for folks it's

1562
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:23,270
still new for folks but the truth of the

1563
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:25,380
matter is if you want to engage in

1564
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:27,510
operate a business you need a state

1565
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:29,190
license and local authorization period

1566
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:30,539
and I know that a lot of people

1567
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:32,879
particularly folks who haven't been

1568
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:34,588
licensed yet that that puts a sour taste

1569
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,270
in your mouth but that's where we are

1570
01:08:34,588 --> 01:08:39,329
and I think that that type of

1571
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:40,950
educational effort is necessary at the

1572
01:08:39,329 --> 01:08:43,350
same time I think we've got to figure

1573
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:45,720
out a more permanent enforcement

1574
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:48,060
strategy my recommendation again has

1575
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:50,338
been we need target business owners and

1576
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:54,480
we need to target property owners and

1577
01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:58,140
and again property owners have kind of

1578
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:59,399
held the key across the board there are

1579
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,990
people who are looking for legitimate

1580
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:02,729
spaces in the city and they can't find

1581
01:09:00,989 --> 01:09:06,909
legitimate spaces because all of the

1582
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:09,659
illegal shops are using

1583
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:12,510
or using those locations and so again

1584
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:14,409
what can be very complicated

1585
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:17,739
conversations and at the same time I

1586
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:20,710
still I see a real effort being made by

1587
01:09:17,739 --> 01:09:24,189
the City Attorney's Office by LAPD to

1588
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:27,760
make a change in institutionally that is

1589
01:09:24,189 --> 01:09:29,259
progress in itself and and so I think

1590
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:31,150
we're over the course of the next

1591
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:33,670
several months particularly as we report

1592
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:36,759
back to Council on an enforcement

1593
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:39,399
strategy on various cost you'll see this

1594
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,750
conversation being elevated but I don't

1595
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:42,699
think it's a one-size-fit-all

1596
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:45,310
I don't think that it means just

1597
01:09:42,699 --> 01:09:48,250
throwing more money at the at law

1598
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:50,200
enforcement I think that if particularly

1599
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:52,149
if we have an opportunity to reframe

1600
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:54,729
what enforcement looks like for cannabis

1601
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:55,750
I'm very excited about that conversation

1602
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:58,569
because that's a very important

1603
01:09:55,750 --> 01:10:00,699
conversation for us to have you know I

1604
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:02,289
want to make sure that once we if we

1605
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:04,179
flip that switch and say that we've made

1606
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:05,890
a change I want to make sure that that

1607
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:09,070
change means that we don't see the same

1608
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:11,350
disparities that we saw prior to

1609
01:10:09,069 --> 01:10:15,819
proposition 64 so again I think we still

1610
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:19,210
have a lot to figure out but I'm two

1611
01:10:15,819 --> 01:10:22,329
weeks away from having served a year

1612
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:25,539
with the city of Los Angeles and there

1613
01:10:22,329 --> 01:10:38,109
has been considerable progress made so

1614
01:10:25,539 --> 01:10:39,670
I'm excited about that many challenges

1615
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:42,399
in this process but it's good to have

1616
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:44,260
you know cities and regulators that are

1617
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:45,219
working with the industry to solve some

1618
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:47,650
of these challenges that we're all

1619
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:49,869
absolutely and I appreciate everyone's

1620
01:10:47,649 --> 01:10:51,609
time normally I come to these events and

1621
01:10:49,869 --> 01:10:54,430
I have a trail of folks that want to

1622
01:10:51,609 --> 01:10:56,319
communicate afterwards I will leave my

1623
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:58,840
cards but I have to immediately leave

1624
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:01,059
I'm very concerned I've been away from

1625
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:03,850
the office for about two hours and we

1626
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:06,220
went live 45 minutes ago so I've earned

1627
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:07,740
it I've got to get back to home base but

1628
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:12,350
thank you thank you can

1629
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:20,769
