2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,240
if you have this kind of face when I'm

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:17,320
going to pronounce a few words here and

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,118
there like this face U sorry what's

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,359
coming out of this is pretty much you

6
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:25,640
know what it's called it French Canadian

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,160
another word uh people living in

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,159
Montreal not in kbec city so just uh few

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,439
comments on this um pretty much you know

10
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:41,038
I started my career uh from the lab of

11
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:43,238
Dr REM Kiron Dr kirion is known to be we

12
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:47,320
call it you know in Canada The Godfather

13
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:49,479
of uh neurology and of course

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,960
neuroscience and I was working in his

15
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:55,640
lab to get my post duct and of course

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,920
you know I was working on opioids and

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,558
tolerance few days after that I end up

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,239
working FAS up

19
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,519
control uh we were working only and only

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,759
on

21
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:13,079
opioids uh the primary building was here

22
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,959
in Montreal and of course my boss used

23
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:20,280
to be in Stockholm

24
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:23,559
Sweden so 96 at the end of 95 96 we have

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,320
this great opportunity because I was

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,799
really focusing you know like a tunnel

27
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,679
you're in the big Pharma you have a

28
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,720
protein you have a molec you have to

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,520
make it work that's it that's all and of

30
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,719
course that's a tunnel

31
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:42,078
vision um was not quite happy so called

32
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,640
back you know uh Sweden and I say hey

33
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,758
guys we have a kind of a pre- project

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,118
sitting on the shelf sure then I mean we

35
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,599
have something but I don't think you're

36
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:57,399
going to be interested try

37
00:01:51,599 --> 00:02:01,118
me and it was a nice cannabis program I

38
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:05,159
mean we started official in

39
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:09,360
1996 uh that was my baby if you will and

40
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,520
not only that we found with this SP

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,840
molecule

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,599
um let's let's talk about only an Alesia

43
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,200
for

44
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:24,159
now uh that was even better than the

45
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:28,280
opioid we were using in the lab I mean

46
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:31,239
that was impossible to believe and

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,759
until I will Shar your some data with

48
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:38,640
you um there's this nice pattern you

49
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:42,878
know that CBD can provide and not only

50
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:45,199
that I mean this molecule has a

51
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,120
potential that nobody can believe it's

52
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:52,000
really the peak of the

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,280
iceberg so we moved fast forward um and

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
had this another great opportunity you

55
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,800
know unfortunately the Cannabis program

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,878
but that's waso uh uh that can pretty

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,959
much you know that was not only a great

58
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:11,759
molecule we had nice analog you know for

59
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,640
this molecule I mean we were totally

60
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:18,840
n u well but when you merge sometime

61
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:24,598
with mastering control and Z you don't

62
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,598
always win uh technically you never win

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,239
so so from one thing to another I mean I

64
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,798
end up in not

65
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,878
only in Minnesota but of course you know

66
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,400
it was not cold enough for me so I went

67
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:43,239
down to

68
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,840
Colorado um from tax lab that I was

69
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,640
managing in Montreal to different C uh

70
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,840
contract research

71
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:54,279
organization uh it was clear I mean that

72
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,920
there was something to win there and

73
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:01,719
what I mean by that is companies that I

74
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,719
recently work with

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:09,479
200,000 molecule that they have just as

76
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:12,598
CB1 antagonist that doesn't penetrate

77
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,399
The Blood Vein barrier from my previous

78
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:18,759
work I mean an anide at

79
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:23,360
155 we we made you know a lot of

80
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:26,199
modification uh it was really impressive

81
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,319
injected locally injected pretty much

82
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,720
everywhere in the uh in the brain as

83
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,719
well

84
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:39,038
so here we are now I mean recently and I

85
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,600
see my colleague over there

86
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:46,120
nick uh last year I mean in

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,120
2016 we at microsite had pretty much all

88
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,959
the pain models and anxiety model

89
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,478
depression and so on even a PTSD

90
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:59,359
model but at last uh we found someone

91
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,319
via the network of Nick that we said

92
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,080
fine

93
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,918
we can go fast and furious with the c

94
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:10,120
industry uh our lab is a schedule one VA

95
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:12,599
schedule one and pretty much you know

96
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,439
with this Great Adventure in less than

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,680
six

98
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,759
months we end up with a nice compound I

99
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,038
mean that we can you can see

100
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,120
tonight so I think for now I'm going to

101
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:29,240
leave it like this but if you do have

102
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,160
question later on please stop but thank

103
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,310
you very much

104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:40,630
have a great even

105
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:40,629
