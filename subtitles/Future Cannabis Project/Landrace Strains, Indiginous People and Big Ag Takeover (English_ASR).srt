2
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:12,919
my question goes back to the theme of

3
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:15,739
today's talk which is the preservation

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:18,289
of land rinses there seems to be out of

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:22,570
prohibition into this becoming more of a

6
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:25,868
medically accepted therapeutic agent to

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:30,198
almost like a green rush towards

8
00:00:25,868 --> 00:00:32,570
crossing land rinses with other strains

9
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:36,230
to then achieve a certain outcome with

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,518
certain pathology or with that said just

11
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:40,219
to use your example sir a little bit

12
00:00:37,518 --> 00:00:42,140
earlier with green house medical you see

13
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:44,238
these companies these genetic banks

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,518
going to places like Congo and Brazil in

15
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,099
Colombia in taking these land dresses

16
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:51,829
and then patent that knowledge later so

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,018
that the indigenous people that have

18
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:57,048
been growing this for me for thousands

19
00:00:54,018 --> 00:01:02,929
of years are now having to buy this back

20
00:00:57,048 --> 00:01:05,390
from the rich world so with all the

21
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:07,489
amazing benefits that preserving these

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,099
land rinses bring to us how can we also

23
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:11,358
ensure that when you think of the war on

24
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:13,968
drugs and the people disproportionately

25
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:16,938
affected by this this prohibition don't

26
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:19,218
suffer because we are so busy preserving

27
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:22,728
them that we're actually extinguishing

28
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:27,199
them by crossing them III do tissue

29
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:28,519
cultures of all of my genetics I have

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,728
two refrigerators that are completely

31
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,709
filled and I will keep them preserved

32
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:36,590
for as long as possible and I have a

33
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:38,239
hundred and thirty two of the listed

34
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,499
four hundred and ninety eight you know

35
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,929
strains that are available and we we do

36
00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:51,589
do breeding and we do that intentionally

37
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:54,950
to zero in on effectiveness okay a prime

38
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,840
example for you is I brought back a pure

39
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,700
Afghani when I came home from the Marine

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,450
Corps we won't have too much of a

41
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:06,289
conversation about that but it was the

42
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,759
the best pain reliever down to earth

43
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:12,439
pain reliever that I ever ever grew and

44
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,378
the one problem that I was having was

45
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:16,818
okay it's let's simplify it a person

46
00:02:15,378 --> 00:02:19,370
who's in pain 24 hours a day is

47
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:23,149
predisposed to be an

48
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,930
they're always in pain okay so what if

49
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:30,020
you could take away their pain and

50
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,310
change their attitude because if you can

51
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,459
change the attitude then you bring the

52
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:37,430
socialization back which communication

53
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,930
and community help to rebuild and

54
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,760
regenerate and rehabilitate the

55
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,099
individual not that you have to hold

56
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,989
that person up or hold their hand okay

57
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:48,229
it's just through common communication

58
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:51,950
so we took a pre 79 euphoria which was

59
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:54,939
known for taking a woman who can go from

60
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:58,459
zero to in three seconds and

61
00:02:54,939 --> 00:03:02,269
turning that switch off so that she

62
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:06,400
becomes mom again you know or that that

63
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:10,069
person who is suffering from you know

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,519
PTSD type issues that snap to judgment

65
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:15,859
or snap to reaction to what you see you

66
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,599
know happening around you so the idea of

67
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,500
it was was take away the pain and

68
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,539
changed the attitude

69
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,049
well we achieved that goal in creating

70
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:25,969
the you Gani and that was crossing those

71
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:30,530
two strains both of which are land race

72
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:32,419
trains and then leaving it alone we left

73
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,099
it alone after that but what we found

74
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:36,259
was that it actually worked for a sight

75
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:39,108
sound odor / alertness / awareness and

76
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:42,439
paranoia in a veteran giving the

77
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:47,390
individual back but getting rid of the

78
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:49,489
symptoms of all of the PTSD so it's

79
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:51,798
there's a certain point where you should

80
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,750
cross you know and try and find an

81
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,250
effective change but there's also a

82
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,219
certain point that you should allow it

83
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,689
to go it's a thing should not after

84
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:02,568
think something's been crossed

85
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:05,539
you know you cross it back to and ensure

86
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:08,358
that you have a stabilized Fino out of

87
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:10,129
it and then at that point there do

88
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:12,620
testing you know so when you find

89
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:14,659
something that works test it on other

90
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,668
people that have the same type of issues

91
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:18,858
and see what the reactions are as

92
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:22,699
growers what you should be doing when

93
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:25,279
you take a strain into a dispensary take

94
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:27,709
a little make little cards okay so that

95
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,629
when a patient goes in and get your

96
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:32,180
product and takes it home that there's

97
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:33,288
ten questions on there and you tell them

98
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,788
listen if you

99
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:37,908
are all these honestly and you bring

100
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:39,168
this back in or mail this out to us okay

101
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:42,288
the next time you go in you're gonna get

102
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:44,568
10% off or 20% off of your product but

103
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:46,938
over a 30-day period of them testing

104
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:50,718
your medicine you can actually pinpoint

105
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:52,610
what works and what doesn't work but

106
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:54,228
what you're gonna find is that by going

107
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:59,990
back to the original land raced range

108
00:04:54,228 --> 00:05:01,639
you can actually target better so the

109
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:07,550
other part of that to answer your

110
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:10,908
question the land races have a whole lot

111
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,800
of history and have been used by Wiseman

112
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:16,728
and medicine man from my part of the

113
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,819
country of the world to China so to go

114
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:21,318
back to that gives you a reference and

115
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,789
sort of like the Sun on demand takes you

116
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,278
back to the Sun which is your reference

117
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:27,318
and if you can get the terroir there's

118
00:05:25,278 --> 00:05:28,129
your reference and if you come with a

119
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,990
genetics

120
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,658
there's your reference you're somewhere

121
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,538
there the hybrids that have come about

122
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:41,088
is because it's called resistance

123
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:43,878
farming right because you're resisting

124
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:45,800
nature as you go when you go indoors

125
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:48,169
you're resisting nature so you have to

126
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,478
do something else so now you've got to

127
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:53,149
take an Afghan and you've got a 28-day

128
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,430
cycle I need to make money so you know

129
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:58,579
what limit how do you think og cush came

130
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,528
along right because somebody wanted to

131
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:02,180
make money they wanted a short cycle and

132
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:08,329
they wanted to get a high so it's not

133
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:11,088
all about THC it's not about THC it's

134
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:13,098
about full plant extract it's about the

135
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:14,949
ensemble effect gives you know what that

136
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:17,628
plant has figured it out already you

137
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,550
trying to screw up in there you trying

138
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:21,580
to go in there and try to do extractive

139
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,228
and all that trying to be a farmer

140
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:26,868
pharmaceutical company again is totally

141
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:29,628
excuse my French but it totally

142
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:31,490
because you're poisoning the

143
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:33,860
people you're cutting your own business

144
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,069
and you're shortchanging you you're sure

145
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,848
damn we can't look in the mirror now so

146
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:43,129
let's go back to that so what hopefully

147
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:46,248
we're trying to do here is to talk about

148
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:47,419
how do you create your own medicine for

149
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:49,909
your page

150
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:53,359
how do you differentiate yourself in the

151
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:55,218
marketplace as a small farmer empower

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,610
yourself instead of trying to be like

153
00:06:55,218 --> 00:07:00,618
everybody else in the grow find medicine

154
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,049
that you want to grow that you have in

155
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:05,569
your heart that you would like to solve

156
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:07,638
a lot of the growers that we talked to

157
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:09,919
had personal experience Harry Rose would

158
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,809
treat well although things went awry for

159
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:17,139
him in his business model he's back

160
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:20,959
again as rosette down in California he

161
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:23,869
was saved by his own balanced tincture

162
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,908
and that's why he's here so every I'm

163
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:30,229
sure most of you have stories of people

164
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:32,178
you've helped or you helped yourself get

165
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:34,579
that medicine the one that you feel the

166
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:36,618
most passionate about and make it as

167
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,389
best as you can you're gonna blow away

168
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:41,649
everybody people can find their way to

169
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:47,209
you if you do that in a very natural way

170
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:49,278
even if it's indoors sorry yeah I just

171
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:52,098
wanted to answer your your question and

172
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:54,348
it's true of intellectual property from

173
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:57,139
indigenous people around the world is

174
00:07:54,348 --> 00:08:01,248
yeah it's being taken and being used

175
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:02,838
commercially and so it's that this has

176
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:04,699
been happening across the amazon basin

177
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:08,629
where pharmaceuticals coming in and

178
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:10,908
finding these plant medicines and it's

179
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:13,278
we're not just facing it's not just

180
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:15,168
about preserving small farms here in

181
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:17,808
Oregon or in California but it's across

182
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:20,838
the world women have been cultivating

183
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:23,269
this medicine they have been getting its

184
00:08:20,838 --> 00:08:26,418
it's been allowing their children to to

185
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:29,449
go to school and that still we need to

186
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:32,718
keep those small farmers around the

187
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:36,038
world alive and and preserve that and

188
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,839
with that I don't really know exactly

189
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:41,568
what the answer is around around

190
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,399
genetics and around I mean it's I don't

191
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:45,620
want to see a surf system where it's

192
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,509
like okay we come and take your genetics

193
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,610
then we sell it back to you and then you

194
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:51,500
grow for us oh now you can make a living

195
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:56,240
because you grow for us and that model

196
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:57,828
cannot it may not be the right one part

197
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,899
of these genetics they're entering

198
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,199
commercialism for the first time these

199
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:02,090
land

200
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,370
races these were grow and not intended

201
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,139
for money not whatsoever it was used for

202
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,360
spiritual healing it was used for

203
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:11,600
healing people in this clash with

204
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,950
commercialism is it's it's it's very

205
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:22,040
real and it's something that we should

206
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:24,560
all be thinking about well I mean it's

207
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:27,169
pretty obvious that that I that we all

208
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,479
agree we want to have great genetics we

209
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:32,029
want to have great light you know we

210
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,740
want to have natural soils I mean it

211
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:38,449
just makes sense to do it that way and

212
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:40,220
and I I just I'm always so impressed

213
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,290
when I come to a talk like this and I

214
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,090
listen to people and you know I have my

215
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:45,829
stupid ideas and then I hear somebody

216
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,950
you know we find it make it even better

217
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:51,020
and and you know this is this is what's

218
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,570
so cool about this industry that I don't

219
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:56,090
think we'll ever see the big guys doing

220
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,470
we get together we share information you

221
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,090
know I was like that I always like to

222
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,000
say we're a bunch of we're just one big

223
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,950
cell you know and we're all enzymes in

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,379
here and we're all helping build a cell

225
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,060
better and that's what we do and and and

226
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:10,460
it doesn't matter whether you make money

227
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:13,639
or not what matters is that you grow the

228
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,180
best plant possible because that's what

229
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,929
it's all about

230
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:19,909
we're supposed to be growing the best

231
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:24,449
plants possible so let's go forth and do

232
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:27,600
it I just

233
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:30,810
I just wanted to add to this conflict

234
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,659
between between commercialism Indian

235
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:35,879
farmers and that is is that this this

236
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,230
culture of gifting and sharing is with

237
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,929
the home grower and we should be

238
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:48,629
encouraging and be helping everyone home

239
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:52,979
grow okay so I'm gonna answer that so I

240
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:55,528
have a new book coming out on

241
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,079
autoflowering cannabis because I think

242
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:59,909
that now that we've got the stigma going

243
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,849
away and it's becoming legal in all the

244
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:04,679
states and in Canada and Bolivia and

245
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,839
everyplace else it's the next tomato

246
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:10,019
this is the plant that my mother will

247
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,209
grow when snap peas came out what I say

248
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,980
is is once or twice in a lifetime a new

249
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:17,219
plant is developed for the home gardener

250
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,659
snap peas oh my god now there's 15

251
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,019
different kinds of snap and I might add

252
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:23,759
I think it started right here in Oregon

253
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:26,399
autoflowering cannabis gives you the

254
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,250
ability to grow from from seed to to

255
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,159
flower harvested seven to nine weeks

256
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,629
that's tough and you if you fertilize it

257
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,120
too much you screw up the soil food web

258
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:37,500
too much they don't grow well holy crow

259
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,149
it's a plant that needs to be ignored

260
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,370
and assent to give it natural conditions

261
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:43,740
it does phenomenal they've improved the

262
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,028
genetics now that we've got lights and

263
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,129
things that we can even leave and make

264
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:50,129
them even better this is the plant that

265
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:52,769
my mother my sisters I don't have a

266
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:54,778
sisters will grow at home because it's

267
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,879
just like a tomato plant so it's coming

268
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:59,509
folks and the home gardener we need to

269
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,509
support so

270
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:11,709
