[Music]

2
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:31,829
you taking me you taking anger I need to

3
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:41,010
study the Maccabiah life of everyone

4
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:44,218
spots where I I collect the genetic we

5
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:48,390
call it a nightclub your life is it's a

6
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:54,030
second science of this I mean I to a

7
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:57,780
level I understood like the power of

8
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:07,500
Zeus my home but I didn't understand

9
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:09,420
that the little illegally glades yeah

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,760
but that's nutrient it's not the

11
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,240
microbes that brags on neutrons you see

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,478
what I mean no but the nutrients are

13
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:24,899
processed by the microbes in the soil

14
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:27,239
right the microbes are in the soil but

15
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,009
you add to them and then you put in your

16
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,769
compost tea which has the ingredients

17
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,829
that you have and that will be processed

18
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:37,949
in a way that will change so this is the

19
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:41,699
you know you told me you you taught me

20
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,680
about the story I say hi Cody according

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,500
to science it's and my clubs that do

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,380
like when we're in in France when you

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,930
say there well there is the terroir the

24
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:54,959
longer climate genetic and the farmer

25
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,950
but there is a terroir the test the test

26
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,949
of that place and

27
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,170
for a long time they take what couldn't

28
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:08,399
be pretty like chihuahuas navel proves

29
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,679
at your plant ability to capture a sense

30
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,889
of the other place and then when I

31
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,719
started to look all that stuff Ottawa I

32
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:19,409
found out that actually they are the

33
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,419
behind the the breaking down further and

34
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:24,689
they realized that is actually the

35
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:27,119
Maccabiah life from the soil that define

36
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:29,639
the cat because if I get soil from under

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,409
the redwood trees or soil from over here

38
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,689
out and a thing or soil from under oak

39
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:36,509
trees it's all different than microbes

40
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:39,449
not the minerals may be the same but the

41
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:42,060
micro imagine in Bordeaux you have field

42
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:42,780
well there is a little der stack in

43
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,569
between

44
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,610
yeah and in between those two well there

45
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,849
is a cell use different in the

46
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:54,300
characteristic over of the wine and it's

47
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:56,549
a little micro here inside so see the

48
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,709
microbes break down the nutrients that

49
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,420
you put in whatever and when they break

50
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,729
them down they make them accessible to

51
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:05,369
the plants right but those are suppose

52
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:08,369
we call those indigenous microorganisms

53
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,830
they're from the place and so in real

54
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,569
regenerative farming you cultivate those

55
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,090
indigenous my coordinates from your

56
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:17,370
local farm yeah but you put you cannot

57
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,620
adapt genetic from abode to that you

58
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,890
need you need to have like maybe not

59
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,200
just a microbial life but you need to

60
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,929
have like a bunch of zoos microbes that

61
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,738
are similar so that the plant can really

62
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:39,060
adapt better well the plant will adapt

63
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:41,610
over time because of the microbes the

64
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,949
genetics yes but the microbes I agree on

65
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:48,680
a percent and we're just really finding

66
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:48,679
out how it actually does that work right

67
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:56,699
the various kinds of bacterium which are

68
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,530
in there and then the fungi fungi and

69
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,599
then the nematodes you know about the

70
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,620
nematodes have you ever seen those on a

71
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,840
Microsoft

72
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,360
the first person I ever saw that was

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:13,750
talking about my cough like I'm talking

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:15,069
about raising so my realization friend

75
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,470
friend she was that there's an old

76
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:18,250
saying in in mystical thing as above so

77
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,960
below

78
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:24,819
right and now I say as above so below

79
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,879
because there's life in that soil in a

80
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:30,250
way that's not just life it's Jeff

81
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:33,069
Lowrance house calls it the livings the

82
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:36,189
soil food web and everything into

83
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:38,829
relates to everything else so the the

84
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:40,509
worm dies or cast off itself summon

85
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:42,728
something eating that shell of the worm

86
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:44,978
the worm poops out and something eating

87
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:47,219
that right and then it dies and then

88
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:49,509
something else eats that and then the

89
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,400
nematode is eating that and they're bad

90
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:53,079
nematodes and good nematodes right and

91
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,448
then some of the fungi go into the root

92
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:58,839
system the key thing for me Frenchy was

93
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:01,960
to realize that the plant roots put out

94
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:05,288
I always thought the plants to suck up

95
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:23,288
which they certainly do but they

96
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:26,110
actually exude they're called eggs as

97
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:30,779
much as it would on the outside with a

98
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:33,160
table or a stack everything that move

99
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:36,429
around the branch is controlled by the

100
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,669
blondie van Hooser protocol whatever

101
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,370
planes are grounded sockets another

102
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:44,500
story is that you give me this I give

103
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,610
you this ooh girl that but thank you

104
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,680
please

105
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,319
there are everything's dropping from

106
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,370
those fees but nobody turns the soil

107
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,759
kills the soil

108
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:57,220
nobody water sit nobody feeds it what

109
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,469
happens it falls on the soil 30 years

110
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,000
later it's all decomposed down because

111
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,250
the microbes have done and then what is

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,769
the plan - it brings it back up again

113
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,978
and it's a total cycle they call it the

114
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:10,959
law of return the plant gives to the

115
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:13,240
soil the soil transforms it through the

116
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,439
microbial life and then the plant and

117
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,269
then reate reacts is again

118
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,689
and so once you have a forest living

119
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:26,509
like that it's self regenitive it feeds

120
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:28,670
itself right the sustainable well

121
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:30,949
actually at the edge of the forest you

122
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,050
have to plan your place as your

123
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:35,930
permaculture to say how do I fit into

124
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,520
this total landscape right there's land

125
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,090
here that's good for this and there's

126
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:45,769
other land that's not good for showing

127
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:48,829
the microbial life in for different type

128
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:52,549
of plant so you can literally use

129
00:06:48,829 --> 00:07:04,219
Michael to go only what you want on your

130
00:06:52,550 --> 00:07:08,600
own bacteria no no but I mean you can

131
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:10,880
you can avoid I think weed or any any

132
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,620
plant that you don't want depending on

133
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:18,279
the microbial life that you have in your

134
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,280
soul right but see if we look at we just

135
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:28,240
yeah same time yeah

136
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,240
well it's got to be Panama

137
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:52,060
like eat whatever I did some workshop in

138
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:58,150
Seattle in and then well a 99% of the

139
00:07:52,060 --> 00:08:02,350
farmer in Washington or Endora me away

140
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:05,139
before that I had seen like one in Spain

141
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:12,129
and one year in Canada doing

142
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:15,250
no chill inside it's pretty I mean I I

143
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:19,329
want to see the whole world of that guy

144
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:22,418
in Spain if you go inside like like all

145
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:27,009
the people out when you see that because

146
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:29,168
it's alive with life and she was exactly

147
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:32,168
the opposite of what you wants to do

148
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:34,509
they want to have a sterile room a

149
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:36,250
totally controlled environment but but

150
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:38,168
now you bring in living soil and you've

151
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,610
got a living environment right you see

152
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:40,149
the thing the reason that the plan

153
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,279
creates

154
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:45,939
terpenes and and try coal and

155
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:47,980
cannabinoids is to protect itself right

156
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,110
and if you're out in they're all open in

157
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,420
natural soil there's many things you

158
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,970
have to protect yourself so they produce

159
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:56,919
a variety of terpenes and many different

160
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,560
kind of cannabinoids to protect

161
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:05,559
themselves and then we use those for the

162
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:07,549
same purpose one game you'll making a

163
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:11,908
cheetah yeah

alpenglow Craig's teetsi ball so - too

166
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:46,990
much - yeah because I don't know

167
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:39,438
yeah Jacob has some of the best weed and

168
00:10:28,249 --> 00:11:07,160
hash around well I think you won Oh what

169
00:10:39,438 --> 00:11:09,438
recently right for the edge a nod oh the

170
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:14,958
pink Sunshine's doing a pink Nepali

171
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:17,319
right now across to the rebel moon it's

172
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:23,299
giving me

173
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:29,530
reminiscent of the mountain man swimmy

174
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:33,349
ad what was that blood well you add its

175
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:36,829
I have neither you know the field in

176
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,620
mallanna like Zeus field in Milan Azalea

177
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:43,360
specific smell that you don't find in us

178
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:47,029
it's all loose food campaign together

179
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,850
here the flower that smelled exactly

180
00:11:47,029 --> 00:12:00,949
like you sleep the first time I smell it

181
00:11:49,850 --> 00:12:05,560
all my ever while back two years back

182
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,560
and I even find the seed that I gave you

183
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:18,179
my first EP yeah it was it was it was

184
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:20,819
being is like when I smell it the first

185
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:23,339
time I was back in the mountain in the

186
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,350
at the end of the valley mallanna in the

187
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,399
middle of the field making Chavez feel

188
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:38,220
like that exact exact up in profile and

189
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:41,970
you know I smell can totally hurry don't

190
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:47,690
taste at all like like what I was making

191
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:47,690
you know there but I had never come even

192
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:03,780
when I first came back to the states in

193
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,580
no.3 well no is actually more like 99

194
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:08,730
and people would say here try this hash

195
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,830
try this hash and I say this is grass

196
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,480
hash you know I mean it's like smelled

197
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,430
like my front lawn you know when I used

198
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,930
to mow it and there's like there was no

199
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:21,059
concept of how to make true fine hash

200
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:23,189
right and of course what's that term

201
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,169
mean is it chatter says you know it's

202
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,500
wet all these different ways to make it

203
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:30,449
now the experimentation is tremendous

204
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,539
between what how many different way

205
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,740
there's resin rosin wax shadow all these

206
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,189
different things it's hard to keep track

207
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:42,509
but for me I still like the dry sift

208
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:44,700
from my from my trim train because it's

209
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:47,399
so different from an extract if you

210
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,740
drink the juice from a foot and you live

211
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,980
beyond the world my takes that create is

212
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,620
the sugar and the juice it's maybe of

213
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,850
the Apple or the the food but it's not

214
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,429
the food anymore

215
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,830
when you take the resin from the resin

216
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:05,009
head from the matrix that created us

217
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:06,690
onward 50-plus cannabinoid and Android

218
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:10,289
50 Pro step and you

219
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:13,410
behind that matrix that created it when

220
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:16,469
I make us that matrix is inside the

221
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:19,259
resume like when you make wine the skin

222
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,930
is inside the juice to be able to make

223
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,330
to share man to do that to add that

224
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:27,209
chemical reaction if you take the juice

225
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:30,690
from the of the grape you can make pure

226
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:32,820
alcohol and well then but you cannot

227
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,640
make wine at all doesn't matter your

228
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,710
take you cannot create the wine if you

229
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,710
don't have the matrix that created the

230
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,990
sugar and the skin of the grape right

231
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:45,030
there's all these microbes and mist and

232
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,519
so on on the skin of the grape yeah and

233
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:53,069
so that's why the full plant has all of

234
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:57,329
that but when you extract you get into a

235
00:14:53,070 --> 00:15:00,330
domain that is so vast and so you can

236
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:03,080
create so many different projects until

237
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:08,070
you have something that is so pure that

238
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:12,840
even Big Pharma I have to to face

239
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:17,340
reality we can actually extract 99.9

240
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:19,950
percent Cannavino heed as isolate and

241
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,170
distillate something that they've been

242
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,730
telling us for 50 years you could undo

243
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:25,620
that's why you needed to do it

244
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:29,789
chemically you know I mean it's like

245
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:32,820
there is a that advanced in in the BH to

246
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:35,639
extraction it's a you teammate mean to

247
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:38,070
capture and separate all those compound

248
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:42,299
and then test them for that right as

249
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:45,510
against when you isolate so far down it

250
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:49,129
become the Western medicine when you

251
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:52,649
start extracting you step out of the

252
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:56,549
entourage effect and you have that world

253
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:59,159
territory of amazing extract and ash is

254
00:15:56,549 --> 00:16:02,609
that in between is like we don't have

255
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:04,250
the 450 compound of the plant that you

256
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,919
we have

257
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,139
any whites faked or move but you know I

258
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:11,209
think I think the cannabis world is big

259
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:14,269
enough for all of that because those

260
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:16,250
isolates are gonna have specific medical

261
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:18,259
use that we're gonna discover right

262
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,289
we're all about the whole planet all

263
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:23,569
100% all that way but I think that there

264
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:25,339
are gonna be we're gonna they're gonna

265
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,840
be able to isolate certain things in

266
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,190
pinpoint and I think that's really

267
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,460
exciting and that's what's happening

268
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,460
here

269
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,850
no it's really exciting that way and in

270
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:41,809
the way they're playing with some things

271
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,159
that is they have to make make it up

272
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:46,279
literally

273
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:50,779
so yeah the cannabis plant could use

274
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:54,709
their friends that everywhere in our not

275
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:57,230
unique to the plant but that depend

276
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:02,090
profile of Android plus their pen most

277
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:06,189
of them you canto cannot quantify that's

278
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,189
unique that you cannot duplicate so

279
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:12,109
that's why I call it the ensemble not

280
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,990
the entourage because all of them are

281
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:16,849
playing right all of them are playing

282
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,609
Entourage it's usually one playing

283
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:26,109
everybody following but the ensemble of

284
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:29,449
a 500 or an orchestra in America it is

285
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:39,169
he told me that when it's in the plant

286
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:41,930
it's the ensemble okay well because in

287
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:48,250
that sense THC is probably leading THC

288
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:55,039
would be the dominant most ancient

289
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:57,769
device that is known basically so we did

290
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,069
a mixture today of a little bit of

291
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:03,619
tobacco and a hash made from Sun Bowl

292
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:08,419
farms grown in humble dry farmed

293
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:10,879
sunshine Johnson yeah so did the rebel

294
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,850
moon for this and then Craig from Alpine

295
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,640
glow to the THC bomb these are both

296
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:20,029
regenerative farms which for me and my

297
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,880
data topped yield and THC and

298
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:24,829
cannabinoid content so it's a huge proof

299
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,110
that you don't need inputs you don't

300
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:33,649
need chemicals and if you just work with

301
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:36,109
nature you can produce the most fire no

302
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:42,710
sorry no commercial synthetic and rights

303
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:46,219
no sunshine she is in a very specific

304
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:48,819
place where she can do dry farming it's

305
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:53,450
not the high farming that define quality

306
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:56,210
she's she's into images with the place

307
00:18:53,450 --> 00:19:00,559
where she is going and she's using that

308
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:02,829
ability to limit totally the water input

309
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:07,559
so that

310
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:10,419
that launch I have to kick into a

311
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:18,369
defensive system and use a lot of

312
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:22,690
laziness well but how long has she been

313
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:25,449
growing there does anyone know this is

314
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:29,710
the fourth year we're doing on the same

315
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:32,200
exact spot but also to make people kind

316
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,779
of understand so it's a flood zone that

317
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,140
place yes yeah every 50 years it's under

318
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:37,329
water

319
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,040
yeah yeah it's also right in between the

320
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:41,079
Avenue of the Giants which are some of

321
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,149
the biggest plants and the biggest

322
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,699
respiratory they're breathing all the

323
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,530
time and they're blowing they're blowing

324
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,420
so much moisture throughout that valley

325
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:52,269
in the morning that yes they're doing

326
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:57,180
your watering for you so it's not like

327
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:57,180
people say oh how can you grow plants

328
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,400
underneath the ground so when you say

329
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,750
what's average used for cannabis you're

330

Frenchie Wow

343
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:09,200
was a big deal in India because when you

344
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:11,628
did they catch the Chilam to the to the

345
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:16,819
God there is a lot of awareness that

346
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:19,339
comes to what you do like that the panel

347
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:25,069
last night we're talking about making

348
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:47,749
the tea in India when you smoke it's a

349
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:49,489
big deal normally the Chilam always goes

350
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:50,960
to the right and you pass with you right

351
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:54,230
and you only take with your right hand

352
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,389
son mud Frenchy kind of honor to me past

353
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,548
it this way and then you have to say

354
00:21:56,388 --> 00:22:05,329
Kali Chilam which is the feminine energy

355
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:20,028
going to the left side but it was all

356
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:29,168
unsaid but can I be spaced on bone in

357
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:46,638
Himalayan Plateau next to the big lake

358
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:48,769
sing like yeah that is like so they find

359
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:51,349
the birthplace of cannabis when it's

360
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:59,778
separated from him you lose 28 million

361
00:22:51,349 --> 00:23:02,209
years ago from the herbs six million

362
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:03,980
years ago it was up to Europe because

363
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,490
there is at cojiro of all the ash

364
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,858
producing country the same climatic only

365
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,069
1 million years ago it went to South

366
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:16,599
China and only 300 70 South

367
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:19,428
who jumped in Malaya and became tropical

368
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:21,609
so that front was a desert plant to

369
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:25,759
start with that way when you are genetic

370
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:28,398
that come from anyway a birth a tropical

371
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,079
country you really need a little water

372
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:32,209
when you have in a place where there is

373
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:37,278
so much water in the air to start with

374
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:46,850
you know I mean like new research on

375
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:49,398
Poland I understand it to you the feet

376
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:53,019
of the Himalaya or China this is and

377
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:56,418
it's next to the oldest evidence of

378
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:59,000
humanity on that continent it's next to

379
00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:02,059
the brows face of cannabis yes 2.1

380
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,190
million years old yeah we've been

381
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:06,589
working with this plant for a long time

382
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,330
and that's its ethnobotany they call it

383
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:10,428
the interaction of the human and and

384
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:12,798
that's to our also the culture of the

385
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:15,409
people creating it right and so that's

386
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:18,679
why we value Afghani hash right or we

387
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:21,019
even say you know Manali right or Kulu

388
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:26,450
Valley and you know can you tell the

389
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:32,359
difference you know the difference

390
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:36,110
between a kulu-manali like I was for a

391
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:39,199
man seen in the Carew in Manali I didn't

392
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:41,689
touch a plant until I was in inter

393
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,710
connect and I didn't want to touch any

394
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:47,480
plant before I was at the place where

395
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:49,970
they're supposed to be the top of the

396
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:54,919
dark I see yeah

397
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:58,548
but Manali before I think nobody thought

398
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:01,370
it was all white can I be Zander the

399
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:03,648
more the demands activated common okay

400
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:05,839
me more Farrell I think it was actually

401
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:08,508
Farrell not really wild because it had

402
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:11,298
been cultivated and then Jen because the

403
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:15,048
Farrell cannabis tends to go 5050

404
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:17,298
usually CBD THC by men it's like what

405
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:24,819
does she come from in yeah it's it's not

406
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:27,349

village as possible in in Milano Valley

430
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:49,259
and and I want to do the jungle

431
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:53,160
interacting for ski weeks alone when I

432
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:56,009
came down I'd still 19:2 in pooja with

433
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:01,710
an Italian house and that Italian dude

434
00:26:56,009 --> 00:27:05,549
was burning chillin was burning chillin

435
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:08,490
in in oven in the morning and I didn't

436
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:12,029
really understand how special it was to

437
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:14,759
share my own jungle I didn't get hit

438
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:17,069
either I didn't understand the value

439
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:18,690
people put into the chill of quality of

440
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:20,700
your children and the quality of your

441
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:24,180
vision that defines the respect that you

442
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,610
receive so because I kicked off my year

443
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,980
jungle all night long with him in the

444
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:30,329
morning if I can get me a chill um but I

445
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,420
did not know that dude

446
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:35,159
so when arriving Manny Callum and I walk

447
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,900
my children with a bunch of Italians

448
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:41,100
they look at me like I had fucking stole

449
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:45,060
the kiss because that's that guy

450
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:48,589
literally chants totally what Chilam was

451
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:57,450
in India I may use a different type of

452
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:59,639
clay this is a very important part of

453
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:02,279
any Chilam smoking you want to clean it

454
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,900
right because that's another thing they

455
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,399
look at your children they pull up the

456
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,530
children's this Chilam clean is this

457
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,110
dude clean right isn't that right it's

458
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:13,769
part of the ritual and so also you look

459
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:15,899
out our fines the police's inside the

460
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:18,750
children right it doesn't to be like a

461
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:24,930
mirror but it's Pawar's so it's gonna

462
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:28,799
absorb a lot of the tar from it no it's

463
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:32,120
only it's only orphaned orphaned to see

464
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,119
for different type of claim

465
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:38,720
yeah episode yeah you won't set

466
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,329
absorption let's see this is the high

467
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,890
art this is the high art of chillin

468
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:44,809
making see because you can get these

469
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,640
little throwaway chillings all over the

470
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:53,450
place that are little tiny one to one or

471
00:28:46,640 --> 00:29:05,690
two people chill them so that's true

472
00:28:53,450 --> 00:29:12,490
that sort of status I suppose it's all

473
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:15,470
about the don't give you that to smoke

474
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,029
when they look at your art they don't

475
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:20,390
know you you need never touch their

476
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:22,099
children it's like and when you knew in

477
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,500
India you don't understand that the

478
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:26,419
world respect that you receive it the

479
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,839
Chilam you have in your on and the

480
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:32,810
quality of the resin you put in even

481
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:35,269
15-20 years all people in in India if

482
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:37,099
you have the goods they're going to give

483
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:39,650
you respect doesn't matter how long

484
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:41,509
you've been in India if you don't have

485
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:44,930
it they don't even give you the time of

486
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:47,089
the day as well it's not very nice

487
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:59,990
actually they are not really welcoming

488
00:29:47,089 --> 00:30:01,909
well it's the caste system yeah you

489
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:07,609
gotta you gotta earn your creds no

490
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:11,210
question about it but how hardcore is it

491
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:16,009
to go up into the mountains like I've

492
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:19,309

502
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,680
there is one pass at 12,000 feet when

503
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:54,109

510
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,319
that but it's the best time in my life

511
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:38,120
the road one point is like

512
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:59,789

was going to change my sermons visa I

515
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:09,029
was supposed to face shortywood here

516
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:14,309
they wanted Saladin would be I am gonna

517
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:17,480
come back to go now the first time at

518
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:21,389
first time I went to Nepal I believe was

519
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,430
70 70 we I was working on a movie called

520
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,680
Sun seed and we were filming various

521
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:28,680
teachers around so we went and filmed at

522
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,380
the swayambhu we filmed the rinpoche at

523
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:35,670
swayambhu with the long trumpets like

524
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:37,470
that woo and they're doing a snapping

525
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:39,660
thing and they're chanting this an

526
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:42,390
amazing chanting and pouring tea it's up

527
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:44,700
on top of the hill there and then I went

528
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:48,480
back a year later but I went over land

529
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,340
from from Amsterdam all the way up to

530
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,860
Nepal again and then I had a house in

531
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:55,649
back of swayambhu and I stayed there for

532
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:57,389
about three months there and every day

533
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:03,150
around the temple around the hill

534
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:04,680
swayambhu hill yeah I wasn't really into

535
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,660
the hash at the point it was just there

536
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,380
I wasn't like you I wasn't seeking out

537
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:13,490
that most rare extreme place I was there

538
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,380
just to be sitting in painting and being

539
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,839
people think that I was going there and

540
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,450
sitting at the feet of the Machine I

541
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:25,939
wasn't going there to make my own that

542
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:29,160
basically it is like so it's like I

543
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:31,170
learned because I you try you walk

544
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:39,870
alongside with the same tour and stuff

545
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:42,150
like that and then the loca but when I

546
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:45,569
came to Indiana the difference was all

547
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:48,840

need to have a lot of material material

579
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:59,179

580
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:01,970
to do ten times all Jews great I'm ready

581
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:06,500
to give it in the neck change for

582
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:09,108
hospital and and that they don't kill me

583
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:12,559
on the price for what I'm making because

584
00:36:09,108 --> 00:36:15,139
that normal is at your stash you know

585

I stay long with them you know I mean so

590
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:42,500
you need to super compensate with your

591
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:44,750
thumb to be able to get that stuff in

592
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,659
India is different in India you

593
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:50,630
literally stick libraries in on your

594
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:53,960
hand like the relation with the plant

595
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:56,539
doing that in the most remote valley of

596
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,490
the Malaya and shit is like it's

597
00:36:56,539 --> 00:37:01,220
different like that was the first time

598
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:04,459
where I had that relation with a blonde

599
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:07,328
I did not understand it it took me a

600
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:10,278
year to come here to understand genetic

601
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:12,490
but I had that strong volition for the

602
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:17,409
first time was that living

603
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:22,169
oh yeah it's I mean burns like everyday

604
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:22,170
bounce after months it like it like it

605
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:30,730
and then what do you do with that you

606
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:32,829
you you you cover them it's all

607
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:40,990
caressing so you're sepia light you you

608
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:45,369
you waste you the jungle the jungle

609
00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:48,098
usually is the season is earlier than

610
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:51,630
anything cultivated so the jungle is

611
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:56,070
like early September to end of September

612
00:37:51,630 --> 00:38:00,490
mid September to the first week of

613
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:03,190
October and then up to end of November

614
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:06,309
you have cultivated sometime even have I

615
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:10,150
had a season where it focused snow like

616
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:12,608
this much but today later it had melted

617
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:15,250
and we didn't finish our field so we

618
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:18,338
went back to see it all the plant were

619
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:20,619
all back up but they were like semi wild

620
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:22,480
plant we let them every year we didn't

621
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:24,820
touch them we let them go back to work

622
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,900
to the wild so they were all standard

623
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:31,630
but they were all burn by the basal snow

624
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,579
so you we had a lot of contaminant you

625
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:42,970
know and that we couldn't separate bunch

626
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:45,309
of make us make them survive survival

627
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:56,259
the species they put out something else

628
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:58,719
when now you have to is sticky but if

629
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:02,109
you have water in your hand it's not

630
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:04,868
gonna stick you don't stick if you have

631
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:07,119
oily and you don't stick if you break

632
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:09,130
the plant and there is water from the

633
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,140
plant and clover files that come in your

634
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,559
hand it's not going to stick the same

635
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:14,170
ASA

636
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:16,570
it's gonna take a while before I was

637
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,090
always like you just catch the prawns

638
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:20,400
the first time

639
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:23,250
you look at your own it's all shiny and

640
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,590
it's cheesy like fucking crazy and then

641
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:29,659
layer blown by plant layer by layer

642
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:32,610
every plant you clean up any any little

643
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:35,339
particulars that stick to it and slowly

644
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:38,430
slowly player and the color start to

645
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:42,690
appear and it got from transfer horns to

646
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:46,699
light on the Ong ahead and then when you

647
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:49,800
have a secret lair its dark almost black

648
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:52,289
then when you have enough and you

649
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,970
careful you see that when you carriage

650
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:56,340
the blonde that is chunk of your ear

651
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:59,699
from your hand that goes out it's time

652
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:02,010
to stop and then you take your Sun you

653
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:04,679
turn it on your hand and you snap it out

654
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:08,970
and all the ash is gonna be on your Sun

655
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:10,949
and then you can stick all your hand it

656
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:13,469
becomes about it's still sticky but it

657
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:17,809
becomes epi wine the most difficult is

658
00:40:13,469 --> 00:40:20,519
actually to don't feel this to your son

659
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:23,599
and then there is two way all you do a

660
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:26,280
finger that means that you hold in your

661
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:30,509
that piece of art so you kept pure

662
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:32,910
whatever is left in your arm or Mia I

663
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,250
like better because but the local did

664
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:38,009
not have plastic in the time I admit I

665
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:40,949
made likes flat pancake into a sink

666
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:43,170
plastic so that there is very little air

667
00:40:40,949 --> 00:40:45,869
that can get in contact with the resin

668
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:48,329
and create more than shit because in any

669
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:51,809
other problem is Molly's are given when

670
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:54,420
your resin is perfectly clean so the

671
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:57,420
mold spore everywhere and they stick to

672
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:00,059
the resin so you have a bunch of finger

673
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,230
super clean but they put them all

674
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:07,679
together into a big

675
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:11,070
but pounder there's a queen you have the

676
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:13,139
merge that is coming only when you bring

677
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:16,490
it to the mountain down in South India

678
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:16,489
right because the temperature change

679
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:21,889
there's a place when you're when you're

680
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,320
molding a hash where at a certain point

681
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:27,480
it changes right the texture changes and

682
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:31,289
the color changes and now it's not it's

683
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,380
like it's light rays in but it does not

684
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:37,650
have it's not like live reason we got

685
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:41,640
from with ice water not at all as much

686
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:46,349
as the high regime - is the same than

687
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:48,690
ice water dry-cured regime life is in in

688
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:51,360
your hand is very different and I've

689
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:54,150
risen from the machine I don't know why

690
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,250
because it's it shouldn't miss the

691
00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:00,180
define never seen new creation in my

692
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:16,289
life and there is 70% humidity easy you

693
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:19,379
know I mean yeah it's easy you mean make

694
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:22,469
like 20 grams a day when T so T or they

695
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,720
can make 5 grams of creme so then to get

696
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:28,709
them to make creme is very hard you need

697
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:32,879
you next to you yeah okay you walk like

698
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:35,760
me you instead of making 20 gram at so

699
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,519
much money you're gonna make only 5 7 10

700
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,850
gram I give you as much money for what

701
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:44,190
oh I had a one time I Chi I wonder with

702
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:46,108
with I mean that was pretty amazing in

703
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:49,289
Marana like it change the perspective

704
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:53,489
and the deal was a guy say everything

705
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:56,219
you make I put out that I buy of I

706
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:58,649
quality on the table and at the end of

707
00:42:56,219 --> 00:43:01,649
the season we go together to New Delhi

708
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:03,450
and I sell it to the foyer of the same

709
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,480
way that I would sell it for me and

710
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:07,179
that's your payment for the for what you

711
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,329
are

712
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:13,719
giving me basically all you have the

713
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:16,150
local people also that come and and do

714
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:18,368
the field around you they know what you

715
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:20,530
want and they know that you're ready to

716
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:22,480
pay for it so they do generally work for

717
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:25,059
you and every night when you got starts

718
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:29,019
they should use their undoing the days I

719
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:32,589
could stay close but no it's a sad

720
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:35,108
situation because thank you

721
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:40,049
before the farmers used to go there and

722
00:43:35,108 --> 00:43:40,049
they had this work word called Cod and

723
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:50,469
and Cod used to mean goat shit now if

724
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:52,779
you go to the mountains and ask them

725
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:56,409
what Cod is they pull out this little

726
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:59,380
pink bag of salts so like it's been

727
00:43:56,409 --> 00:44:00,909
completely destroyed because so many of

728
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,190
the demand for hash is so high

729
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:05,710
especially with India as an economic

730
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:08,318
boom like everybody smokes hash in the

731
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:11,050
cities so now you have these farmers

732
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:14,588
pushed and they're growing with salts

733
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:16,140
and ruining that whole all of those

734
00:44:14,588 --> 00:44:23,440
hills

735
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:26,289
we need worldwide legal to change

736
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,588
everything if you if you bring foreign

737
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:32,769
genetic to a place where the genetic is

738
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:36,548
possibly 1600 and no six hundred and

739
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:39,130
seventy thousand years old it's like

740
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:41,829
you're you're polluting pools either

741
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:45,130
technically speaking it's a national

742
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:47,559
credit treasure and the Indians they

743
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:50,079
won't actually they ask father I had

744
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:53,048
some huge agreement on farm the guy

745
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,940
wanted genetic from here to to bring to

746
00:44:53,048 --> 00:45:00,789
India and I was telling him it's like

747
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:03,338
you have vast source of amazing and

748
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:06,009
unique genetic India and you want to

749
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:09,578
bring something for end that is based

750
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:11,290
the I know predation or actually long

751
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:13,630
race and you want to bring that there

752
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:14,650
and pollute something that is unique to

753
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,710
your present

754
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:19,809
man you don't get it and they don't it's

755
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:21,429
because this is a market in Europe they

756
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:25,000
want to they want to do the same they

757
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:27,849
want to smoke the same well the Indian

758
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,909
government is now actually trying to do

759
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:32,559
a landrace catalog and they're about to

760
00:45:30,909 --> 00:45:34,629
start doing that and one of the things

761
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,059
is for that whole thing with the genetic

762
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:38,829
markers right but they want to make sure

763
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:40,989
that they get land races that are still

764
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:45,279
existing not just in him all but in

765
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:46,179
Orissa and also not time on Andrew but

766
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,920
Andhra Pradesh

767
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:51,669
there's also traditional cannabis

768
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,639
growing areas right and so right and so

769
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:56,289
but they're still hung up on the 0.3%

770
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:59,170
they're still they're only gonna stake

771
00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:00,880
stuff that's 0.3% and then they they

772
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:07,450
sort of don't get it right about full

773
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:10,090
plant right is level of THC is like from

774
00:46:07,449 --> 00:46:13,269
the old ash I was smoking when I was

775
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:16,780
young there is a scientist in Israel

776
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:22,150
they did a study on ten years of bursts

777
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:25,930
in his a Moroccan Lebanese an Indian and

778
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:28,900
it was from the 1992 the 2000 so it's

779
00:46:25,929 --> 00:46:31,329
not too far for my time to be a huge

780
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:36,160
difference between what I was smoking in

781
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:39,190
France and and Zeus bursts Lebanese is

782
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:42,869
basically a one on one CBD THC and it

783
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:47,829
has a pretty low level of THC they were

784
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:51,639
seeing only looking only at thecb CBD

785
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:53,289
and CBN it's like four percent THC so

786
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:56,289
they're telling me that the fucking red

787
00:46:53,289 --> 00:47:00,219
Lebanese that I remember forty five

788
00:46:56,289 --> 00:47:02,610
years later was only four percent THC is

789
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:11,529
like it's cracking me up

790
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:15,130
Malkin two to one is a Malkin - are you

791
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:17,200
a percentage of THC and CBD and in India

792
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:21,130
is basically five to one there's a lot

793
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:24,609
more THC but like from the mountains the

794
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:27,630
chalice is like fourteen percent THC for

795
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:31,840
TM so it's like I

796
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:34,180
but even even even if it's not the

797
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,660
greatest of the greatest it show very

798
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:40,569
much emerge the entourage effect

799
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:43,539
actually give power to to the ash with

800
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:46,390
smog because there is no way I was

801
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:49,420
smoking a one on one focus on THC and

802
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:52,299
still be raving about it so many years

803
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:54,039
later I dream to smoke already bunnies

804
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,380
you know what I mean it's like there is

805
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:59,019
no way that if he didn't have that

806
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:02,910
specific depend profile that he's so

807
00:47:59,019 --> 00:48:02,909
unique you cannot even describe it

808
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:07,449
[Music]

809
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:19,599
we we only made like three four grams

810
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:21,250
super nice it's a super nice high and I

811
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:41,769
don't think there is much we tested it

812
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:44,860
it was a lot of CBD I made a 52% CBD but

813
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:47,559
I never tried them until Milan a months

814
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:53,829
ago when I was a judge I'd sell for the

815
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:56,799
ash made from I CBD almost 0.3 percent

816
00:48:53,829 --> 00:49:01,559
THC so the first time I smoked false

817
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,560
belief you know in the morning clean

818
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:10,660
this is science I appreciate your

819
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:15,219
dedication here come on now wait wait

820
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:18,909
what tobacco and CBD what yeah is pure

821
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:21,339
hash okay so I I wake up in the morning

822
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:24,099
I have a bunch of aches and pain and

823
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:28,059
shit I had never feels such a really

824
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:32,559
well beingness bujji release but like

825
00:49:28,059 --> 00:49:35,769
it's like a it's like a curtain that

826
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,380
that comes early sorry Daniel your body

827
00:49:35,769 --> 00:49:41,300
and it's well beingness and you have a

828
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,789
birth but it's a birth of

829
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:46,160
feeling so good in your body magically

830
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:51,529
it's not the birds per se but is like on

831
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:53,389
the budgets gotta let me see well is it

832
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,250
is your cannabinoid system your

833
00:49:53,389 --> 00:49:58,789
endocannabinoid system that the CBD

834
00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:06,289
somehow comes in and like dances with

835
00:49:58,789 --> 00:50:08,059
and it's just that Western science

836
00:50:06,289 --> 00:50:10,009
always wants the isolate it says this

837
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:11,750
there's only this and there's only that

838
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:14,050
and you know it's not it's about

839
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:17,809
everything that's in there at the point

840
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:20,150
it's fascinating because like before we

841
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:22,159
were just making us like in in yeah you

842
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:24,619
just make ash and you don't really know

843
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:28,819
what's inside then I learned what was at

844
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:30,920
icon and I learned what actually was the

845
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:34,309
cannabinoid and how they transform into

846
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:37,159
each other so now as an ash maker I have

847
00:50:34,309 --> 00:50:39,590
the ability to put a pure CBD ash on the

848
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:43,849
market because I can transform the THC

849
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:47,210
in CBN I can manipulate I can manipulate

850
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:49,369
Canobie know it because I know them and

851
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:53,000
because there is so much diversity in

852
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:57,829
the plant instead of having one type of

853
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:01,639
ash now I have ithc ash and everything

854
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:04,190
from one on one to fifty to one CBD all

855
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:06,379
those ashes like it's it's a new

856
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:13,820
territory for us maker it's like it's

857
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:16,430
very trippy what what microscope you saw

858
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:20,440
the trichomes the first time that was

859
00:51:16,429 --> 00:51:20,440
like no seriously this is a revelation

860
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:32,960
even on hash you see the right the

861
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:35,809
moment that I did you you know Mila in

862
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,639
Amsterdam right so I'm in her shop right

863
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:39,949
and she knows me as a and all these

864
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:42,379
people from Manali and all that said so

865
00:51:39,949 --> 00:51:44,179
I'm with Mila right and she and she says

866
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,039
here you don't know nothing about this

867
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:47,899
stuff it's not marijuana it's cannabis

868
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:51,230
she says right and then she says here

869
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:53,450
look at this and I was like wow

870
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:54,170
right you have these try cones and to

871
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:58,689
realize that

872
00:51:54,170 --> 00:52:03,170
the stuff there because that Pollan yeah

873
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:05,510
yeah it's like and it's like oh can you

874
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:08,000
understand what you're doing if you

875
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:11,000
don't understand all the project when

876
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,960
for me all those years in in producing

877
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,559
country it was to make my own basically

878
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,190
so it was it was not a pastime it really

879
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,380
it was very very very special time

880
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:27,590
dedicated to my well-being as for the

881
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:30,410
year but it wasn't really serious it

882
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:33,079
becomes I use when I came here and it

883
00:52:30,409 --> 00:52:36,109
became a craft well there is a project

884
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:38,210
and the children there is no singers so

885
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:41,300
I knew the tool a lot but I was totally

886
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:45,230
ignorant on the project I was actually

887
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:47,570
walking with it it's like I became

888
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:52,570
better because I know the project I'm

889
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:52,570
working with and so now instead of

890
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:58,330
playing around with a project I have no

891
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:01,250
idea what it is and tools that are

892
00:52:58,329 --> 00:53:05,269
adapted to a certain level but it's very

893
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:09,590
local know I could create my own tool

894
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:11,420
because I'm I know more in depth what

895
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:15,140
I'm actually working with it's like a

896
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:17,119
metal were blacksmiths if you give any

897
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:18,799
blacksmiths titanium to walk and he

898
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,679
doesn't know the property of the new

899
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,780
metal is going to do stuff but he's not

900
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:26,799
going to he's not going to be able to do

901
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:29,240
whatever he can do if he knew really old

902
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,070
took place where everybody works with

903
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:33,939
that metal and then and that's what you

904
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:37,370
did that's what I did we came here to do

905
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:40,400
if you ask a local why why do you cure

906
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:42,409
your flower for three to nine months in

907
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,930
that home the guys make it make good

908
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:47,509
regime why do you press your resin

909
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:49,759
because it made good Ashish and every

910
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:52,490
time it's like that is like they know it

911
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:56,080
for a fact they invented the game but

912
00:53:52,489 --> 00:53:56,079
they cannot tell you why

913
00:53:56,929 --> 00:54:02,739
everything everything they do there is

914
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:04,659
something behind

915
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:06,489
so long worth we're not we're not

916
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:08,799
getting there we're getting there in

917
00:54:06,489 --> 00:54:11,469
mindo and humble of having enough time

918
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,359
and so on but to really dial it we got

919
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:16,118
another hundred years here at least of

920
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:19,480
growing in the finest place because you

921
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:23,588
have science on your is like imagine a

922
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:28,088
farmer that can have the ability and the

923
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:30,940
finance to analyze is sold before a plot

924
00:54:28,088 --> 00:54:33,009
yeah and every month during the world

925
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:35,108
season not only the salt but the plant

926
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:37,570
so that you know exactly what the plant

927
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:39,880
is taking from your soil and you knew

928
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:57,730
before if it's gonna miss something and

929
00:54:39,880 --> 00:55:00,160
for when you see you know I think you've

930
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:04,659
really dialed in your soil and so on and

931
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:07,449
you soil it's become like the edge of

932
00:55:04,659 --> 00:55:10,960
the plant but it's like with a science

933
00:55:07,449 --> 00:55:13,029
you can define why your plant is what

934
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,320
your front is gonna miss because she's

935
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:16,119
taking a lot of it

936
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,910
you know what I mean it's like it's

937
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,858
fucking huge you can you know when you

938
00:55:18,909 --> 00:55:22,629
first realize that the plant needs all

939
00:55:20,858 --> 00:55:24,369
these minerals right it needs not only

940
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:26,380
minerals so but it needs all these

941
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:28,240
different microbes that needs bacteria

942
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,190
and fungi and how do you feed that right

943
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:32,618
and so you start experimenting with

944
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:35,230
compost teas and those compost teas

945
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:36,820
become locally sourced right so the

946
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:39,480
compost tea you're putting on is from

947
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:42,430
your compost that you have right and

948
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,079
your worm bin that you have and now so

949
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:46,719
now the ingredients that are purely

950
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,750
local that you put in do you know

951
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:51,730
exactly what your compost tea do to your

952
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:54,250
so no because you need to analyze your

953
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:56,559
sir you need to use a microscope to look

954
00:55:54,250 --> 00:56:01,420
at well you look at the compost tea with

955
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:03,130
the microscope before you put yeah no

956
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:05,530
for sure yeah well first of all I

957
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:07,630
started doing mineral testing you know

958
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:09,430
and that's the Nano NPK and all of that

959
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,930
and then you realize wow there's 14

960
00:56:09,429 --> 00:56:13,029
things did you know your plant needs

961
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:16,690
molybdenum does anybody know what

962
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:19,000
molybdenum is right and so it needs man

963
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:21,670
and magnesium and copper and sulfur and

964
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,289
all these sort of things those are all

965
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:25,539
heavy metals right and normally in

966
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:28,329
regular commercial agriculture they

967
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:30,338
delivered as a salt right and so they're

968
00:56:28,329 --> 00:56:32,289
more easily absorbed in the water when

969
00:56:30,338 --> 00:56:34,809
you water it in but now if you want to

970
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:36,519
do regenerative soil then you don't use

971
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:39,369
those things you make those ingredients

972
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:42,519
with your compost tea which is like a

973
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:44,680
little bit of stay comfrey in there not

974
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:46,809
come free but alfalfa you might put in

975
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:49,358
there and you put in some some worm

976
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:56,199
castings and you put in some compost and

977
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:59,380
a few other things and alfalfa alfalfa

978
00:56:56,199 --> 00:57:02,259
is like 4 to 1 like that alfalfa it's

979
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:08,710
got a fair amount of nitrogen all right

980
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:10,210
and a lot of things what people do with

981
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:14,318
that because those are more minerals

982
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:16,960
right then you get what is volcanic ash

983
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:25,269
azomite something like that which is has

984
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:26,650
trace minerals and some weeds are

985
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:28,929
something that thrives in that

986
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:31,838
environment right and if you can tune

987
00:57:28,929 --> 00:57:33,759
into what it's got they smell something

988
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:35,588
like hope your G's that tell you that

989
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,839
you don't need to give anything actually

990
00:57:35,588 --> 00:57:39,849
to your plowed everything is in your

991
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:42,849
soil but you don't have the microbial

992
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:49,300
life to break it down yeah like Ellen

993
00:57:42,849 --> 00:57:52,359
she's called you all at the living soil

994
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:55,300
in ambled she's called all the thumb and

995
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:58,659
only only elk and you can do it because

996
00:57:55,300 --> 00:58:04,560
she's her style and she the worksheet

997
00:57:58,659 --> 00:58:08,429
that we are fucking up your your so

998
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:11,650
babysitting Zeus plant or your so

999
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:16,899
pushing what you give to Zeus blown that

1000
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:19,660
it almost ridiculous to a certain level

1001
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:21,880
when she show you table of everything

1002
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:24,489
that is available for you right there

1003
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,829
and you just need to put my clog to

1004
00:58:24,489 --> 00:58:29,419
break it down so that your you I mean

1005
00:58:26,829 --> 00:58:32,369
look at the things that are going

1006
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:34,619
you know everyone's like you love it

1007
00:58:32,369 --> 00:58:37,739
actually I have to go and set up

1008
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:41,450
something so adaptogen et tu to the

1009
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:41,449
condition of the place where they live

1010
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:53,998
but for example not putting back the

1011
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:56,400
prolongs matter where the next

1012
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:58,639
generation is going to go like it's done

1013
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,548
in Nigeria I think that's a big mistake

1014
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:05,190
not leaving the greater seeds in the

1015
00:59:02,548 --> 00:59:08,190
soil during winter I think it's a big

1016
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:10,739
mistake here you have such a devious

1017
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:13,979
city and the planter adapted but they

1018
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:16,650
are still not local local because you

1019
00:59:13,978 --> 00:59:19,848
don't give them the chance to become

1020
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:22,858
really heirloom to spend the winter to

1021
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:26,219
to go through the world sidecar real

1022
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:28,409
cycle of a plant life and then you're

1023
00:59:26,219 --> 00:59:46,499
gonna create heirloom genetics that

1024
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:49,889
gonna become no no because you have that

1025
00:59:46,498 --> 00:59:55,308
first tier of flower that is born and

1026
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:57,958
the ability to get credit for the

1027
00:59:55,309 --> 01:00:02,849
biomass that just doesn't go to the

1028
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:05,969
flower market and that biomass it's the

1029
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:09,778
credit of doesn't matter if it could

1030
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:19,259
become a bloody chocolate of a pain bowl

1031
01:00:09,778 --> 01:00:22,349
of for me anybody me and you three need

1032
01:00:19,259 --> 01:00:26,748
the farmer to strive so that we can get

1033
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:26,749
the stuff we need okay very simple

1034
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:39,268
community that is hiding well the rest

1035
01:00:37,409 --> 01:00:41,248
of the rest of the youngest

1036
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:44,218
not going to be nice taping the future

1037
01:00:41,248 --> 01:00:46,348
the civilization is built on thriving

1038
01:00:44,219 --> 01:00:48,929
agriculture you know the way we have it

1039
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:51,028
and our cultivation artists cannabis

1040
01:00:48,929 --> 01:00:54,599
civilization is built on thriving

1041
01:00:51,028 --> 01:00:56,938
farmers and you know we came here we

1042
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:59,669
came here in order to you know learn

1043
01:00:56,938 --> 01:01:02,368
from each other and a situation which we

1044
01:00:59,668 --> 01:01:04,768
had an isolation here so nobody was

1045
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:06,719
bothering us and our seeds came in from

1046
01:01:04,768 --> 01:01:08,578
all over the world and people came in

1047
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:11,369
from all over the world and the progress

1048
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:13,019
that has been made in genetics now and I

1049
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:14,969
do have to say we all a lot to the

1050
01:01:13,018 --> 01:01:16,738
indoor growers to who really figured out

1051
01:01:14,969 --> 01:01:18,659
a lot of the science they had to figure

1052
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:20,249
if there's nothing in that they got they

1053
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:22,709
had to figure out what is this plant

1054
01:01:20,248 --> 01:01:24,058
need and so we know how that data and it

1055
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:25,858
turns out to be just about what every

1056
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:27,749
other plant really needs but you can

1057
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:29,159
dial is specific for cannabis but what

1058
01:01:27,748 --> 01:01:31,738
we really the whole basis of our

1059
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:36,659
conversation is really about the place

1060
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:39,449
where you grow it and that place about

1061
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:41,278
the product from that place and I

1062
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:43,499
remember your telling me in the past

1063
01:01:41,278 --> 01:01:45,809
that every plant that we see on the

1064
01:01:43,498 --> 01:01:48,988
planet originated in one particular

1065
01:01:45,809 --> 01:01:51,689
place which is its terroir its original

1066
01:01:48,989 --> 01:01:53,938
home but now through our interaction

1067
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:55,888
with with plants as humans especially

1068
01:01:53,938 --> 01:01:59,969
this cannabis when it's at home in many

1069
01:01:55,889 --> 01:02:02,789
many places and so but we're trying to

1070
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:04,798
make it more at home we want to make it

1071
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:07,109
more an expression of every place that

1072
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:09,358
it really is and so that we're now

1073
01:02:07,108 --> 01:02:11,818
working on this appellations project to

1074
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,708
try and it's very controversial and a

1075
01:02:11,818 --> 01:02:16,798
lot of details about it but the idea is

1076
01:02:13,708 --> 01:02:19,469
to create areas of recognition that this

1077
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:24,048
is a traditional cannabis area around

1078
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:26,608
the world making fun of me five yeah I

1079
01:02:24,048 --> 01:02:28,380
was talking about it 10 years ago but

1080
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:30,449
nobody know what the word meant you know

1081
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:32,818
but when you think about an appellation

1082
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:34,709
for some part of Afghanistan or from

1083
01:02:32,818 --> 01:02:36,898
from Manali where you think they will

1084
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:40,798
have protection as the guarantee of this

1085
01:02:36,898 --> 01:02:44,788
again what you don't get swingy is like

1086
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:47,519
you cannot use the world abolition the

1087
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:50,850
regime if you don't follow the

1088
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:52,739
of abolition division yes protected

1089
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:54,750
pagination oh that's what we want to do

1090
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:57,359
we want to be those quality standards

1091
01:02:54,750 --> 01:03:01,530
who have to choice all you follow to the

1092
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:04,079
later the stone division and the wine

1093
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:06,000
industry didn't do it because they

1094
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,920
didn't have an induced fit they didn't

1095
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,170
other wines they needed to create those

1096
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,960
great wines that you have today you you

1097
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:15,539
have so much greatness that zhuzh

1098
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,349
limitation are not the problem at all is

1099
01:03:15,539 --> 01:03:22,289
going to it's going to help you define

1100
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:24,089
everything you have but working with the

1101
01:03:22,289 --> 01:03:26,099
sale at the moment which has a legal

1102
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:28,950
requirement to create standards for

1103
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:31,679
appellation no no no because zoos

1104
01:03:28,949 --> 01:03:39,109
American Standa are not a pollution

1105
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:39,109
division stoned out it's amazing but

1106
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:47,730
because you have to choice oh you do so

1107
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:51,450
a tradition division or you create your

1108
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:54,389
own standards but so all you have some

1109
01:03:51,449 --> 01:03:57,419
things that is valid world wild and it

1110
01:03:54,389 --> 01:04:00,179
would be a breakthrough for agriculture

1111
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:03,000
in general in America all you need to

1112
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:05,759
create something that is as valid as

1113
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,920
that so you can be sure that the rest of

1114
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,050
the world is going to follow the

1115
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,409
standard of quality you have zoos to

1116
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:15,119
choice but you cannot use the word

1117
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:18,029
appellation the region you're gonna be

1118
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:21,090
sued guys it's like Mendocino they

1119
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:23,460
cannot use that world you have or you

1120
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:25,470
play that game but you don't want to

1121
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:28,019
play it so you you are right now you

1122
01:04:25,469 --> 01:04:31,108
need to choose or you create your or

1123
01:04:28,019 --> 01:04:34,320
your one it is a great pass don't get me

1124
01:04:31,108 --> 01:04:36,449
wrong or you follow the path of what

1125
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:39,300
every country in the world when they use

1126
01:04:36,449 --> 01:04:40,889
the word appellation division is because

1127
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:43,590
they have followed to the letter

1128
01:04:40,889 --> 01:04:47,309
every stone the every limitations that

1129
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:49,619
give you that ability to not only create

1130
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:52,949
that level of quality but you cannot

1131
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:54,840
birth improve that level of quality you

1132
01:04:52,949 --> 01:04:59,039
don't want that you kill you need to

1133
01:04:54,840 --> 01:05:00,760
create your own that can be as hope

1134
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,528
hasn't achieve as

1135
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:07,059
what the French did for the wine

1136
01:05:02,528 --> 01:05:08,889
basically it would be only for cannabis

1137

1138
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:14,078

1139
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:17,608

1147
01:05:34,409 --> 01:05:38,848
