1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
someone had asked the question about a

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:07,798
kind of like a nursery you know per

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,388
square foot how what was the question

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,870
that you answered and you just like

5
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:16,589
broke it down oh yeah they were asking

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:19,230
you know how much how much can I get off

7
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:22,019
of an operation and it's basically just

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,250
takes 60% of the operation and call it

9
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,528
call it functional

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,050
this 40% is going to be you know

11
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:29,759
workable movement you know around stock

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,750
if if the conventional problem we have

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,600
love the stock and then a 32 square foot

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:42,989
table in terms of grid form can do about

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:45,719
2,000 clones a month and then that one

16
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:48,209
table roughly you know if we if we have

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,189
two thousand we take and refine it to

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,929
say sixteen we could put sixteen hundred

19
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:54,599
clones and every eight square foot of

20
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:58,710
space so it's eight so it's about 40

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,780
square foot for table and for subsequent

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,030
rack to hold it over the course of a

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,219
month because it takes about two weeks

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,989
just strike roots and then it takes

25
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:08,969
about two weeks for the plants to kind

26
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,579
of come back to carnival form so this is

27
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,129
rhythm that you work with once you dial

28
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:18,150
in the size of the plants and your

29
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:22,349
gridding and the 40% space which we've

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,750
taken off the top is holding racks it's

31
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:27,118
work space things that let you do

32
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,188
transition but if you're in if you're in

33
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,180
nursery business I think a lot of people

34
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:32,219
you know what they do is they produce

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,549
stock and then they send you out list to

36
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,868
go look for it and for me my my method

37
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,020
had always been to acquire clients

38
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:42,688
previous so I had a different approach

39
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,340
to move in plants then a lot of people

40
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:46,828
did so what it did is as soon as I had

41
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,140
the plant ready it we called you and you

42
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:50,699
came and picked it up and so what it did

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,640
is it allowed me to have a much more

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,469
efficient rotation in my racks so that I

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,069
didn't have to have so much redundant

46
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:01,048
holding space right so the main thing is

47
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:02,849
if you got 10,000 square foot it means

48
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,969
you've got 6,000 square for the work

49
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:08,399
space and if you take that 6,000 square

50
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:11,609
foot and you divide about 40 that'll

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,860
give you 2,000 clones plus 1600 on a

52
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,100
rack per month with my

53
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,290
stocke kind of what's from your

54
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,669
perspective a healthy mom like how many

55
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:25,590
clippings you can take per week and then

56
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:30,089
what were some strategies that you've

57
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,129
used to kind of increase the weekly

58
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:37,439
yield or whatever your measurement of

59
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:40,740
number of clippings per time period well

60
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,150
the first part is that with when it

61
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,879
comes to healthy mom it's really about

62
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,830
hormone hormonal dominance in terms of

63
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,710
juvenility what the plan is expressing

64
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,930
itself as a juvenile plant and it's

65
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,270
tissue is extremely herbaceous and it's

66
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,620
cellular growth is really fast because

67
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,820
that's what we want to capture in a

68
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,740
clone and so the bigger older plants use

69
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,870
that on the interior and you only end

70
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,270
getting it on the tips so you end up

71
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,310
having a lot of space devoted to

72
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,400
something that gives you relatively few

73
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,310
clones so I would rather have rotations

74
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,980
of plants constantly weaving through the

75
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,650
mother op so if you if you were to take

76
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:22,649
plants and put them in three gal and say

77
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:25,379
we get you know 50 plants per table that

78
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,890
that that table would take me probably

79
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:32,909
40 days from planting to cuttable form

80
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:36,149
once I cut it though I'm on 2,000 plants

81
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:38,879
a month off that table and I'd like to

82
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,280
run it for at least two months so I'd

83
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,139
get four cuts off of it I don't cut it

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,789
every week and cut it on a cycle and so

85
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,199
the once we once we build them and the

86
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:47,939
building part is a part that people

87
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,500
don't catch is that you're gonna come in

88
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,569
and you got to shape them and soft tip

89
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,430
them so you can start to defuse the

90
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,289
hormones and create the skeleton and

91
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,090
then you have to come in and clean out

92
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,799
the skeleton so did you get the real

93
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,349
shape that you want so that it's really

94
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,320
symmetrical and then that plant now

95
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:07,560
allows you to have a beautiful display

96
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,389
of clonal material on a grid that gives

97
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,599
you an incredible amount of clones per

98
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:14,309
square foot so and I and I like these

99
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,199
methods because for most people that are

100
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,329
working in their own world having a very

101
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,310
efficient small nursery for themselves

102
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,560
or for their operations is ideal where

103
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,970
every new space is great and don't get

104
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,310
me wrong more square footage is never

105
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,060
bad it's just that for most people they

106
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,040
don't have on

107
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,199
square footage and so you can realize

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:37,040
you don't need a lot of space to be able

109
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:40,168
to generate a lot of plants and the the

110
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,939
was the question we don't get so happy

111
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:43,139
about talking about kalam plants where

112
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:50,310
was the what was the first question we

113
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:52,918
were talking on that one rotation I was

114
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:56,310
talking about help so the rotation is if

115
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:58,469
I could get four cuts for good cuttings

116
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,259
off the plants that means that that

117
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:06,110
single plant that single tree Guilin

118
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:10,519
plant gave me a hundred and sixty clones

119
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:15,240
over a two-month period so that single

120
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:17,339
square foot was worth $1,600 so eight

121
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,800
hundred bucks a month per square foot in

122
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:22,709
mother production but that's really

123
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,199
effective money you don't know I mean so

124
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:28,079
like for me you if you can get four cuts

125
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,519
off that mom and then slide another mom

126
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,918
in that you've already started to build

127
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,478
so once you build a table you can have

128
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,728
another table that you're building with

129
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,978
smaller plants it takes 45 days to build

130
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:40,469
a plant but part of it is in that early

131
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:41,939
stage where they're in threes and then

132
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,890
they're saying ones and you're getting

133
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:46,889
this the frame and the structure shaped

134
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:50,879
then you can shift it in so four by four

135
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:54,300
of one is going to be able to transform

136
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,189
into a full four by eight threes so you

137
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,520
don't need as much space to build the

138
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:02,668
chain but the actual square footage per

139
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,680
yielding amount of mother's stock comes

140
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:07,228
down to those plants and so say we go to

141
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,728
five gallons of cocoa right then all

142
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:11,009
we're doing is we're still going into

143
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:13,199
that same amount per square foot we're

144
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,750
just getting it off of a larger plant

145
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,788
and I like plants that are in the three

146
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,370
gallon range if we're going to do push

147
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:22,379
and if it's organically built where

148
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,819
you're you're doing full organic bottom

149
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,430
and I almost have to go into like a

150
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,529
seven otherwise I'm having to run too

151
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,000
many T's through it continuously I don't

152
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:32,459
have enough in the sink to do top

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,379
dressing but the problem with seven

154
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,149
gallon pots is that you know you take

155
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:38,279
the pot right out of the table and you

156
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:40,750
put it on a spindle so I had these

157
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:43,179
chairs you sat down and that had

158
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,680
spinner and the plant would sit on the

159
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,900
spinner and you could turn it with your

160
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,490
feet and that way you could sit down and

161
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:50,769
take all the cuts off the plant and

162
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,300
clean it up and then put it back because

163
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:54,789
if the workers having to bend over this

164
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,740
shit they're miserable and so if you're

165
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,569
having you know good production from

166
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,490
your cloners you want to make it so that

167
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:03,129
it's easy on them to do the harvesting

168
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,160
and so plants that are too big

169
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:09,069
become difficult to physically move and

170
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,740
and spin around and then plants that are

171
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:15,159
too small require too much of a frequent

172
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:18,910
irrigation and so it's it's easier if

173
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,860
you're setting stuff up to where in in

174
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,770
in our world in humble County we've had

175
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,389
so many power problems and so many water

176
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:27,490
problems like we live in the country

177
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:29,860
even though it's it's got full

178
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,079
infrastructure the weather and some of

179
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,840
the issues here shut down in your world

180
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,750
and so I try to create a system where I

181
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,189
always have a little bit of a buffer on

182
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,899
immediacy of watering it's the same

183
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,668
reason why I came up with putting up

184
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:44,978
perlite in the bottom of the tray under

185
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:46,810
the Oasis tray that's not for irrigation

186
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:48,819
it's the opposite you actually it's

187
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,009
really not the best way to use an oasis

188
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,810
media or rock wall is to put it on a

189
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:55,629
secondary drain matrix because it

190
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,990
changes the water height column in the

191
00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:01,449
cube itself it's so that when the plants

192
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,879
root they have a secondary matrix to go

193
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,889
into so that you can always lay a layer

194
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,829
of moisture in that right in that

195
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:11,709
perlite grid that doesn't completely

196
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:13,689
saturate the upper grid but allows you

197
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:15,399
to have a hold ability the plan if you

198
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:17,439
suddenly have in clients that don't show

199
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,079
up for a week or we have temperature

200
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,490
that goes up to 110 and they decide they

201
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,639
want to shut the power lines down

202
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:28,930
because we're having fires in a region

203
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,569
around us which happens here so I don't

204
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,538
like to have plants that are driven

205
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:36,879
heavy in smaller pots because ultimately

206
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:39,098
if I have any issues at all and I wilt

207
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,740
the moms then what I'm doing is I'm

208
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:45,670
destroying $800 a square foot of

209
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:48,220
production so like with my own stock and

210
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:51,069
mother operations once you efficiently

211
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,959
build a grid they're very valuable and

212
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,730
so you have to kind of create a system

213
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,219
that works to fit your tray

214
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,589
fit your Carter's to fit the amount

215
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,839
material you're moving through most

216
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:03,430
people when they do nursery prop they

217
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,019
always build way more than they need

218
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:07,149
because they don't have the business and

219
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,980
then they go try to sell this shit and

220
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,509
that's not the way you approach nursery

221
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,730
because nurseries not isn't something

222
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,919
you can put on the shelf and hold and I

223
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,899
see it constantly in the ads that I get

224
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,969
bombarded with where you're trying to

225
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,470
sell me a clone and then you're trying

226
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,790
to sell me a cheaper clone and the

227
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,740
picture it's like nine ten inches tall

228
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:24,909
now and then you're trying to sell me

229
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,589
something in soil because you

230
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:28,240
transplanted them then you're trying to

231
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,130
sell me a teen because you transplant it

232
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,560
again and then finally your nursery

233
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:33,730
doesn't exist anymore because you spent

234
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,958
too much money trying to build an

235
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,920
operation that you couldn't sell the

236
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:42,099
plans and so all that stuff has to fit

237
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:44,439
into your density and operational

238
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,389
characteristics of your mother's and so

239
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,250
I know some nurseries that run you know

240
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:51,190
current culture under current systems

241
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:53,980
and they get phenomenal root development

242
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,540
in those buckets and the plants that

243
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,509
come out the top a massive and they

244
00:09:55,539 --> 00:10:01,208
they're using tissue culture derived

245
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:02,620
plants to begin it and that system where

246
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,909
I don't know there's square-foot numbers

247
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,429
but I know the clones coming off

248
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:08,198
beautifully so you know there's no magic

249
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:11,229
way to do it it's just that each

250
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:13,750
situation has to work for you and the

251
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:16,839
greater the degree of complexity the

252
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:20,198
greater degree of infrastructure

253
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:25,000
security you have to put into play or if

254
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:29,559
it backfires it'll wipe you out good how

255
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,600
long is a mom and the rotation and

256
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:34,088
you're in your setup like before

257
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,949
essentially she gets retired oh I'd like

258
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,620
to see two months I'd like to see four

259
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:40,990
cuts come off I'd like to see it take 45

260
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:46,028
days to build her and then she lives for

261
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:49,240
another 60 as a form and then I can't

262
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:51,909
and then I can take her in composter so

263
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,610
we had a big compost so it's a short

264
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:56,559
short life cycle yeah yeah it has to be

265
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,659
because the problem that you get too is

266
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,659
that you know you've got so many issues

267
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:03,938
in in cannabis in terms of pathogens and

268
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:05,980
everyone's experiencing this now we're

269
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:07,389
like oh they go whoa haven't hold a

270
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,200
couple hundred thousand plants in your

271
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:11,110
hands it's it

272
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,210
a lot tougher than holding 20 and you

273
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,340
you get spots where you can't see

274
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:19,240
pathogens move in and then they just go

275
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:22,600
wild in the operation and so the bigger

276
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,820
older plants because their canopy is so

277
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,159
thick there that's where they hide and

278
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:30,820
so with smaller plants that you're

279
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:32,459
cutting two times a month you can take

280
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,530
the plant right out of the table and

281
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,820
then spray it good you can because

282
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,649
you're gonna lay all your beneficial

283
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,270
predation in but the bottom line is when

284
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:43,480
you're constantly cutting plants at a

285
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:46,029
nursery you're you're you're delivering

286
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,730
with the clone the beneficial predation

287
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,470
it leaves you don't shake it off when

288
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,420
you cut it you just cut and quagga them

289
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,830
well they're in the tray they're in the

290
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,719
build and then when the clone when that

291
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,180
when the plants leave while your

292
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,310
beneficial predation leaves with it so

293
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:03,929
you constantly happen to inoculate the

294
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:06,309
plants within the nursery itself and

295
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:08,589
using something even simple as like a

296
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:10,419
Bronner's peppermints so just to knock

297
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,950
stuff down and to make sure that any

298
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:14,409
soft body insect it's going to get

299
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,840
desiccated using some kind of a good

300
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:18,459
fogging spray system just makes it

301
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,280
really easy when the plants are whole

302
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:25,360
double and moveable and you know it just

303
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,309
makes it really really containable so

304
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,710
easy you know this is the longer the

305
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:33,069
plant lives with you the more more more

306
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,269
more at home it becomes and things start

307
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,830
to live in it and it's that's why you

308
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:38,590
want to flush him out and I've had moms

309
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,389
that I've kept like for years non-stop I

310
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,960
mean they had to stem on in the size of

311
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:45,730
a you know like a leader soda bottle and

312
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,139
I mean and it was the but it was it was

313
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,029
like my favorite plan ever because I

314
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:51,399
grown it for four years at this building

315
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:52,899
and I just kept bringing it back down in

316
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,090
shape and height so it almost looked

317
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:58,240
like a sprawling maple tree you know it

318
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,220
had kind of bonsai dup but bottom line

319
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,250
is per square foot it did not deliver

320
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:09,759
the same amount that you get off a flat

321
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:12,070
platform right so I I know you your

322
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,689
nursery just has a single client but

323
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,230
have you been following kind of the

324
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:20,080
nursery market answer the question so

325
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,909
the quite the question is nurseries that

326
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,570
you know obviously there's a

327
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:27,850
of nurseries in terms of quality and

328
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:30,730
reputable 'ti but for nurseries that you

329
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:33,250
respect out there kind of what price

330
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,639
trends have you been seen in terms of

331
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:39,970
you know if someone wants to buy 5,000

332
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,789
10,000 20,000 50,000 clones kind of what

333
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:47,019
price trends are you seeing and the per

334
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:49,059
clone cost you know that's funny I don't

335
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:51,460
know like I mean to be honest I hear the

336
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:54,809
range of prices but I don't know the

337
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:58,150
actual number is being cut because the I

338
00:13:54,809 --> 00:14:00,429
I know whose produces some good work but

339
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:03,220
because I don't purchase clones from

340
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:05,409
them and any time anybody sends me any

341
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,960
kind of like clone pricing lists through

342
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:10,809
on the internet because of my email tied

343
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,720
into through our licenses I just I cut

344
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:16,269
that shit out so I'm not buying anything

345
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,120
I I don't know I think that you're

346
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:20,679
probably looking and it depends but I

347
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,539
think that you know and it's something

348
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:26,139
that would be a teen would be about 20

349
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:27,759
bucks if you're talking seed stock up to

350
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:29,559
you know your knee like coming out of

351
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,669
plant Humboldt I think those plants are

352
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:35,199
closer to like you know 25 to 40 the I

353
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:37,209
think the goal of some of the new

354
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,850
nurseries on the tissue culture end is

355
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,129
to get them on the $5 range where you're

356
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:45,850
getting a $5 tissue culture plant that

357
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:47,679
is flawless you know and so I'm paying

358
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,480
attention to nurseries and operational

359
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:53,079
stuff but I'm not involved in the sale

360
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,029
so it's funny I mean I'm is deep in

361
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,800
prompt as I could be but not on the sale

362
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:58,959
end of it because of the way I work with

363
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,359
my contract so I'm kind of out of the

364
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,460
business and nurseries but not the tech

365
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm involved with other nurseries and

366
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,440
doing tech and assessment and then

367
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,180
helping establish the libraries of what

368
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,400
you're actually running and why you're

369
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:13,899
running it because a lot of times with

370
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,490
nurseries people get into it but they

371
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:17,019
just go buy plants from somebody but

372
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,610
they don't really understand why they're

373
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,340
buying I mean who's smoking it and what

374
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:23,080
you doing with it and so the issue is

375
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,850
that nurseries end up producing some

376
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,810
really premium products of things that

377
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:30,250
the market doesn't want to buy so if you

378
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:32,199
know I mean for real and and so it's

379
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,279
pretty rampant and so for me because

380
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,400
I've had so many years of experience

381
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,350
selling

382
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,169
products in cannabis and and

383
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:42,230
specifically putting plants that were

384
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:44,629
prior not heavily pushed into the system

385
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,759
and then pushing them a B because I knew

386
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:48,350
the market would take it that's where I

387
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,909
get to kind of work with nurseries now

388
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,950
is to say look this is so this is a

389
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:54,169
really good example of OG if the market

390
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,500
likes OG Kush you can trust that this

391
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:59,709
variety will satisfy that market from

392
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,940
now until they're done smoking OG

393
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,889
because there's no question that it's

394
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,570
premium and then what it does it lets

395
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:10,299
the nursery then be able to say okay

396
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:13,220
that covers our og old-school base and

397
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:14,870
you have to have a library setup of

398
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,310
things that are staples and then you

399
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,740
have to have a library set up with

400
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:20,569
things that are burgeoning and so we try

401
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,159
to figure out you know what is hot what

402
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,140
is the trend and is it worth really

403
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,240
catching it is it worth doing the work

404
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:29,389
to develop the beds the system the

405
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:33,049
marketing to get that into play or is it

406
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:34,939
just a fad and if it's just a fad then

407
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:36,439
what you do is you put a lot of work in

408
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,000
and you send a lot of people into that

409
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,280
road and all of a sudden you know the

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,149
system is only meant to take 20 tons in

411
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:46,519
this 50 tons you got a problem

412
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:49,819
what nursery is in California do you

413
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,759
think are doing good work you know I

414
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,070
think I think that I like I like

415
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,600
cultivated on a Sacramento I think

416
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,830
Sergio and his team is doing a nice job

417
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:03,440
and I think that conception nurseries in

418
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,450
Sacramento they just came online I think

419
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,920
they're about to they're going to turn

420
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,630
you upside down with what they're going

421
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,009
to put out on our market like you're

422
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,750
gonna see some shit coming out of there

423
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:13,910
that's going to be insane in terms of

424
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:17,329
how vigorous those plants are because

425
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:20,330
their process of propagation is it is

426
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:21,679
better you know and so Sergio's team is

427
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:23,029
doing good work though they they're

428
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,860
putting out beautiful products and you

429
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:27,379
can get those at dispensaries too which

430
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:30,529
is killer because the library that he

431
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,910
put together his premium and the quality

432
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:34,910
of the product he's releasing his

433
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,470
premium so I know they're doing good

434
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,870
work and then in Humble County you know

435
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,620
you got Hendrix on the north end of the

436
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:46,099
county they always have a curate a good

437
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:48,019
library I don't really deal with any of

438
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:49,759
the other nurseries nearby me

439
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:53,509
because I wearing different different

440
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:57,470
spheres and so I think if you look at

441
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:59,629
four seed plants giacomo lot of riceland

442
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,880
with the plant hump you know planning on

443
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,440
bolt he does all the seed plants so that

444
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,810
you're getting something from seed them

445
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,940
work out of different entities that he

446
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:11,389
chooses from and that's really popular

447
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,730
for people who want to run their six I'm

448
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,350
sure there's some nice nurseries down in

449
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,150
mando that have thrown some good work

450
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:20,000
out but I don't I don't go to see them

451
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:22,660
you know it's only it's only larger

452
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,460
operations that hit me up to talk about

453
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:29,300
you know how do you shape a library how

454
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,769
do you how do you understand market but

455
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:32,509
I know this and that there's always good

456
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:34,490
operators you know this yes just go take

457
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:36,890
a look and see you know who's got the

458
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,299
craft background because the craft

459
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,670
background is going to influence

460
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:43,909
completely what the selection of plants

461
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:45,740
available at the nursery are otherwise

462
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:48,170
you just collect and shit so I see

463
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,000
people with like 80 90 hundred things on

464
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,670
the label and I'm like would you get it

465
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,619
from and it's just random shit so you

466
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,180
know it may be that thing but it doesn't

467
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:58,789
mean it's the one that people got really

468
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,500
addicted to you know buying and so you

469
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:02,180
have to end it and no one's run this

470
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,769
shit so I see people all the time and

471
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,029
I'm like did you run the plants like no

472
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:08,059
we just got the cloner I'm like I don't

473
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:09,500
even know it's the clone so it has to be

474
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,659
people that have a cultivation

475
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,450
background where they understand that if

476
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:17,120
you released a plan into the system you

477
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:19,970
had some idea of what it did so that you

478
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,789
know how to assist the cultivator on

479
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,980
placing it correctly some cultivators

480
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:27,200
shouldn't grow certain varieties some

481
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,329
regions don't take certain varieties

482
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,000
very well in terms of acceptance in the

483
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:33,619
market and some varieties are just so

484
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,359
damn valuable that you want to make sure

485
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:37,579
you don't release too much of it into

486
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,099
the system as a nursery so that you can

487
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:42,559
maintain that upper shelf where you can

488
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:44,659
actually if you're smart you can kind of

489
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,889
control the movement of certain products

490
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,200
if you're the one that's putting them

491
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,390
out because you only put out so much of

492
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,809
it and what it does it allows you to

493
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:56,960
have these hotter items that bring

494
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,639
people into awareness of your farm so if

495
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,289
you're touching something that has great

496
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,880
awareness and people buy it and your

497
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:04,069
labels connected to it

498
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,610
look at you differently if you are able

499
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:09,200
to connect to them so I go that shit is

500
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:12,939
like that's what I dig about nursery's

501
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,049
is that you know propagating trances is

502
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,880
spiritual man because you get into this

503
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:19,369
rhythm when you propagate student seed

504
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,710
work and doing clonal work you get lost

505
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:24,049
in propagation and you just you're there

506
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:27,710
so it's just it's cleansing to me like

507
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:29,539
this it's so unbelievably focused that

508
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,840
you really do lose track of everything

509
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:36,079
else except what you're doing so that is

510
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:38,629
an art I love but the business and

511
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,689
nursery I think is misunderstood by most

512
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:44,330
because they they don't realize that

513
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,430
you're you're you're really the market

514
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:48,919
interpreter so where you're having to

515
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:51,769
look at the stores and the burgeoning

516
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,830
markets and declining markets and create

517
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:56,750
your libraries to fit that reality not

518
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:58,579
necessarily things that you'd like to

519
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,500
work with and most of the time the shit

520
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:02,470
that props great and grows well and is

521
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,269
extremely efficient per square foot is

522
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,500
not what you want to grow you know

523
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,900
you're a breed of Steve on there the

524
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,970
other day right and he was hysterical

525
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,030
but he's like you know the the good shit

526
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,690
never goes big and and the purple shit

527
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:18,740
that looks better

528
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:20,240
it's never the strong shit and no he was

529
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,829
so he was so accurate because that's

530
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,720
just one of those things every now and

531
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:26,599
then all things come together as this

532
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,430
holy grail in terms of plural work the

533
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,759
perk was the Holy Grail because the perk

534
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:34,100
gave you fantastic clone rates and it

535
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,450
branched really well so when you were

536
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:37,730
working with purple you knew that every

537
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,529
tray you touched they all plugged they

538
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,720
were all very even in height they didn't

539
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:44,149
have different hormonal concentrations

540
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,769
throughout the canopy like ogee does so

541
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,509
the trays always look really symmetrical

542
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:49,549
everything always looked beautiful

543
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:51,049
it did everything you wanted it to do as

544
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:53,299
a propagator and the market was

545
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:55,250
accepting it like a vacuum cleaner so

546
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:57,019
that's you know that your job in the

547
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,819
nursery end is to find the things that

548
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:00,650
work well for cultivators just because

549
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,089
you can plug it doesn't mean growers are

550
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,220
going to want to grow it it doesn't mean

551
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:06,799
buyers are going to want to buy it right

552
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,660
so if you're good at nursery where

553
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,029
you're and to me nurseries are somebody

554
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,430
who's introducing stock into the system

555
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:15,589
you don't just propagate material

556
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,840
because in cannabis there's no bank

557
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:20,240
to go to to get the source material

558
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,459
where most nurseries can do that they

559
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,829
get seeds from a common company they put

560
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,149
it out in in massive form they may do

561
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:28,759
their own in-house

562
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:30,798
speciality production once they get big

563
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:32,599
enough but most nurseries are just

564
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:35,148
really replicating work that they get

565
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:36,888
from catalogs in cannabis we don't have

566
00:22:35,148 --> 00:22:39,168
these catalogs we don't have these

567
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:43,248
proven cultivars we don't have the

568
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:44,809
consistency to do so and so that's where

569
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:46,579
I think you see a lot of these bigger

570
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:47,990
operations that light up nurseries

571
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:50,868
because when I talk to these guys and I

572
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:52,519
asked them what was the basis of your

573
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:53,808
build in the library that like well

574
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,849
these are the plants we acquired from

575
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:58,398
somebody and I'm just like so you're

576
00:22:55,849 --> 00:23:00,740
you're you're investing you know thirty

577
00:22:58,398 --> 00:23:02,748
million dollars in an operation and all

578
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,730
this downstream money that's going to

579
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:08,419
come from it all the things you have no

580
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,710
idea why anybody chose and so you know

581
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:11,509
that's the that's the thing without

582
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,759
nursery operators is that if you just

583
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:15,409
take a look to see who's the owners of

584
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,110
the nursery and how long have they been

585
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:20,929
doing nursery work they're gonna have a

586
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:23,028
better idea of what it is that that

587
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:24,798
should be sold in the place even if

588
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:29,240
their technology isn't as good I would

589
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:32,148
rather have a better plant produced

590
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,609
under less than optimal conditions then

591
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:39,018
the best fucking plant ever cloned that

592
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:41,089
couldn't sell you don't I mean like I

593
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:42,409
need the genetics because once you get

594
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:44,868
something that works for you on your

595
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:46,850
hill you can go find a lab to scrub it

596
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:48,648
you can go find a nursery do license

597
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:50,118
back work with you where they they'll

598
00:23:48,648 --> 00:23:51,979
say you'll say listen can you

599
00:23:50,118 --> 00:23:53,868
I need a grid of this can you produce it

600
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,548
for me what's the numbers and the money

601
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:57,678
so you don't even have to do in-house

602
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:59,388
because really if you were able to do

603
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,149
the math on it and both sides worked in

604
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:04,148
an agreement it would work for you
