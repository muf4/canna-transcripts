1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
one of the things we talked about

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:05,878
briefly the other day was going from

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,509
some of the smaller greenhouses you've

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,638
been consulting with to kind of you're

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:15,419
now doing a project down in Salinas

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:17,789
which is a much larger project so can

7
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:23,939
you talk about kind of some of the

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:26,760
nuanced differences of scaling out yeah

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,278
sure yeah it's an interesting project

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,900
for sure I mean I've been you know

11
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,579
involved in dealing with a lot of these

12
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,789
bigger greenhouses when I was doing

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,219
procurement and doing the designing and

14
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:41,128
equipment but now we came to a whole new

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,109
level where you know I'm involved in the

16
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,210
production side of things the actual

17
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,878
operations of the greenhouse and and

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,579
there's just a lot of moving parts I was

19
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,649
really surprised to see or I'm

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,270
fascinated by how many moving parts

21
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,160
there really are with these big

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,250
greenhouses and on the corporate side of

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,828
things whether it's a single best or a

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,308
big corporate group or whatever this

25
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,710
corporate really really slow there's

26
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:09,750
nothing that's fast about corporate

27
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:12,209
cannabis you know like on the smaller

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,118
scale we want something done we get it

29
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:19,530
done that you're the things that we talk

30
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:24,420
about in order to you know get stuff

31
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:27,659
done basically somebody that like I when

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,150
I purchased a greenhouse and it's no no

33
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,859
disrespect to the company but I actually

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,340
purchased the house because I was

35
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,319
purchased in Erik as part of the company

36
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,359
because what I wanted was I wanted the

37
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,728
troubleshooting support and I wanted

38
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,200
someone who was a conscientious about

39
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:46,340
trying to cut costs and keep

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,070
profitability high and not make

41
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,740
tremendous problems for the operator and

42
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:54,209
I think that that's the component that's

43
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,000
taken place when you make these

44
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:59,039
transitions from small to big is that

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,718
you're I always used to say the same

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,549
thing most people learn how to grow in a

47
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,379
closet and when they built a big

48
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,099
operation they just made that closet

49
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:10,829
module bigger and when you're talking

50
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,818
about these large operations the the

51
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,590
investor groups

52
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:17,169
to sink and say some of these ops you

53
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,640
know forty fifty million dollars so when

54
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:20,348
you when you've got forty million

55
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,199
dollars of someone else's money that

56
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:25,000
you're responsible for they they always

57
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,098
move slowly because they can't make

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,560
mistakes and come back for maybe damages

59
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:33,158
their reputations but it creates a

60
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,049
situation where they have to get people

61
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:36,938
that are competent at running operations

62
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:39,879
that are acre of level and above under

63
00:02:36,938 --> 00:02:41,438
undercover and that's extremely rare for

64
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:43,649
the old cannabis industry there was

65
00:02:41,438 --> 00:02:47,138
nobody running operations that big

66
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,700
period and so that's where these

67
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,650
problems are is that when I get brought

68
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:53,168
into jobs a lot of times it's just take

69
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,669
a look at the project and we realize

70
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:56,349
that the people that they brought in

71
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:58,150
were competent for you know five

72
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:59,768
thousand square feet but they're most

73
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,400
definitely not competent for three

74
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:06,280
hundred thousand square feet and that's

75
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,840
that's that's it that's a real problem

76
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,969
in the industry and that's why you're

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,519
seeing so many of these big ops fail it

78
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:15,188
isn't because anybody stupid it's that

79
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,400
the the the approach to it isn't

80
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:21,189
appropriate where the individuals who

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,280
are running the facility have to have a

82
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:26,739
cur level operational experience and

83
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,049
then the individuals that integrate how

84
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,000
you grow cannabis in terms of what the

85
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,889
market wants and how do we position it

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,318
price-wise and how do we position it in

87
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:37,689
its sale points there's this disconnect

88
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:40,958
between the three groups the commercial

89
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:42,519
operator who's used to run in tomato who

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,989
knows how to run a facility knows how to

91
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,239
run injections knows how to maintain

92
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:49,030
your your diff so that you're not having

93
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,979
environmental fluctuations the person

94
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,489
who knows herb and the cat that as the

95
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:56,379
money that process is not quick like it

96
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:59,169
used to be for us when we were in self

97
00:03:56,378 --> 00:04:01,328
you know more self control and so when I

98
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:02,709
go into these operations to I trip out

99
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:05,709
because you think it's going to be a

100
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:09,128
quick decision but it's a long laborious

101
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,840
dragged-out process and there's only so

102
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:12,310
many guys like you know we use arrogance

103
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,840
and example cuz I respect shut up

104
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,908
there's only so many of them in the

105
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,129
industry where they have commercial

106
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:22,269
level knowledge but they understand

107
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:24,939
cannabis as a product yeah Kevin's

108
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:26,199
exactly right and that that's exactly

109
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,699
what I'm seeing a lot

110
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,039
is that yeah there's people that know

111
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,050
the shit out of cannabis but moving it

112
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,480
big scale and keeping it efficient

113
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,090
yeah the cost of production really goes

114
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,120
up as people start to try to bring in

115
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:42,039
original nutrients or programs that they

116
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,519
had before because now you're working it

117
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,069
a lot bigger commercial AG level and you

118
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,289
need basically what's happening is is

119
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:52,120
there's only a fraction of big

120
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,939
greenhouse guys that want to get into

121
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,769
cannabis and a lot of them that have

122
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:58,329
gotten into cannabis aren't really

123
00:04:56,769 --> 00:05:00,639
interested in hanging out with the

124
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:03,250
cannabis people if that makes sense and

125
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,169
so we had a big disconnect where big AG

126
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,329
tried to come in that didn't know

127
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,520
cannabis lost their ass because they

128
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:11,259
didn't know the cannabis aspect and then

129
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,409
you have the cannabis people that didn't

130
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:16,629
have the big guys to help them along and

131
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,430
there's only a small fraction of big AG

132
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:21,189
guys that even want to be involved in

133
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,290
cannabis and make friends I guess with

134
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:25,899
the cannabis people so to speak and so

135
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,819
it's really a culture thing it's always

136
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:29,789
been a culture thing but now on this big

137
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:32,469
level there's also the culture of

138
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:35,350
cannabis people getting together with

139
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,860
the big AG people and everybody getting

140
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,410
along and having the same goals and you

141
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,330
know this this go-for-it approach we're

142
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,000
gonna win type a thing it really turns

143
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:48,129
into an ego battle of these guys know

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,160
this these guys know that nobody really

145
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:53,560
actually vibes together on these jobs

146
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,390
and so when you finally get the vibes

147
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,250
right and you have these big AG guys

148
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,629
that really love cannabis and really

149
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,569
love what they're doing and are really

150
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:02,860
interested in what you have to say a lot

151
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:06,699
of times whether you're right or wrong

152
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,199
they're open to the conversation you get

153
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,219
so many more things done and those are

154
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,709
the ones that are gonna make it

155
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,870
unfortunately like Kevin was saying

156
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:15,489
there's not a lot of those I can't

157
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,259
believe it I'm starting to really pay

158
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,019
attention to this more and I'm kind of

159
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:22,740
shocked at how many people are running

160
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:25,689
big stuff but aren't doing it from the

161
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,009
experience gag and running big

162
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:31,300
greenhouses it's it's it's it's kind of

163
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:32,920
surprising but at the same time if you

164
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,780
look at all the pot stocks and the way

165
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,910
Canada was going and these big you know

166
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:39,009
massive greenhouses how popular

167
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,580
extractions are and things like that a

168
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:43,279
lot of these people are getting

169
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:45,560
i but I mean the there bleeding out

170
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,089
pretty good and so you know we're

171
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,699
starting to see a lot of you know

172
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:51,589
especially up in Canada the bankruptcies

173
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:54,468
and different things moving to outdoor

174
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:55,668
you know it's like all of a sudden

175
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:58,310
everybody's gonna be a big outdoor

176
00:06:55,668 --> 00:07:00,889
grower it it's like fact that's what we

177
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:04,939
started with you know and it's kind of

178
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:06,560
coming full circle now so I mean it's

179
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:08,479
really important to get these things

180
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,728
dialed in and work with the right people

181
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,378
and knowing who the right people are

182
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:14,000
that's the other thing it's just like

183
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:16,099
the consumers they don't all know what

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,500
good quality is and a lot of the people

185
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:20,839
that are involved in this don't know who

186
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,759
the good people are either because

187
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,589
there's so many people on LinkedIn and

188
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,439
all over the place that come off like

189
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:30,439
professionals but it's really hard to

190
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,788
vet people these days I mean I've been

191
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:33,889
lucky enough to been around the

192
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:35,658
community and knowing Kevin and Scott

193
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:38,538
and all these different people so we

194
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:40,310
actually do pull from each other from

195
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:42,740
time to time you know a lot of us will

196
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,478
reach out to each other and say you know

197
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,939
I got this situation who's the best

198
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,310
person to talk to about this and it

199
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:51,740
could be irrigation it could be genetics

200
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,079
it could be you know pinpointing one or

201
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,300
two things but we try to source and deal

202
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,968
with the best of the best in those

203
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:03,168
particular categories in order to make a

204
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:06,379
lot of these big things work totally I

205
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:08,478
don't I don't do consulting as as a

206
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:11,930
business so to speak because I have my

207
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,878
own businesses what what I do those I

208
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,259
get brought in by people have asked and

209
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,509
say hey can you come in and take a look

210
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:20,060
at this and then I try to figure out

211
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:21,588
where I see the the evident problems and

212
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,348
then I try to get the people together to

213
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:28,038
see where this friction and then I can

214
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:30,378
try to figure out from my you know pool

215
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:32,509
of professionals that I know in the

216
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:34,550
industry who might be someone that we

217
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:38,538
could bring in who might be looking for

218
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:41,598
a new career opportunity and it's it's

219
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:43,098
to create a success and the thing is

220
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,930
that when you're building an industry

221
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,579
everyone at first was so hyper

222
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:48,109
competitive that each person was going

223
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:49,939
to be the top of the food chain and but

224
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,409
he went huge they were gonna take over

225
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,600
the industry you know that the shit

226
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,649
kicked out of them which just makes me

227
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,558
fucking over

228
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:59,649
because what it does is it allows there

229
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:02,118
to be a pace of development that lets

230
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:04,129
stratification for all operators to fit

231
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:06,709
in where these mega operations they need

232
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:09,100
to succeed they need to satisfy the low

233
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:12,518
cross markets they need to satisfy

234
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,319
globalism and then it creates the

235
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:18,409
awareness of what small scale is because

236
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:20,118
you have a comparison and a lot of it is

237
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:22,068
just trying to you know source through

238
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:24,259
the industry that we know from being in

239
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:26,748
the industry and just saying hey this is

240
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:28,579
the right person for the job I know my

241
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:31,428
limitations and I'm not afraid to admit

242
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:34,128
them because that's not where I'm trying

243
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:36,169
to make my my win in the things that I'm

244
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:39,019
good at I try to be very good at them

245
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:41,088
and what I've seen so much is that

246
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:43,909
everyone lied through their fucking

247
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:46,990
teeth and no one told the truth about

248
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:50,659
their limitations and so these investors

249
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:53,659
are coming in to do business and they

250
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:55,519
get lied to by operators and you go into

251
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:58,789
these places and you're like who the

252
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,308
hell design this shit and you realize

253
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:05,028
that the direction was steered from the

254
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:07,458
initial wrong and what it does is it

255
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:09,499
makes all of us look stupid and that's

256
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,419
the problem is that it diminishes us as

257
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:13,519
cannabis operators because we all look

258
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:14,928
like we're charlatans so instead of

259
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,539
telling somebody that you know you're a

260
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:20,328
fucking virologist when really you know

261
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:22,129
how to use a pump sprayer it would it

262
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:24,678
would help because then you can actually

263
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:26,778
hire a virologist then you can guide the

264
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:29,328
investment and you can guide the project

265
00:10:26,778 --> 00:10:31,490
and in the success of it you develop

266
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:33,678
your reputation you develop your success

267
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,139
but that's not what happened

268
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:38,028
men like this is a train wreck and it'll

269
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:42,110
clear itself up but some of the stuff

270
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:44,778
I've seen it's just crazy and it's the

271
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,240
teething of a new industry you know

272
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:49,578
whatever we did prior is irrelevant to a

273
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,600
couple years ago it really is this point

274
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:55,128
forward and it requires all of us to be

275
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,019
a little bit more honest about what

276
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:58,610
we're good at what we're not good at and

277
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:01,428
don't be ashamed to reach out for

278
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,899
assistance and and don't be afraid to

279
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:05,600
say look I know what I'm talking about

280
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:08,559
and that's just what it is can each of

281
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,779
you just give a couple that's the worst

282
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,849
so just quickly earth can each of you

283
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:18,470
give a couple kind of like bad news

284
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:23,540
bears uh things witnesses that you've

285
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:27,529
seen fairly frequently oh yeah yeah

286
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:29,360
actually Kevin who's designing these

287
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,549
things and that's one of my you know

288
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,580
starting points for the war stories is

289
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:36,289
like who thought this who designed it

290
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,660
and who said okay to all these things

291
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:39,799
because nine times out of ten when you

292
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:41,120
get in there with the cultivator or

293
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,429
somebody that knows what's up

294
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,549
the greenhouse facility isn't designed

295
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:49,309
for work and smarter not harder

296
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:51,139
basically and what it is is a lot of the

297
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,269
greenhouse companies design um the

298
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:55,580
builders that build them sell them and

299
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:57,649
design them and what I found is is

300
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,210
sometimes these guys will sprinkle in a

301
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:01,159
little bit of everything that they've

302
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,200
done it one of these jobs to make this

303
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:05,569
one masterpiece it's got a little a

304
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,730
little bell and whistle of all these

305
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,379
different little tricks and at the end

306
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,269
of the day we didn't need all those

307
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,860
bells and whistles or little tricks or

308
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,419
maybe we needed the whole trick and not

309
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,730
part of the trick you know and then and

310
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:18,679
we get into these situations where the

311
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,000
workflow isn't right you go who the fuck

312
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,849
thought of this and then that's like

313
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,830
well we went with this you know company

314
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,269
that's been designing greenhouses for 40

315
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,520
years but they've never grown anything

316
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:31,730
one time and all their knowledge for

317
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:33,409
growing comes from the people that have

318
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,450
grown in them before you know the other

319
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:36,980
vegetable growers and things like that

320
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,860
it's not the cannabis growers and

321
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,690
specific regions and states that you

322
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,610
know have these certain climates that

323
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,070
everybody's only grown primarily in the

324
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,779
summertime you know it's just a whole

325
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,940
different deal and that's where I kind

326
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:53,000
of get up you know a lot of calls or

327
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,830
situations in is like the designing and

328
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,659
the the the spending of the money it's

329
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,430
like that's the easy part and then they

330
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:00,379
gotta have somebody actually go grow it

331
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:03,079
and none of these guys in these big

332
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:04,100
scalable facilities were designed by

333
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,379
who's running it

334
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,269
like I haven't ran into one yet that is

335
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:10,129
designed by the guy that's running it

336
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:13,389
that guys usually gone before the

337
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:16,730
fucking shovels even you know the the

338
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:19,069
start the job and and how many times is

339
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,139
a cultivator asked to operate something

340
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,740
or use nutrients that they weren't

341
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:24,470
involved in

342
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,919
any of those decisions like Scott here

343
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,570
by the way I just got in sorry but a lot

344
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,779
of times we get brought into a facility

345
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:35,540
and a bunch of board room members

346
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,220
decided facility layout nutrient

347
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:39,860
considerations whether they're doing

348
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,840
Coco buckets what-have-you and then they

349
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,830
throw a cultivator in there and say all

350
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:48,649
right here's what we got for you go yeah

351
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:52,490
that that's the worst that's that's

352
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:54,259
probably more scent of cultivator though

353
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,690
the cultivators are going to say listen

354
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:59,029
you're you're putting me over a barrel

355
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:02,750
and I'm going to look like I'm an idiot

356
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:04,549
if I do this and you have to be able to

357
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,159
have faith in yourself to say I need to

358
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:09,649
leave the job and the problem is is that

359
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:11,389
you see the potential so greatly at

360
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,370
least from my experiences with when I

361
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:15,620
talk to the operators that are running

362
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,919
these projects that were created by five

363
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,320
or six people before them like the chain

364
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:23,449
of failure isn't just one person made a

365
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,730
mistake and everyone else pays you're

366
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,100
talking multiple CEOs that got canned

367
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,800
because they couldn't the investors can

368
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,200
the management group everyone that the

369
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,269
management group brought into canned and

370
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,500
a lot of times they can the guys that

371
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:38,569
was smart because they were

372
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,409
argumentative because they disagreed

373
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:44,900
with the approach and so the people that

374
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:46,789
had intelligence got weeded out people

375
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:49,549
that were basically able to tell a good

376
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:52,579
story remains they design assistants

377
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:54,109
don't lock up and then the cultivator

378
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,210
that's supposed to be that or run it

379
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,129
gets screwed but that's in life when

380
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,710
you're in a situation that doesn't pay

381
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:02,689
off for you it's best if you leave and

382
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,720
find another operation or what happens

383
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,400
is you struggle you fail you mostly get

384
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,320
wiped out because you want to succeed

385
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,559
and then you're attached to that

386
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,720
operation and that's part of it too like

387
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,879
my thing with cultivators is you need in

388
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,240
fact the owners the operators the

389
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:22,070
designers as much as you do the you that

390
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,810
you it's it's both you actually look at

391
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,230
each other or otherwise there's no way

392
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:30,019
you can do these projects it's not it's

393
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:33,470
not so simple but it's it's the way that

394
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:35,569
it's been laid out and I think that for

395
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,129
cultivators that I get hit a constant

396
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,629
saying hey I'm in this position and I

397
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:40,009
think it sucks and he said what do you

398
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:42,259
think I should do and I tell them tome

399
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:43,490
fuck off go get another job because if

400
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:45,919
they're gonna if they're gonna break

401
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,960
your balls over every detail that they

402
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,789
want you to execute that doesn't make

403
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,480
any sense because it's the motion that

404
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:55,699
they said in play that's ego and you

405
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,820
can't can't win they're so cultivators

406
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:01,730
with egos that won't listen can't win

407
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,860
CEOs investment groups with egos can't

408
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,899
win so think that's the pockets getting

409
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,300
cleaned out right now to where

410
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,519
eventually as we go forward you'll have

411
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:12,679
cannabis operators that have success in

412
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,110
operation being involved with the design

413
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:17,329
just like a good builder is involved

414
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,220
with the architect the architect creates

415
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,500
a project with the Builder who builds it

416
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,230
is part of the integration so we can say

417
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,700
look I see problems and that's the thing

418
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,769
is I see people making changes

419
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:31,340
constantly I don't see anything built

420
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:33,470
and then ran as built it gets completely

421
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,000
modified over and over and over by the

422
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,820
time you come in you just like you don't

423
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,350
understand what anybody's through and

424
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,950
salespeople a good man they're going off

425
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,990
on you go to LinkedIn anything you post

426
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,879
god help you but anything you post every

427
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,039
reply is someone trying to sell you a

428
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,230
product to go along with that thing

429
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,469
you're doing so the thing is you getting

430
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,930
bombarded non-stop with stuff how do you

431
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,399
even know what anyone's used and how do

432
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:00,169
you know where this success we don't

433
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,759
have a database you don't have a black

434
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:08,480
list you know it's it's tough so by the

435
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:11,449
way just quickly Scott the the guy who

436
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:16,449
ran the Carpinteria facility into the

437
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:27,709
ground is now the CEO of said company I

438
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:29,150
just found that that's amazing how are

439
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,730
they still in business that's what's

440
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:35,330
remarkable that gives me hope but to go

441
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:38,539
back to business go ahead yeah

442
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:40,339
but to go back to a point that Kevin

443
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:42,440
made that I think was really spot-on is

444
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:45,289
you know a lot of times we come into a

445
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,820
facility under you know unfortunate

446
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:49,159
circumstances trying to make them better

447
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:52,279
and a really common

448
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,620
we see is there's an investment group

449
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,089
that built what they believe to be a

450
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:59,000
state-of-the-art facility that's

451
00:17:56,089 --> 00:18:01,039
actually maybe you know some range of a

452
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,779
pile of shit to moderately successful

453
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,700
and they don't want to admit that they

454
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:09,200
built a bad facility or they don't want

455
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,910
to admit that they made a wrong decision

456
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,730
or maybe they don't want to admit that

457
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,650
one of these sales people lied to them

458
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:19,190
so there's a lot of that ego factor that

459
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:21,290
really leads to prolonged failure and a

460
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,580
lot of times these facilities like Kevin

461
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:24,529
said they might you know they might have

462
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:27,109
a cultivator that ran a for lighter and

463
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:29,389
a lighter and they try and put a the

464
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:30,740
common patterns are you have investment

465
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,150
groups that maybe don't want to admit

466
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,980
that they made bad decisions along the

467
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,050
way that's leading to their failure or

468
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,559
they don't want to admit that they have

469
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:41,779
the wrong cultivator in position and

470
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,000
they just get really really married to

471
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:46,279
those things and just ride them off into

472
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,309
the ground and I would say you know

473
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:51,410
probably the top three reasons for

474
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:52,970
failure of a facility that we see our

475
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,370
investment group that doesn't want to

476
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,390
admit that they built the wrong building

477
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:57,919
investment group that doesn't want to

478
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,050
admit they've got the wrong cultivator

479
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,580
or a cultivator that doesn't want to

480
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:03,500
admit that he doesn't have the skills

481
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:07,250
and doesn't seek the help needed to be

482
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,650
successful just write a couple of

483
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:12,109
specificity questions between the three

484
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:14,330
of you what percentage of the

485
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:17,659
greenhouses you're going into our

486
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:20,029
retrofit versus new state-of-the-art and

487
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,800
then when you're talking about the new

488
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:23,629
buildings that they build the wrong way

489
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:27,049
what are some common things that they do

490
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,730
that like examples of things they did

491
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:31,669
wrong even though it's a brand new

492
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,809
building you know earlier on when I

493
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,810
wasn't how I was listening to what you

494
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:38,299
guys were saying and you know at the

495
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:40,849
infancy of the market to be fair there

496
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:43,099
was a you know there's 50% snakes and

497
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:44,959
50% we just don't know like Kevin was

498
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:48,349
saying earlier we haven't gone this big

499
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,140
before and so there's a lot of guessing

500
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:53,509
or hoping or you know somebody

501
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,150
convincing you this is the path and it

502
00:19:53,509 --> 00:20:04,549
turns out not to be appropriate at scale

503
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:06,769
and it doesn't work properly and yeah

504
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:10,069
well for me I end up in a lot of new

505
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:11,569
greenhouses but it's almost 50/50

506
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:14,629
sometimes because there's a lot of

507
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:16,339
retrofits that do go on but at the end

508
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,460
of the day a lot of the new stuff is

509
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:22,129
even basic hoops new PVC you know I mean

510
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,289
it's not always big massive fancy

511
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,210
greenhouses because people are scaling

512
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:29,359
up to ten thousand square feet or more

513
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:31,100
with PVC hoops and trying to do AG

514
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,319
exempt stuff and they're getting all new

515
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:36,079
plastics and new you know way of doing

516
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:38,899
things and so scaling up isn't always a

517
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:42,019
fancy you know state-of-the-art new

518
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,540
greenhouse these days it's it's a mixed

519
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:45,740
bag so to speak and so while there's a

520
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:47,930
lot of new there's still a lot of

521
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,480
retrofits going on and some of the

522
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:52,940
common mistakes are just things that for

523
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,589
workflow for contamination purposes you

524
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,900
know one of the things that we deal with

525
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:59,509
a lot and I don't want to speak for both

526
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,490
Kevin and Scott but I know we all deal

527
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:03,680
with it is the cross-contamination and

528
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,529
setting up a workflow so the people

529
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,360
aren't going backwards and it's really

530
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:09,980
easy to have a facility that causes

531
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:11,839
people to go from clone rooms the

532
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,720
flowering rooms are passed by the same

533
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,369
doors or the same areas sometimes and

534
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,500
they don't realize that some of that

535
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:20,869
stuff needs to be separated and some of

536
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,579
these massive facilities you know we try

537
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:24,049
to create people that only work in the

538
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:26,059
veg downes they don't go over to

539
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,579
flowering the propagation people stay in

540
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:30,349
the propagation when you you know tours

541
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,059
don't necessarily start out on the

542
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:33,980
flowering rooms and then end up in the

543
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:35,990
cloning rooms I mean which is most

544
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,529
common they're very common because I get

545
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,970
a lot I get toured around a lot and it's

546
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:42,200
you know people are starting to get the

547
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,569
hang of it a little bit but when it

548
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,700
comes to the design you know it makes

549
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,470
sense on paper if I was somebody that

550
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,299
just was looking at something cool on

551
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,380
paper I would say yeah that's beautiful

552
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:54,200
but if you don't take into the

553
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,360
considerations that we're thinking about

554
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,890
or the fallout that we've seen for some

555
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,139
of these reasons then you'd look at

556
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:05,180
these drawings and go this is crazy this

557
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:07,730
is like no way and so you know I don't

558
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:09,269
know what do you think Kevin I don't I

559
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,819
don't think I think

560
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:17,519
for me I see new facilities both small

561
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:19,589
AG exempt oops going in and they I think

562
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,859
they have less problems with those in

563
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:24,089
terms of integrating how you use it

564
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:24,599
because they they're more comfortable

565
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:27,029
with it

566
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,730
the newer facilities that I get to tour

567
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:31,379
they're you know state-of-the-art that

568
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,180
word gets thrown around but I mean these

569
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,460
things are impressive it's just that

570
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,130
they're way too sophisticated for an

571
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,559
average operator to understand and when

572
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:43,110
they laid it out they didn't lay out the

573
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,240
understanding that it's not normal

574
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:48,779
agriculture so you can't use chemical

575
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,750
spray models so if I chemically treat I

576
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:55,200
can I can control most all pathogen

577
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:57,359
problems but cannabis is so regulated

578
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,910
that it creates the situation where you

579
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,619
have to be hyper clean to the degree

580
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,330
that like when I show up in jobs and I'm

581
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,069
like you know you got to dress me and

582
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:07,769
they go no no we know who you are I'm

583
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:10,049
like I'm a fucking vector it doesn't

584
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:12,059
matter who I am like where's my

585
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:13,470
contamination shit the thing that I

586
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,929
noticed is that you know every

587
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,589
Investment Group has some attorneys on

588
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:21,269
the team so lawsuits aren't hard to file

589
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:24,179
when you're business partners a lawyer

590
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:27,180
and it really starts to create issues

591
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,769
where the the nurseries and even if it's

592
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,360
in-house nurseries it's your in-house

593
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:32,460
nursery you have to treat it like you're

594
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,379
going to get sued because you're going

595
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,000
to end up killing your own business but

596
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,910
for it you know while shooting er cereza

597
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,650
provide to the public the diligence they

598
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,990
have to put together to make sure

599
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:45,720
they're protected because there'll be no

600
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,640
forgiveness for the mistake because the

601
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,319
margins are so small that you can't make

602
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,240
it up and years past we could we could

603
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,159
make mistakes because we were all in the

604
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,140
learning curve and we all had a

605
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,350
different level of the ability to what

606
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,420
we could do because lack of legalization

607
00:23:57,349 --> 00:24:03,209
changed our ability to actually put

608
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:05,820
together stable infrastructure but now

609
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,009
that all that's in play man it puts you

610
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,629
in a hell of honorable situation and I

611
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:12,269
think that's where the rise of the labs

612
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,580
are coming in where the the technology

613
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:16,440
to get around these issues with orchid

614
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,699
to get around it with banana to get

615
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,950
around it with strawberry

616
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,420
they had to go that route because they

617
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,400
couldn't control it any other way

618
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,410
they're going to transfer in our direct

619
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,690
and I just think that that's important

620
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:30,810
for nursery operators to understand that

621
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,809
the technology that's coming out to deal

622
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:36,419
with these issues is expensive and it's

623
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:38,279
not simple to do and you have to make

624
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,080
sure you're clear that that's going to

625
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:41,639
be the future that's coming so if you

626
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,889
make the decision to be a nursery

627
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,250
operator and you develop partnerships

628
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:49,590
with these groups or you become your own

629
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,269
laboratory based system but I think a

630
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:53,669
lot of the conventional agricultural

631
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:55,650
practices we had and how we function

632
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:57,570
prior are gonna change dramatically just

633
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,580
like socially with the coronavirus I

634
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:03,359
mean this shit just changed the world

635
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:05,579
and a it's really hard to convince these

636
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,439
facilities to make the decisions that

637
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:10,169
will help them ultimately that's that's

638
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,140
one of our biggest obstacles is you know

639
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:15,029
a lot of times so many other bad things

640
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,770
have happened that now when it's time to

641
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:19,019
make a call that will really really help

642
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:21,710
you it's hard to pull the trigger

643
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:26,730
well they've run the runways gun runways

644
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:30,420
that they've to fuck around already is

645
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,519
is is excessive and so by the time we

646
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,380
get called in the shit's hit the fan

647
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:36,900
more than once and that's part of the

648
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,550
problem that we run into is that you

649
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,590
know we're not always called in at the

650
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:43,559
design phase we're not always called in

651
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:46,199
when things are you know about to kick

652
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,970
off there's a few of them and you know

653
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,400
here and there but they're few and far

654
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,650
between and so what ends up happening is

655
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,290
that the shit hits the fan so many times

656
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,210
the runway of money's gone if they don't

657
00:25:55,289 --> 00:26:00,779
make it this next six months or whatever

658
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:02,700
it's over with and so can they afford or

659
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:05,670
make the changes that are necessary at

660
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:09,240
this point and do they trust us because

661
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:12,480
they got PTSD right well the thing too

662
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,970
is it you know you don't you know you

663
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,710
don't want to spend any money if I have

664
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,680
to hear one more motherfucker tell me

665
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:26,640
they want to pick my mind I want to pick

666
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:29,610
your breath on to spend any money on the

667
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,940
initial but they will beg you to come in

668
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:35,490
and pull this shit out of a trench yeah

669
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,570
and I'm just like it's so much cheaper

670
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,259
did not make

671
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:44,279
the mistake but there's an arrogance and

672
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:45,960
I like I said I kind of like it I like

673
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:48,720
that the arrogance gets beat back

674
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,579
because it it let's there be a more

675
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,829
normality of the operators that are

676
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:54,569
coming in if everyone was so smart from

677
00:26:52,829 --> 00:27:00,480
the onset there would be no rooms with a

678
00:26:54,569 --> 00:27:03,210
small operator exactly that's how I see

679
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,130
myself still is a small operator and

680
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,230
that's where I want to be as a farmer I

681
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,330
never want to do large canopy for my own

682
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:13,440
production because it's not in line with

683
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:15,059
what I do but it doesn't change the fact

684
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,279
that I know that we have a need for the

685
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:19,319
larger operators it's just that there's

686
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,529
a humility period that's taking place

687
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:24,509
and you know and now you'll you'll be

688
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:26,339
able to come into these operations as

689
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:29,160
they move them and say hey look this is

690
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:30,929
a strategy let's work let's figure out

691
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,029
you know how do we move forward

692
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,490
correctly without putting ourselves into

693
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:37,319
a fucking graveyard and that's really

694
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:41,160
when I get brought in a lot is like you

695
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:42,779
guys are ready to die this I don't think

696
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,450
you're gonna recover the money and then

697
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:46,920
and and then the no one has any faith I

698
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,600
like I said I always look for the guy

699
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,370
that's got the huge bags under his eyes

700
00:27:48,599 --> 00:28:02,099
and fucking retreat in the airline

701
00:27:50,369 --> 00:28:04,349
because he's the guy with the money they

702
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:06,509
just want to be told the truth by

703
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,159
someone and everyone who's involved in

704
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:10,619
these big operations doesn't want to

705
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,410
lose their jobs nobody wants to miss out

706
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:15,209
on the big payday when it sells everyone

707
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,529
thinks it's gonna get sold for a fucking

708
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,809
billion dollars and everyone's gonna

709
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:21,329
dance in the money bucket you know and

710
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:25,710
it's it's a job you know you

711
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:30,289
it's farming and it's just so weird and

712
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:30,289
it's surreal to see it in person
