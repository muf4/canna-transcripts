like going home as a kid to some fantasy

156

00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,519
dollar reward

171
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,439
and um that was literally a thing right

172
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,680
right up into the 90s

173
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,560
um i know from personal experience

174
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,439
because like i know folks that got um

175
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,439
got

176
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,038
marked on like that and for five

177
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,639
thousand dollars like you know you would

178
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:14,079
have paid those guys

179
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,240
five times that to not turn you in

180
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,758
you know like please right you know but

181
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,280
that was a thing and people would fly

182
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,879
around and they'd look for grows and

183
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,000
then they'd they'd collect their their

184
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,680
reward

185
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,199
but that's like one of the negative

186
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
things there was a lot more positive

187
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,120
things on the ridge here especially the

188
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,279
san juan ridge because

189
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,519
um people there was a really tight

190
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,478
community and we took care of each other

191
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,120
there was always um you know people that

192
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,279
were in need that would um have a

193
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,199
donation jar at but the gas station and

194
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,879
that jar was always full like people

195
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,280
were always putting fives and tens and

196
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,199
twenties in it because like you know you

197
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,879
could feel for these people you probably

198
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,400
knew them and if you didn't know them

199
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,399
you know you knew they were good people

200
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,198
because they lived here so

201
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,879
um a lot of good stories about that like

202
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:04,160
here's a big one um in uh in the 70s uh

203
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,000
this school on oak tree road burned down

204
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,080
and um

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
so a bunch of growers and local folks

206
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,560
with some money um

207
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,120
built rebuilt the school just rebuilt it

208
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,280
right and but like in the state of

209
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,879
california you can't do that like that

210
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,079
when the school board got involved

211
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,399
they're like wait you can't just rebuild

212
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,399
the school but they had they had rebuilt

213
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,000
this school and but the union got

214
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,318
involved and all kinds of folks got

215
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,759
involved and and um so

216
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,319
another local just kind of got

217
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,240
disgruntled and burned it back down

218
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,240
and

219
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,918
and let the state rebuild it so that

220
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,478
school that cute little school over

221
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,719
there on oaktree's oaktree campus

222
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,360
that's the story there but it was it was

223
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,840
the growers money that helped um keep

224
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,560
this uh this

225
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,519
ridge and our whole community alive and

226
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,879
well economically and just like you know

227
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:59,598
helping out one another um

228
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,919
yeah i mean um i i don't i don't want to

229
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:06,478
ramble on but that's my story 41 years

230
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:08,478
in the trade and um and oh wait

231
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,038
a really important thing came along um

232
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:14,318
like we we always anticipated that at

233
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,240
some point samia would come along and

234
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,039
help us build this

235
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,519
community that we envisioned like this

236
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,519
strong thriving cannabis community

237
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,279
and my wife barbara

238
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,560
was going to start going to these

239
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,959
meetings down at um and at the haven

240
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,958
underground in nevada city and they were

241
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,278
started out as like what became the

242
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,879
nevada county cannabis alliance and

243
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:37,759
these were the people we were waiting

244
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,360
for

245
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,958
i like to tell this story because it was

246
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,080
so touching like we were like barbara

247
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,518
came home she's like hey you wouldn't

248
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,600
believe what we're talking about we're

249
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,440
talking about like starting an ordinance

250
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,000
here in nevada county that allows us to

251
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,000
grow you know like out and open

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,839
and we had been already like we had the

253
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,679
you know we had a script we were sort of

254
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,279
we were making the rounds of the at the

255
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,278
clubs in sacramento we were we thought

256
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:02,159
that was kind of quasi-legal and it felt

257
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:04,879
legal but it wasn't really legal but but

258
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,000
um so when when we started hearing what

259
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,360
these folks were talking about we

260
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
started getting involved and helped

261
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,879
create what became the nevada county

262
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,720
cannabis alliance and without the nevada

263
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,759
county cannabis alliance we never would

264
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,000
have gotten

265
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,759
through um the whole writing of the

266
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,720
ordinance and we wouldn't be sitting

267
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,639
here today having this event probably um

268
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,000
like that's the story of my farm we were

269
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,000
lucky enough to be

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
like one of the first farms we took the

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,919
the transition permit when we only could

272
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,519
have a thousand square feet

273
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,000
a thousand square feet like where we're

274
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,519
sitting here right you know and uh

275
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,919
smaller and um and 25 plants it's pretty

276
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,600
hard to make a living on 25 plants

277
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,360
and a thousand square feet yeah you know

278
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,560
so but we took it because like if we

279
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,959
didn't take it we were afraid they'd

280
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,359
take it away and then and then and then

281
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,679
we'd be back in a no ban or a total ban

282
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,919
community like it was for a little while

283
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,079
so but it was through a lot of strong

284
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,719
activism through the nevada county and

285
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,000
cannabis alliance and folks like wade

286
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,000
laughter here and gary and all of us

287
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,839
kind of step into the front and putting

288
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,600
our faces on the line because like you

289
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,959
know um for all those years we couldn't

290
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,879
be out front but now we felt like it was

291
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,559
important that people in the community

292
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,639
see that we were you know their

293
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,879
neighbors like i was also a contractor

294
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,120
so chances are i may have built your

295
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,120
house and then i coached soccer with the

296
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,200
kids and i might have coached your kids

297
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,320
soccer you know so like i'm i couldn't

298
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,600
be that bad you know oh yeah i also grow

299
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,040

you know oh you want to buy some

301
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,759
yeah so it turns out that you know that

302
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,600
probably a lot of people suspected that

303
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,000
all along but it feel it felt really

304
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,759

00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,319
i thought i'd start maybe at the

336
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,879
beginning like when would i did i first

337
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,360
plant a cannabis seed i remember now i

338
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,000
had to try hard i was 15 and a half

339
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,759
years old in 1970

340
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,759
in ventura county

341
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,439
and i think everything we grew was male

342
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,958
and we threw it in a bag and smoked it

343
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
and it got us more stone than anything

344
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,638
that we had had so far up to that point

345
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,679
at 15 years old

346
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,278
um

347
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,199
but when i went to college i moved to

348
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,519
humboldt county where i met my lovely

349
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,720
wife and felicia back here

350
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,560
um

351
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,160
and we grew a little bit of weed there

352
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,239
we lived close to town we had a

353
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,559
greenhouse with maybe you know i think a

354
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,959
huge crop for us back then was 15 pounds

355
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,958
of weed

356
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,959
and our daughter was born there and we

357
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,399
decided we were moving out of humboldt

358
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,879
county because we didn't want our kids

359
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,759
to grow up in a cannabis society

360
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,639
and we moved to nevada county

361
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,240
so

362
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,919
just think about the irony of that

363
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,440
sometimes

364
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,879
we were a little naive

365
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,120
and

366
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,278
so the first few years we lived here we

367
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,600
weren't doing anything with cannabis but

368
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,679
as you know things would happen we

369
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,800
needed some personal stash and planted

370
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,599
our own from seeds we brought with us um

371
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,120
but that so that's just a background of

372
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,480
where we came from

373
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,639
um

374
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,959
now our 32 year old son works in the

375
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,480
industry as our partner on the farm it's

376
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,719
all great i don't know what we were

377
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,480
thinking

378
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,360
but

379
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,800
so we have now a 25 100 square foot

380
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,759
license in the county

381
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,679
and

382
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,679
i have to double what brian said about

383
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,919
just all the hard work of

384
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,239
many people here and i mean wade and

385
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,159
diana and we were all working for

386
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,680
several years to get to the point where

387
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,039
we're at now just

388
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,479
just to where we could take a deep

389
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,240
breath and not worry about the sheriff

390
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,560
coming down our road every day i mean

391
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,039
that was my own setup was

392
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,518
to get rid of that anxiety and we have

393
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,919
different anxieties now but but it's

394
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,039
definitely a lot better than it was

395
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,360
um

396
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,360
let's see what was the other other

397
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,440
anecdote i thought about too back in

398
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,159
humboldt when we were growing there

399
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,240
there was no indica there was no girl

400
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,480
scout cookies there was just bagweed i

401
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,639
mean we planted uh wahawkin and

402
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,199
guerreron seeds that you know we had

403
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,120
leftover for years

404
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,439
a friend of mine knew someone who

405
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,000
imported afghani hash

406
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,079
into humboldt county on fishing boats

407
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,159
and he used to pluck seeds out of this

408
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,000
hash for years so a friend asked me he

409
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,919
won't try these afghani seasons like

410
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,799
what is that you know i had no idea what

411
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,599
it was

412
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,359
um

413
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,399
and the rest is history i mean several

414
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,320
years later that all came to humboldt

415
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,240
county and we are where we are now

416
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,079
because of those people who went around

417
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,000
the world and found those strains and

418
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,000
brought those seeds back so

419
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
i have to thank them

420
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
but again back to the

421
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,078
cannabis alliance and the

422
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,159
the whole thing with the county

423
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,159
so many people worked so hard and stuck

424
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,679
their faces like out on the line and i

425
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,360
mean i think we were both in the front

426
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,120
page of the paper a couple of times

427
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,159
right talking to the board

428
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,959
all of us

429
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:55,039
and um i i have to give credit to to

430
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,039
those people there's just a i couldn't

431
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,000
even name while there's like a lot of

432
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,958
people that worked hard so

433
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,720
[Music]

434
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,159
i'm glad we are where we are today and

435
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,199
this is wonderful to see you folks i'm

436
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,198
going to pass it off to wade

437
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,760
thank you gary

438
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,159
um

439
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,720
well

440
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,480
i'm kind of a rookie in this

441
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,399
lineup

442
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,440
i started growing in 1996

443
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,360
and

444
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,480
i lived in san francisco at that point

445
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,000
in my life

446
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,680
um

447
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,198
started growing for my own needs for

448
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,039
global glaucoma

449
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,000
uh pretty quickly realized the scale i

450
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,439
was doing it was not worth doing

451
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
and

452
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,279
after a series of steps ended up in a

453
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,959
small warehouse

454
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,399
in the south of market area of san

455
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,879
francisco and

456
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,480
uh worked there for five years

457
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,000
um

458
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,240
and then in 2010

459
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,958
monica and i started my monica's my wife

460
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,039
here and partner and hero

461
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,198
of all sorts of wonderful

462
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,879
um we started talking about we wanted to

463
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,639
get out of san francisco

464
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,320
and because we had a lot of friends up

465
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,639
in the mendocino humboldt area we went

466
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,959
up there and looked around and

467
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,720
not unlike gary's sense of it it was it

468
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,758
seemed like it was a one

469
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,240
trick

470
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,440
pony kind of town if you will

471
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,198
that the only thing that was really

472
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,959
happening there a lot of beautiful

473
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,919
people but cannabis was all that was

474
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,159
going on

475
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,278
but meantime here in nevada county

476
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,360
uh

477
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,799
i think the first time she brought me up

478
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,879
here was to the

479
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,120
wild and scenic film festival

480
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,799
and i was really struck by the kind of

481
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,198
people that i saw

482
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,198
and

483
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,759
i i was struck by the idea that there

484
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,839
were three different live theater groups

485
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,240
with their own performance space

486
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,399
in a town of 5 000 people

487
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,799
and very few towns in california

488
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,519
5 000 people have one theater group but

489
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,879
nevada city has three

490
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,039
so you told me there was something

491
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,278
really special going on here and

492
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,838
we came here we bought we rented a place

493
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,519
into the spring of 2011 found our

494
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,318
beautiful little farm

495
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:12,078
in the fall there and uh took possession

496
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,918
in september of 2011. so like i said i'm

497
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,879
fairly new to the county

498
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,559
but i

499
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,959
have really come to love

500
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,000
this place and the people that are here

501
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,600
and

502
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,959
yes i want to call out the cannabis

503
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,879
alliance and the work that the cannabis

504
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,558
alliance has done but even more

505
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,800
specifically i want to call out each of

506
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,759
you

507
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,678
[Music]

508
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,000
a thing that has really bugged me a lot

509
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,840
lately i'm sort of straying off of off

510
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,359
topic here

511
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,279
is the idea that

512
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,599
the court decision known as roe versus

513
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,119
wade might be getting overturned by our

514
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,959
supreme court

515
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,959
and it seems impossible to me but it

516
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,240
sounds like that's what's happening

517
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,440
and

518
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,839
i'm sure there's a lot of people who

519
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,919
feel like making signs and marching down

520
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,959
the street or maybe even burning down

521
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,000
buildings

522
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,558
but i would

523
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,400
really encourage every one of you

524
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,240
to register to vote

525
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,038
if you are not already registered to

526
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,720
vote

527
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:08,079
and vote

528
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,720
as soon as the elections happen vote if

529
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,159
everybody in this country votes

530
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,880
we can overturn

531
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,600
and make law that protects the privacy

532
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,000
of a woman and her right to choose how

533
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,519
her life is going to unfold

534
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,759
i really think this is an important

535
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,400
thing not just for women for all of us

536
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,480
but especially for women it's ridiculous

537
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,000
that we've come to this and the only

538
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,558
real power

539
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,640
that we as cannabis people or as human

540
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,798
beings in this country the only real

541
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,240
power any of us have

542
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,400
is the vote

543
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,519
and if enough of us vote we can make a

544
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,720
difference

545
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,599
and i'm not going to tell you how to

546
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,798
vote just get out and vote

547
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,038
and

548
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,038
i'm going to stop there that's politics

549
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,200
and i'll sorry for straying off but i

550
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,200
really think this is important

551
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,120
and if you and part of how

552
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,240
nevada county came to have the ordinance

553
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,639
it does

554
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,160
is if you remember back in 2016 at

555
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,400
january of 2016 the board of supervisors

556
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,720
created a they passed an urgency

557
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,798
emergency ordinance didn't know there

558
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,400
was such a thing but

559
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:16,639
after the vote it became law right then

560
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,919
no period for public review no nothing

561
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,038
and it basically prohibited all cannabis

562
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,360
businesses in nevada county

563
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,640
and we made enough of a noise that they

564
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,159
said okay well we'll put it on the

565
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,000
ballot

566
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,240
and we were fortunate that election that

567
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,400
was when bernie sanders and hillary

568
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,400
clinton were running against each other

569
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,559
so a lot of people voted for that reason

570
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,160
a lot of people voted because

571
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,798
the people who became the nevada county

572
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,080
cannabis alliance registered almost 4

573
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,519
000 new voters in nevada county that

574
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,960
year

575
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,000
and a lot of those people turned out and

576
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,720
voted

577
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,160
and we changed this county

578
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,240
with the one power that we actually have

579
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,360
and so

580
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,359
again i

581
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,678
i'm going to stop there i just say this

582
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:06,719
i love the plant i love what we've done

583
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,480
so far in nevada county and we're trying

584
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,919
to change the ordinance to allow more

585
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,919
license types

586
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,840
more events like this

587
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,360
and again the one power we all have

588
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,879
is the vote

589
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,558
and even if you don't think the system

590
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,320
works even if you think the democrats

591
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,399
are messed up even more than the

592
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,960
republicans or the republicans whatever

593
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,640
you know i don't care about your trip

594
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,798
just vote

595
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,880
because i think if enough of us do that

596
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,400
we'll get the kind of government we want

597
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,710
instead of the circus

598
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,240
we've had lately

599
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,600
[Music]

600
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,839
wow

601
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,839
okay

602
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:47,359
[Applause]

603
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,479
i'll close by this i care a lot about

604
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,359
cbd

605
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,798
uh harlequin house of harlequin is the

606
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,678
business that monica and i have created

607
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,599
with our partner uh it's an education

608
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,840
platform we want to help people

609
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,678
understand about the benefits that

610
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,720
cannabis can offer

611
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,759
not just for health but also for economy

612
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,400
and for

613
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,919
the well-being of a community like what

614
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,159
we have going on right here in nevada

615
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,280
county and increasingly across northern

616
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,960
california

617
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,279
um

618
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,200
and

619
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,440
it is my sense that

620
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,679
uh and i'm sure i'm slanted this way

621
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,200
because of harlequin harlequin's a plant

622
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,120
i discovered back in 2008 2009

623
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,960
turned out to be a real special plant

624
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,000
got it out to as many people to as many

625
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,038
places as possible for a number of years

626
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,640
since then i've really been focused on

627
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,240
versions of cannabis

628
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,880
that are helpful

629
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,120
for conditions like epilepsy childhood

630
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,159
epilepsy

631
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,279
and i want to say if any of you know

632
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,000
silas

633
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,839
a little boy who has seized for years

634
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,119
silas has been free of seizures since

635
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,038
september

636
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,000
which is a really big deal because he

637
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:02,960
used to have hundreds of seizures a day

638
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,240
and now he has been free of seizures for

639
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,240
going on

640
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,400
eight months nine months

641
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,079
yeah he's going to school

642
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,120
it's a really beautiful transformation

643
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,678
the whole family is doing well

644
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,439
and i know for a fact that cannabis kept

645
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,840
that little boy alive

646
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,240
to get to the point that he is now

647
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,519
i don't know that cannabis is involved

648
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,440
in

649
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,400
him not seizing anymore because i know

650
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,200
people who

651
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,559
grew out of having seizures as children

652
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,798
when they entered puberty and became

653
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,200
adults they no longer were seizing that

654
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,960
might be what's happening for silas

655
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,919
but when he was seven and eight years

656
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,600
old

657
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,640
his parents were told

658
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,719
he wouldn't live to be the age of 10

659
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,720
so they should get ready for that

660
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,839
and he is now

661
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,919
13 or 14 years old going to high school

662
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,199
having a normal life the families having

663
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,120
a normal life

664
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,279
this is huge

665
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,319
and that's a small part of what cannabis

666
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,599
can do

667
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,599
in the lives of

668
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,600
all of us actually i really think that

669
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,400
cannabis is an essential

670
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:12,719
nutrient that used to be in our diet

671
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,280
because our farm animals ate it and it

672
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,159
was on our farms and it was in our food

673
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,319
chain

674
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,240
but not for the last few generations and

675
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,240
i think that what we're doing here in

676
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,200
nevada county is getting that going

677
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,519
again

678
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,679
we're making we're normalizing cannabis

679
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:30,319
and helping people understand that it's

680
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,320
not a dangerous bad thing

681
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,158
it actually is good

682
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,000
and helps us feel good

683
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,320
so

684
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,558
i don't know i think i'm done

685
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:44,079

definitely some foundation

694
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,839
to a lot of the genetics that are out on

695
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,720
the streets today

696
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,639

so i'll let allen introduce himself a

709
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,400
little bit and

710
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,240
the other guys we've all talked a little

711
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,120
bit about what brought us to nevada

712
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,120
county and what makes us love growing in

713
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,959
nevada county in general so we can touch

714
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,558
on that

715
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,798
alan

716
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:48,319
originally from the bay area

717
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:50,798
got my start a little closer okay so got

718
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,879
my start in cannabis

719
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,558
because i like smoking this was maybe uh

720
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,600
just out of high school

721
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:57,440
um

722
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,000
this was before any kind of outdoor

723
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,400
growing that we knew about

724
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,159
this was before indoor growing so one of

725
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,798
my friends had this crazy idea let's

726
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,640
scale the poles at the bart parking lot

727
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,960
and we'll steal the lights off the

728
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,000
parking lot poles and try and grow

729
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,640
cannabis

730
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,400
and damn it worked you know so

731
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,640
and shortly after that a couple years

732
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,519
later berkeley indoor garden started up

733
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,320
and then we started having access to

734
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,400
actual grow lights and and uh

735
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,519
general hydroponics or you know that was

736
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,240
about it at the time um

737
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,000
i came a little closer sorry

738
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,200
if anybody can't hear just raise a hand

739
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,679
and i'll speak a little louder or

740
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,919
something i been i'm like 50 dabs deep

741
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,679
so you have to excuse me so

742
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,600
everybody i go walk by they're like bro

743
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,640
you gotta have a dab come over here so

744
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,759
which

745
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,919
love it but so anyways yeah um i came up

746
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,679
to this region originally because i had

747
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,880
a four-wheel drive company

748
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,038
and uh

749
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,120
the trails are up here so anyways that

750
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,359
went from that to restaurant industry

751
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,038
had a barbecue restaurant in town here

752
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,719
and

753
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,519
none of it was fulfilling and it just it

754
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,159
wasn't what my passion my calling was

755
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:11,599
i'm actually third generation of growers

756
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,720
out of humble and um shelter cove area

757
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,119
and uh

758
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,880
so once i was up here i've like fell

759
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,558
into a good group of local people up

760
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,480
here on the ridge that all grew outdoor

761
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,079
and i was like wow like i've only done

762
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,558
indoor and i didn't know you can grow

763
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,158
these giant plants this was a long time

764
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:27,759
ago so uh

765
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,320
but i

766
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,759
became a grower in the passion of loving

767
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:36,240
the plant and i i

768
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,240
my early history of breeding was that i

769
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,440
my stepfather was a grower and humble i

770
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,919
asked for some seeds he gave me seeds

771
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,840
and then uh the next year i didn't save

772
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,200
seeds i didn't make seeds so i went back

773
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,720
and i said dean i need some more seeds

774
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,720
and he slaps me upside the head and he's

775
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,038
all bro don't you know that you just

776
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,640
have to just make seeds and you can keep

777
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,200
growing every year every year this is

778
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,799
before we knew what cloning was so

779
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,759
next year he showed me how to make seeds

780
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:05,519
and that was in 1983 so i've made seeds

781
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:08,879
for myself and friends since 1983.

782
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,639
pretty much exclusive and uh

783
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,000
you know this has opened a lot of doors

784
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,000
cannabis is

785
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,200
a lot of great people a lot of

786
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,640
shady people in it too but um

787
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,720
i'm really

788
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,919
blessed that i was able to turn this

789
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,159
into

790
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,080
a way of life and

791
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,278
recently becoming the director of

792
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,359
genetics at a really big company

793
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,679
i never saw myself as a cannabis grower

794
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,839
being able to have 401k but as of this

795
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,440
week i have a 401k which

796
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:38,558
i i don't even know what it means but

797
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,480
you know

798
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,720
i have one now so

799
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,640
yeah it's definitely good but so the the

800
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,558
point being is that you know this is a

801
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,038
maturing industry and

802
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,359
and we go through the growing pains

803
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,919
obviously through this you know people

804
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,319
um we had it good for a long time and

805
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,880
with legalization it's made it pretty

806
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,119
difficult but i believe there's still a

807
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,200
lot of opportunity and if you do a good

808
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,439
job and you focus inward on yourself and

809
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,240
do the best that you can do

810
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,600
for the plant and the plant gives back

811
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,519
so

812
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,119
that's a little bit about my history so

813
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,158
i don't know

814
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:18,239
thank you thank you

815
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,399
thanks alan that was awesome little

816
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,319
intro

817
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,158
definitely you know she goes to show you

818
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,599
put your mind to it and you concentrate

819
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,080
on something

820
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,519
you stick with it and

821
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,558
you get somewhere

822
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,398
um

823
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:35,200
let's let's take it to be a little bit

824
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:37,038
more specific about growing and genetics

825
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,120
and and and

826
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,759
you know details like we talked about

827
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,359
how great our community is and

828
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,519
not to take away from that that's that's

829
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,599
also a really important part of why

830
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,200
we're all here but let's talk a little

831
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,918
bit about the weather and the growing

832
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,519
season and and what it's like in in some

833
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,759
other reasons regions because it sounds

834
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,278
like everybody all of us have grown in

835
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,519
different areas so

836
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:02,319
i mean i've i've grown on the central

837
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,918
coast i've grown in mendocino county

838
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,240
and you know for me

839
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,480
nevada county is like it's a breath of

840
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,200
fresh air it's like perfect amount of

841
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,880
moisture perfect amount of dryness

842
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,480
you know yeah the season could be a

843
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,480
little bit longer that would be great

844
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,640
but on the other hand compared to all

845
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,038
the other regions in the state

846
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,880
it's pretty cherry so

847
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,319
you know one of the things i really love

848
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
is the fact that we get these long

849
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,319
beautiful falls

850
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,519
so i'll just pass it down the line and

851
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,200
everybody just

852
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,960
say a couple things of why they love to

853
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,240
grow here and

854
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,038
and compare it to maybe some of the

855
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,558
other places you grow you grew and why

856
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,480
it seems like everyone's grown here

857
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:42,480
right now so

858
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,720
what brought you back and and keeps you

859
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,720
here

860
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,159
one of the best things about growing

861
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,359
here is the yuba river so if and no one

862
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,399
here has been to the yuba river you got

863
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,639
to check it out it's one of the most

864
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:57,759
beautiful places on earth other than

865
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,080
that the climate here is it's it's like

866
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,158
growing grapes in napa you know we have

867
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:05,038
a

868
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,320
special microclimate here that just

869
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,200
produces

870
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,879
incredible cannabis um the weather and

871
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,558
the late season i mean i don't even know

872
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,000
if we have rain anymore until like

873
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,158
december so

874
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,599
we don't worry about rain and molds and

875
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,600
things like that it doesn't seem for at

876
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:23,199
least the last 10 years but

877
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,879
um yeah the community here that's uh

878
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,759
that grows and

879
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,600
um just this this is this country's just

880
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,798
beautiful so um

881
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,278
yeah that's why i'm here to grow

882
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:33,278
cannabis

883
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,079
um speaking of microclimates we live on

884
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,398
a north slope where they it's actually

885
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,480
got a nickname of little siberia to the

886
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,038
old timers around here so we actually

887
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,440
have we do have problems with powdery

888
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,960
mildew that i never used to have when i

889
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,679
lived on a hill

890
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,759
where the air drilled away but um

891
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,120
in general it is it's just a perfect

892
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,480
climate um

893
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,439
and i think it's just going to get

894
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,319
better

895
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,320
what do you think wayne

896
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,640
yeah i

897
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,879
i agree one of the things that's really

898
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,440
lovely about cannabis and really diving

899
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,519
into the genetics of cannabis is

900
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,919
genetics from a place like afghanistan

901
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,399
where it's high elevation and they get

902
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,759
10 inches of rain a year are going to be

903
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,558
different they're going to act

904
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,119
differently in your garden than genetics

905
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,759
from places like the cloud forests of

906
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:27,359
colombia for example that could tolerate

907
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,278
a lot of moisture that like you'd find

908
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,879
on the coast of mendocino

909
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,960
but what's beautiful about nevada county

910
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,039
to me is depending on what part of the

911
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,360
county you're in you can get completely

912
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,519
different elevations our farm our little

913
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,839
four acre farm where we've done a lot of

914
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,480
good work over the years uh is it about

915
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:47,199
a thousand meters above sea level and

916
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,319
there's places in nevada county that are

917
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,798
you know

918
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,240
100 feet above sea level

919
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:53,679
and you're going to have really

920
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,599
different growing seasons really

921
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,480
different

922
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,599
opportunities in those different places

923
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,360
and

924
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,719
in my specific case one of the reasons

925
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,199
i'm really excited about living in

926
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,319
nevada county is we were fortunate and

927
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,679
maybe smart enough to buy a good soil

928
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:10,879
because there's a lot of good dirt in

929
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,798
this county

930
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,278
and if you take care of your soil and

931
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:18,319
you feed it and you know for years our

932
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,759
garden got compost and

933
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,398
certain uh

934
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,839
korean natural farming type amendments

935
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,678
and water

936
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,918
never anything on the plant surfaces

937
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,200
itself because we were making medicine

938
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,120
we wanted to make sure that there was

939
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,319
high quality material free of any

940
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,719
contaminants

941
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,558
and meantime again

942
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,558
the the elevation

943
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,879
the length of the season the dryness of

944
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,960
the summer the heat in the day the

945
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,440
coolness of the nights

946
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,840
cannabis is very happy here

947
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,480
that's my experience and that makes me

948
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,918
happy because i love the plant and

949
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,319
when you see them flourish it's a

950
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,320
beautiful sight

951
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,240
speaking of breeding wade i know that

952
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,079
you've done a recent project with the

953
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,079
guys at humboldt season i noticed ben

954
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,720
just walked over here so

955
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:11,199
um tell us a little bit about tell us a

956
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,120
little bit about that project and um

957
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,640
then we'll move on and get get a little

958
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,639
more specific with both these guys too

959
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:21,599
uh yeah that's that's a a wonderful

960
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,120
thing that's happened here

961
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:27,759
um a couple of years ago um

962
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:30,239
a mutual friend between ben and i

963
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,759
uh said that uh

964
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,798
you know you should really consider

965
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:37,200
doing something with these guys and so

966
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,960
uh we sent over uh

967
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,798
four different cuttings

968
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,880
of things that i was working on in the

969
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,558
summer of

970
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,640
2018 i think it was

971
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:52,158
and uh ben took them in and

972
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,000
grew them out and uh

973
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,519
mothered them and

974
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,359
and then meantime yeah we talked about

975
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,919
what was going to happen what what mail

976
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,639
we might use to get and i my interest

977
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,480
for years has been primarily cbd and

978
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,440
what's called the minor cannabinoids if

979
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,278
you will

980
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,760
so um

981
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:12,639
yeah we ended up with three different

982
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,760
lines that are almost guaranteed to be

983
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,559
relatively high in cbd not much thc at

984
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,159
all

985
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:19,039
and there will be other cannabinoids and

986
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,559
there's going to be some really

987
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,239
interesting terpenes

988
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,599
in some of those seeds

989
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,598
so

990
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,599
and i love the model of humboldt seed

991
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,720
company of getting genetics out to

992
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,240
people and let them find the things that

993
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,398
are special for them

994
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:37,678
because we're all different

995
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,960
you can take us the same plant and offer

996
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,960
it to different people and you'll get

997
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,559
different responses to that plant

998
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,398
because our systems are different our

999
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,480
needs are different we should respond

1000
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,799
differently to the cannabis plant and

1001
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,398
it's my sense that it's important to

1002
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,519
give people the opportunity to grow

1003
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:53,279
their own

1004
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:57,280
and find something that really turns you

1005
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,280
on really gets gets your boat going and

1006
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,359
i gotta say if if you're looking for

1007
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,440
things that are gonna get you high

1008
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,799
the cbd trifecta is probably not the one

1009
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,159
you're looking for

1010
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,079
but if you're looking for something that

1011
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:09,920
might help you feel good

1012
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,079
help you join snot ache

1013
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,079
help your digestion work better help you

1014
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,480
sleep better at night all those things

1015
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,680
are definitely possible in those mix of

1016
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,559
seeds and i'm really excited and pleased

1017
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,679
that

1018
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,279
ben has done all of that because it's

1019
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,480
it's always been my goal if you look at

1020
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,839
what happened with harlequin it was

1021
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,960
about give it away to as many people as

1022
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:33,599
possible same thing is happening with

1023
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,480
the seeds thankfully

1024
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,800
i'm learning how to do business

1025
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,679
and ben is selling them for us which is

1026
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,000
really fun it's special i gotta say you

1027
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,919
know after all these years of giving it

1028
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,760
away uh

1029
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,920
and and the goal there all along was to

1030
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,200
give it away so i'm excited by it i'm

1031
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,200
looking forward to hearing reports

1032
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,920
that's awesome wade i'm glad to hear

1033
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,880
that you're monetizing your

1034
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,960
love for the plant and it's getting back

1035
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,880
to you and when i heard that you were

1036
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,960
working with ben and humboldt seas it

1037
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,880
made me feel good because i know it's

1038
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,280
two great members of the community and

1039
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,960
just two really class acts and that's

1040
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,200
one of the things i love about cannabis

1041
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,800
is it brings people together it gives us

1042
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:18,639
opportunities to collaborate that's one

1043
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,920
of my favorite things right now is to be

1044
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,440
able to collaborate with other people

1045
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,639
that are like-minded

1046
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,559
grow genetics and have like a plan like

1047
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,759
not just throwing some wheat out there

1048
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,239
and growing it and hope we're gonna make

1049
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,560
some money but like with intention and

1050
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,319
like hey how's this idea sound like

1051
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,239
let's grow this strain and do this with

1052
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,079
it and make this product with it and

1053
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,439
it's gonna help this group of people and

1054
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,400
it's gonna be great for this this and

1055
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,559
this and

1056
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,320
that's that's what's pretty awesome

1057
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,159
about this plant

1058
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,480
thanks for embracing it

1059
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,639
um so gary i wanted to get a little bit

1060
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,039
specific on on your genetics and

1061
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,480
situations you spoke that you're on a

1062
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,079
north face and

1063
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,079
you know that's that's makes things a

1064
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,680
little bit more challenging and you know

1065
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,320
we're all faced with different issues

1066
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,679
when we grow and um you know tell us a

1067
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,240
little bit what you've learned about

1068
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,759
genetics and like what works for you and

1069
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:09,118
what doesn't work being on the north

1070
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,119
face and like

1071
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,880
also like how's that affect when you

1072
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,119
start and when you finish and things

1073
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,440
like that

1074
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,480
on our farm we tend to not be in a hurry

1075
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,639
to plant

1076
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,320
um i mean it's like when you see people

1077
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,639
buying tomatoes here putting them out in

1078
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,800
the first of may

1079
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,239
it happens every year the people who

1080
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,560
sell tomato plants do a really good

1081
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,479
business in may and june

1082
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:33,519
with the second or third uh yeah that's

1083
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,159
true

1084
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,239
second or third wave of tomatoes but um

1085
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,000
so i usually probably don't put any full

1086
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,598
term plant out until about the first of

1087
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,119
june i know a lot of people do earlier

1088
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,880
than that but that seems to work for us

1089
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,559
every year is just so different here in

1090
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,720
the fall too you talk about the dry

1091
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,599
falls i mean we've had those and we've

1092
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,598
also had rain knock everything down in

1093
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,720
august

1094
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,119
and uh

1095
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,039
so we've gotten really really creative

1096
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,720
with support i'm sure everybody out

1097
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:06,480
there understands what i mean um

1098
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,959
and we've started growing smaller we

1099
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,119
used to grow gigantic plants and you

1100
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,358
know being on a ladder when you're 65

1101
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,160
working on your plants just doesn't work

1102
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,078
so

1103
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,319
so being compact really working on

1104
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,000
pruning all that stuff is so important

1105
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,000
and we all know that i'm talking you

1106
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
know preaching to the choir so um

1107
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,598
that's about all i can say about that

1108
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,279
uh genetics like everybody else we're

1109
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,599
trying new stuff all the time i mean all

1110
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,440
these folks at this event here the

1111
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,440
people from finest i didn't see purple

1112
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,280
city genetics but they're great humble

1113
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,119
seed company is great

1114
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,720
we've tried a little bit from everybody

1115
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,960
and

1116
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,759
it just it's such an evolving thing it

1117
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,838
and the market is so fickle so

1118
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,000
just having all those options out there

1119
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,159
from people and and

1120
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,519
working towards what really works on

1121
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,759
your own farm

1122
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,559
is all you can do i mean it's a it's a

1123
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,720
education every year for me so

1124
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,239
thank you to you know the breeders and

1125
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,239
people coming up with those genetics

1126
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:08,719
that we can have such great stuff to try

1127
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:08,719
now so

1128
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,760
gary this is alan allen has a strain

1129
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,240
that finishes in 43 days you guys might

1130
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,240
want to talk

1131
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,400
actually

1132
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,760
the next thing i was going to get to is

1133
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,680
alan tell us a little bit about some of

1134
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,680
the new strains you're working on

1135
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,159
um tell us you know

1136
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:31,279
your what like really gave you your like

1137
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,078
boost

1138
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,519
um into um you know

1139
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,760
people really knowing who obsolete

1140
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:38,639
genetics was and and like gave you your

1141
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,040
like

1142
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:43,679
you know the genetically like pushed you

1143
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,920
into the you know big big time so to

1144
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,919
speak

1145
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,639
so genetics for me have always been like

1146
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,160
what

1147
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,159
what i just i

1148
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:57,199
i wanted to always smoke like what i

1149
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:59,039
grow and what i breed and a lot of times

1150
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,639
like the market dictated something else

1151
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,279
for many years everybody wanted just

1152
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,679
like og gas and i was more into like

1153
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,519
fruity strains and things that are like

1154
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,358
sipping wine or something and

1155
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:11,358
so for the very beginning of when i was

1156
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,440
breeding it wasn't really successful

1157
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,759
because everybody they wanted that this

1158
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,519
was before extracts came along extracts

1159
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,000
came along and changed the game

1160
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:23,119
but the fuel was all that anybody wanted

1161
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,838
og sour diesel that's it and there was

1162
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,200
so much um

1163
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:28,960
that people were breeding that were all

1164
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,960
homogeneous that were the same and it

1165
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,639
just it's it's like taking all the

1166
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,079
colors on the palette and just wiping

1167
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,078
them together and that's what they came

1168
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,839
up with and a lot of breeders that's all

1169
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,760
they had was just

1170
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,559
another copy of another copy of another

1171
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,319
copy so i i tended to go a different

1172
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,759
direction for what

1173
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:49,279
i wanted not what everyone else wanted

1174
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,880
luckily though that came around and

1175
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,040
changed

1176
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,559
i did a string called

1177
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,039
alien kush

1178
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:59,279
um some years back which was this las

1179
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:02,159
vegas purple kush to this

1180
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,359
um afghani strain that i had got from a

1181
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,118
friend who

1182
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,199
brother came back from afghanistan and

1183
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,200
had a handful of seeds and

1184
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,759
and they're just a land race afghan i

1185
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:14,639
crossed to this las vegas purple cush

1186
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,359
and at the time on the forums on the

1187
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,480
forum boards online

1188
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:19,920
there hadn't

1189
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,559
no one had seen anything that had as

1190
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,400
much frost that early on

1191
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:26,318
and that kind of literally just lit the

1192
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,480
fire under my ass as being somebody that

1193
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:30,079
had something different and new and

1194
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,119
fresh

1195
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,839
other than that what really kind of

1196
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,800
pushed me further up into

1197
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:38,078
i don't know

1198
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,240
i don't know how to say it but the

1199
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,280
orange cookies basically

1200
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:43,279
um

1201
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,359
became famous because of

1202
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,480
the jungle boys who are a big grower out

1203
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:48,318
of

1204
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,280
los angeles and they were doing a lot of

1205
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:53,440
promotions and we had this opening night

1206
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,440
where we did a orange cookie tasting and

1207
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,920
this was the first time we'd seen like

1208
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,159
people like lined up for blocks long in

1209
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,318
downtown l.a to come to this

1210
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:04,399
this tasting because it was so hyped

1211
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,358
online so

1212
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,880
what began after that is like this high

1213
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,480
almost like um

1214
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,400
i can't say all breeders but a lot of

1215
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,639
breeders were just chasing the next

1216
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,720
thing that people wanted and it's i

1217
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:17,679
don't think it was necessarily something

1218
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:19,439
that they

1219
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,960
were passionate about it was just more

1220
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,440
of like um

1221
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,000
a money grab so to speak because

1222
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,119
when the price of cannabis started to

1223
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,039
crash

1224
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,519
a lot of people stopped growing cannabis

1225
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,880
and jumped into

1226
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,400
the extract

1227
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,680
game like all of a sudden now we got

1228
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,599
millions of extractors you know

1229
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:40,318
everybody converted from being a grower

1230
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,079
to an extractor and then from that that

1231
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:45,440
market got flooded and then the next

1232
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,200
thing was everybody became seed breeders

1233
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,039
and so you had a lot of people that were

1234
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,279
buying a pack of seeds from

1235
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,039
a breeder it doesn't matter what breeder

1236
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,280
but now that one pack of seeds has

1237
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,599
created a brand new company and so they

1238
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,920
really didn't do a lot of their own work

1239
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,119
they furthered someone else's work and

1240
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,960
that's where i say that everything

1241
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,960
became homogeneous because they were

1242
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,519
using the same shit that everybody else

1243
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,519
was using

1244
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,519
it's tough now and if you really want to

1245
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,720
make a living you almost have to find

1246
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,039
yourself

1247
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:16,239
chasing what it is the market wants

1248
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,400
currently it's

1249
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,479
purple rock hard

1250
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,079
smells like gelato i mean that's the

1251
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,400
only thing that sells right now so if

1252
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,560
you're on at the mercy of the market and

1253
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,639
you're not vertically integrated you

1254
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,838
have to chase what that

1255
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,838
in flavor is that's dictated by

1256
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,480
people in new york or you know some rap

1257
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,920
star or something so

1258
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,480
but

1259
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,159
i still do what i like to do because i

1260
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,519
just hate falling into just doing the

1261
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:45,440
same thing that everybody else wants to

1262
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:47,280
do i do flavors that are people like oh

1263
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,358
that's that's like jack or something

1264
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,119
like yeah but i like it you know so

1265
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:53,679
that's why i do it because it's what i

1266
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,680
like and what i want to smoke and i just

1267
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:57,598
like flavors too like i probably have

1268
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,399
200 jars of fresh wheat at home all

1269
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,559
different flavors and and it never gets

1270
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,639
old every day with dinner popping in

1271
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:07,279
different jars like sipping wine you

1272
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:10,719
know that's what genetics are to me is

1273
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,800
like the variety and and stuff that you

1274
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:15,039
know obviously is different i do like

1275
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,760
the new stuff that everybody likes the

1276
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:19,679
gelato purple stuff it's it's pleasing

1277
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,560
but it gets boring so

1278
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:22,719
um

1279
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:24,719
that's pretty much what genetics are to

1280
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:29,118
me as far as you know

1281
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:31,439
um what's going on currently uh

1282
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,318
going to work for steezy and going to be

1283
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,639
doing their entire palette of genetics

1284
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:40,000
i'm excited because i don't have to fall

1285
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:43,039
into just one category to breed for

1286
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,639
or to final hunt for so they have a

1287
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,559
they want anything and everything as

1288
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,039
long as it's good so it

1289
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,679
it's it's nice to be able to finally

1290
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:54,159
break out of these these like lanes that

1291
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:56,480
you have to stay in to be a a super

1292
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:59,358
successful breeder these days and and

1293
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,318
just chasing that one flavor and and by

1294
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,078
the time

1295
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:03,838
a lot of people get this flavor it

1296
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,880
changes and then you're you're behind

1297
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:06,880
the gun again so

1298
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,119
i uh

1299
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,039
i think that uh the flavors are the

1300
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,039
spice of life and i'm not gonna

1301
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:17,519
find myself just hunting one thing

1302
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:20,719
because some rap star says that's what

1303
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,719
everybody should be smoking

1304
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,400
what's going to be the popular strain

1305
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:31,199
gelato

1306
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:36,078
it's gonna be the same

1307
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,359
that's funny i was i was just thinking

1308
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,839
when he was talking that i was gonna

1309
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,920
bring up that you know you know and i

1310
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:44,400
think gelato is a great strain and

1311
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,720
there's some great things about it but

1312
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,599
what i'm seeing right now in cannabis is

1313
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:48,959
like

1314
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,039
everyone's complaining that things

1315
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,800
aren't selling and the prices are down

1316
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,960
so people are like changing the way that

1317
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,119
they grow to a cheaper way and maybe

1318
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,440
using not as good ingredients

1319
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,160
and and now what we have right now is a

1320
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,880
huge amount of mediocracy

1321
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,598
so like how many people can grow a

1322
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,480
gelato cross with athena

1323
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,000
and then wonder why it doesn't sell

1324
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,719
i mean

1325
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,880
let's mix it up a little people

1326
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:19,679
so just recently i had the pleasure of

1327
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,358
um judging flowers at the ego clash

1328
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,118
which meant that i had to smoke 30

1329
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,000
joints within an hour and judge this

1330
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,880
stuff

1331
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,519
and

1332
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,440
it was brutal but uh it got to the point

1333
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:32,079
where you know we everyone that was

1334
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,800
judging also had entered i could not

1335
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,560
pick out my own weed because i grew for

1336
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,680
what the market was

1337
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:42,480
demanding some lemon cherry gelato

1338
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:45,199
every of all 30 there was only one that

1339
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,838
stood out different everything else was

1340
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:48,879
some kind of a gelato it was like one

1341
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,318
big

1342
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,318
pool that everybody just threw their

1343
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:53,279
butts in and it all came out the same

1344
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:54,880
like

1345
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,960
we sat around the table and like could

1346
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,240
you recognize your weed and like none of

1347
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,800
us could it was all the same so there's

1348
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,519
definitely a need for some

1349
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,519
something to change

1350
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,118
yep so

1351
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:14,799
if you're looking for um a quick easy

1352
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,680
scheme growing cannabis isn't it

1353
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,680
um

1354
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,679
and if you are even just wanting to have

1355
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,440
longevity in cannabis

1356
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,639
you gotta really think outside the box

1357
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,720
you gotta mix it up you gotta you know

1358
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:29,519
the thing that all the gentlemen here

1359
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,679
are just saying that really resonates is

1360
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,679
that they're doing it for their love for

1361
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,279
the love of the plant and they're doing

1362
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:37,679
it for the right reasons

1363
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,440
like like alan was saying like they're

1364
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,679
these guys who breed to try to like get

1365
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,000
ahead of the curve and and think that

1366
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:46,078
what are people gonna like next year

1367
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,800
you know sure as a business you gotta

1368
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,800
have that in mind but on the other hand

1369
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,720
if you really love cannabis and you

1370
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,640
really want to like

1371
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:58,318
take it to the next level you gotta

1372
00:47:54,639 --> 00:48:01,199
diversify yourself and not necessarily

1373
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,719
do what you think that clout is and do

1374
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:03,838
what you think is right and go with your

1375
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:04,799
heart

1376
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:05,838
so

1377
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,480
you know

1378
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:10,078
follow follow your passion and

1379
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,000
you know i think the people

1380
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,680
right now who are struggling in cannabis

1381
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,838
are probably the ones who are the most

1382
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:18,879
passionate about it that it makes it

1383
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:21,679
hard but i think if everybody just

1384
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,880
you know stick sticks with it

1385
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:27,199
don't let it bring you down because

1386
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,599
push comes to shove

1387
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:31,598
someday people are going to realize that

1388
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,960
you know the difference between craft

1389
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,119
cannabis is going to be like the

1390
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,639
difference between

1391
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,480
budweiser and craft beers so i'm not a

1392
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,400
huge beer drinker so i'm not even sure

1393
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,559
if that analogy is great but

1394
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,800
i think there is i think there is a big

1395
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:49,519
differentiation and i think

1396
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,079
that when when that you know when people

1397
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,440
realized the difference between a good

1398
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,960
beer and

1399
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,679
you know a course

1400
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,720
like it opened some minds and cannabis

1401
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:02,480
right now the way the way i see it is

1402
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:04,399
you know it's such a new

1403
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,318
industry and it's so new to like the

1404
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,599
public and people walking to dispensary

1405
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,519
and they're just like

1406
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,039
what i can go buy cannabis on the shelf

1407
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:11,759
and there's all these cannabis products

1408
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:13,279
and

1409
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,319
it's just kind of like

1410
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,400
so wild that they're not quite in the

1411
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:20,000
mindset where they are like when they go

1412
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,358
grocery shopping

1413
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,280
so i feel like that's one of the things

1414
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,480
i personally want more as one of my

1415
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,160
missions and

1416
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,000
if you know who i am you know you know i

1417
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,639
like i'm pretty true to it

1418
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,079
is like convincing people that using the

1419
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,159
right ingredients

1420
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,039
growing organically

1421
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:39,519
is like really important because number

1422
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:41,599
one it brings out what the plant has to

1423
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:43,199
offer number two it's better for the

1424
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,480
environment number three you're not

1425
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,039
supporting

1426
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,039
some you know huge chemical industry

1427
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,159
that is going to be the downfall of our

1428
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:51,358
planet

1429
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:54,078
so

1430
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:57,598
you know be mindful of your purchases

1431
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,880
and be mindful of how you grow

1432
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,000
so

1433
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,039
i don't want to talk too much because

1434
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,679
i'm a moderator so

1435
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:07,920
let's let's uh pass the mic and

1436
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:09,598
other things i was thinking about on my

1437
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,720
list of questions

1438
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,599
um

1439
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:16,239
if you were to pick another place other

1440
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:19,440
than nevada county to grow

1441
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:19,439
where would that be and why

1442
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,719
anyway

1443
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,880
probably rogue river or humboldt

1444
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:32,799
somewhere

1445
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,000
yeah just north anywhere north i don't

1446
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,680
like south i like north

1447
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,960
i i'm going to decline to state i'm

1448
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:41,838
going to stay right here i think we've

1449
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,838
got it made here

1450
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,200
yeah i tend to go with gary i traveled

1451
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:48,239
the world quite a bit when i was younger

1452
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:50,480
and

1453
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:53,358
this is a special spot

1454
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,838
if i had to be someplace else it might

1455
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:55,838
be spain

1456
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,480
because they have a pretty good cannabis

1457
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,880
thing going and

1458
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,719
some really beautiful people

1459
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,720
[Music]

1460
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:09,838
but yeah i'm kind of with gary this is

1461
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:09,838
this is the winner for me

1462
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,159
right here in nevada county

1463
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,598
well i guess it's unanimous

1464
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,118
yeah i think we're all pretty blessed

1465
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,800
and whatever it was that attracted us

1466
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,960
all to this great area and great

1467
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,359
community you know

1468
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,199
we're we're lucky we're blessed and

1469
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:33,199
it seems like everyone feels like

1470
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,519
they're putting roots in and

1471
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,679
i think long-term nevada county is to

1472
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:40,400
make make a serious impression on

1473
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:42,000
california kind of how napa and sonoma

1474
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,920
did in the wine thing

1475
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,920
you know i feel like we're the underdog

1476
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,680
because people think of outdoor cannabis

1477
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,880
and they think of humboldt and

1478
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:52,558
mendocino until they see our flowers and

1479
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,400
then they're like whoa

1480
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,079
so uh

1481
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,599
you know i'm not sure if anybody else

1482
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,119
has anything they would like to talk

1483
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,200
about but

1484
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,880
i feel like we've covered a lot and

1485
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,558
we've got a great bunch of people here

1486
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,039
growing in nevada county

1487
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,079
i feel honored

1488
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:12,079
and yeah that's good great idea alan

1489
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,318
let's open up the um

1490
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,318
the field to some questions anybody out

1491
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:19,838
there have a question they want to show

1492
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:19,838
throw at any of these gentlemen

1493
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,240
uh your go ahead right here in the front

1494
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,960
yes

1495
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,480
thyme oil

1496
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,480
yeah i have some

1497
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,319
um i mean

1498
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:02,239
for botrytis i think you know one of the

1499
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:04,400
most important things you could do early

1500
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:07,439
on is getting a really good microbial

1501
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,800
population in the soil

1502
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,920
regalia is a great product to prevent it

1503
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:17,200
armory is also has like six or seven

1504
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,200
species of bacillus

1505
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,160
i'm not familiar with that one but

1506
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:34,000
time oil isn't necessarily a bad thing

1507
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,119
you just got to be careful that because

1508
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,760
it could be phytotoxic it could cause

1509
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:39,920
phytotoxicity

1510
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,920
so

1511
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,760
yeah i was going gonna say even like the

1512
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,400
first week of flower

1513
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,800
get get an application in keep the rate

1514
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,400
low so you don't have it on there the

1515
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,640
oil on there like

1516
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,200
in the hot sun just turning into a

1517
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:57,838
magnifying glass making it you know

1518
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:57,838
worse

1519
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:01,920
yeah

1520
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:04,318
the moisture is definitely always a

1521
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,318
challenge

1522
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,960
the other thing is do a little research

1523
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,519
you know there's some strains that are

1524
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,720
more botrytis resistant than others

1525
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:24,639
um because you know i've seen i've seen

1526
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,480
in the same garden one strain have it

1527
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:27,759
and one not so

1528
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,559
that's one of my suggestions you guys

1529
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,839
haven't yet anyone else have any

1530
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,160
tips

1531
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:34,159
tips

1532
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,640
just kidding

1533
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,639
that's

1534
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,798
uh luck

1535
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,160
i don't a friend of mine up here his

1536
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:58,079
good friend that he went to college with

1537
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,159
is director of operations

1538
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,599
we were at a park had a barbecue and i

1539
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:04,000
brought some nuggets and he's like oh my

1540
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,760
god i got to show these to jay so

1541
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,760
he told us he said jay i got this guy

1542
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,799
that does genetics so they vetted me

1543
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,559
came

1544
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:11,920
looked at my history and

1545
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,798
and uh

1546
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:18,119
came at me with a good offer so shrine

1547
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,119
group yeah

1548
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,480
all right

1549
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,720
probably have my genetics in there very

1550
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,719
soon

1551
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,159
goes the show flowers opens doors go

1552
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:33,159
ahead sir

1553
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,200
so the the orange was an old school it

1554
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:02,558
was

1555
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:04,558
called orange juice that came out of

1556
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,880
garberville my mom was a bartender in

1557
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:10,400
garberville and my stepfather was a

1558
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,000
gorilla grower up in that area and

1559
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,920
in high school i went there and i said

1560
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,599
you know i need some i need some seeds

1561
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,880
dean that was my stepfather and he gave

1562
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,519
me these

1563
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,960
orange juice seeds and then so which i

1564
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:25,358
think is probably california orange bud

1565
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,119
um or what became california orange but

1566
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:29,440
that was i think orange

1567
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,039
butt was pretty prevalent in humble in

1568
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,559
that period

1569
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,239
so uh

1570
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,839
i had those seeds for years and years

1571
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:37,358
and years and then i got the forum girl

1572
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:40,000
scout cookies and at the time i was like

1573
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:41,679
wow this is some great stuff you know so

1574
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,880
one thing led to another i popped some

1575
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,798
of the the orange juice bud seeds and

1576
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,358
and i i had a few strains at the time

1577
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:50,159
and i put that on the girl scout cookies

1578
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:51,679
and

1579
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:53,039
man it turned out phenomenal you know it

1580
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:56,960
was just one of those things it was kind

1581
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:58,480
of an accident but it i mean it was

1582
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,519
it was an accident but it wasn't an

1583
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,119
accident i don't know how to explain

1584
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:02,719
that you know like it turned out because

1585
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,160
a lot of times you can put two good

1586
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,399
things together and think that they're

1587
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:08,639
gonna create magic and they don't they

1588
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,519
just don't and then that's like having

1589
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:10,558
you know

1590
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:12,798
uh

1591
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:16,000
two ugly people that have a beautiful

1592
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:18,079
baby or like vice versa you know two hot

1593
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,318
people come together and the baby's butt

1594
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,318
ugly you know like and no grandma ever

1595
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:24,239
says like oh that kid's ugly and they're

1596
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:27,039
always like oh that my grandkids the

1597
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:29,519
greatest kid in the world so uh but

1598
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,039
anyway so um yeah that was orange

1599
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,519
cookies

1600
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,119
in a in a nutshell so to speak

1601
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:37,119
yeah

1602
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:39,200
so obviously you had intention for what

1603
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,880
it to be but you know when you when you

1604
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:41,519
breed you never know what the outcome is

1605
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,358
and

1606
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:45,119
that's that's one of the things that

1607
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:48,000
keeps us all going is like the

1608
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,000
excitement of it all

1609
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:52,480
as far as breeding goes like yeah you

1610
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,319
don't know the outcome but in years and

1611
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,079
years of experience you can start

1612
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:57,679
estimating what the outcome will be

1613
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,760
closer and closer

1614
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:03,199
so um

1615
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:05,359
and it is it's it's kind of uh art and

1616
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:07,358
it's also kind of science and it's a

1617
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:09,039
little bit luck

1618
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:11,199
there's heartache and tears like

1619
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:12,159
especially if you start doing feminized

1620
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:15,199
pollen

1621
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:15,920
um the the success rate's low at first

1622
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:18,159
and

1623
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,318
you spend months like flowering things

1624
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:24,000
out and then wow you get no seeds out of

1625
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:26,000
it so and it's it's a a room filled with

1626
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,679
you know 40 different plants and there's

1627
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,079
not enough to make a pound of anything

1628
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:31,279
so you can go broke real fast trying to

1629
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,160
be a breeder

1630
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,160
um but you know and it just ta it was a

1631
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,239
big leap of faith because i did flowers

1632
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:40,239
to you know like most people

1633
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,078
in the white market now they started

1634
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:44,000
somewhere wherever we do we all did we

1635
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,480
grew flowers and out in the field in the

1636
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,280
greenhouse indoor to put a roof over our

1637
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,000
head

1638
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,000
and and our meal on the table

1639
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,760
but it was uh

1640
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,318
it was pretty scary when i decided to

1641
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,359
stop growing flour and just do seed only

1642
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:00,400
and

1643
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:02,159
i'm glad i did it because it just opens

1644
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,160
so many more flavors and that's really

1645
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:06,318
what i love about the plant in the first

1646
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:07,679
place is just being able to

1647
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:09,519
um

1648
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,519
understand it better through this

1649
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:14,000
breeding process and seeing how the the

1650
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:15,519
progeny come out from what you think is

1651
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,960
going to be good and then when it

1652
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:18,798
doesn't come out you just have these

1653
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,639
high hopes and you're like why didn't it

1654
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:22,639
work maybe i go the opposite direction

1655
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:25,358
and reverse this one or try some

1656
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:29,118
different pollen but it uh it takes

1657
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:31,920
years of of watching the plant and

1658
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:34,318
and doing having a lot of failure to

1659
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,680
breed in order to figure out what really

1660
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:37,039
works and

1661
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:39,039
and

1662
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:40,960
what will be desirable not only for you

1663
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:46,440
but hopefully

1664
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,440
the the community accepts it well too

1665
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,039
i wanted to add on with what alan was

1666
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:54,318
saying just a minute ago about what

1667
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,318
works for you

1668
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:58,639
because i think that's part of how you

1669
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,159
find something unique it's

1670
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:01,838
not just that it's different than the

1671
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:04,078
other things that you've experienced or

1672
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:04,960
looked at or played with but that

1673
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,200
it

1674
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,199
like for me there's been

1675
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,318
i don't know half dozen times in my

1676
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:13,358
breeding

1677
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:16,480
where a specific plant really called out

1678
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:17,838
to me really spoke to me loud and clear

1679
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,440
pay attention

1680
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:21,119
work with me

1681
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,039
and i think that's some of what alan's

1682
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,760
referring to that there's something

1683
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,519
within you that responds to that plant

1684
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,559
and i do think there's a back and forth

1685
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:32,079
communication if we are open to it

1686
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,760
and i think

1687
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,960
nevada county is the kind of place where

1688
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,599
folks are open to that kind of

1689
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,599
conversation

1690
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,279
yeah i was going to say that sparked a

1691
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:46,159
word that popped into my mind the

1692
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,960
intuition of a grower and of a breeder

1693
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:48,879
and

1694
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,639
like having that connection with a plant

1695
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,079
is a pretty special thing and not

1696
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:54,879
everybody has that

1697
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,640
but if you do have that you know it's a

1698
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,240
pretty amazing feeling when you have

1699
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:59,920
that connection

1700
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:01,519
and when things work out how you

1701
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,400
expected it

1702
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:05,400
any other questions out there

1703
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,358
sure let's let's all give a two quick

1704
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:25,440
couple seconds about that

1705
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:27,279
thanks great question obviously

1706
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,760
everybody always wants to have that you

1707
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,760
know conversation with people i really

1708
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:36,079
love og strain i love sour diesel

1709
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,160
og's definitely like something that

1710
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,440
really resonated with me always and

1711
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:41,039
still does

1712
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,639
in fact i'm growing a bunch of og this

1713
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:44,798
year and i feel like the world we need

1714
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:46,000
to bring og back

1715
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,159
there's

1716
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,798
no disrespect to gelato but

1717
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,679
we've got to break it up a little bit

1718
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:53,519
and then

1719
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:54,798
way back i used to grow a couple strains

1720
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:56,000
that took a really long time and i

1721
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:57,838
haven't grown them in a long time but

1722
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,519
i've been really getting the urge um the

1723
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:01,519
ds i don't know if anybody remembers

1724
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:04,719
that it was colombian haze people called

1725
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:07,119
it the dog shit or the dreadlock strain

1726
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:08,719
and it took uh it took like 10 12 weeks

1727
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,640
to flower

1728
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:12,159
but it had a super unique nose like

1729
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,318
really pungent

1730
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:16,000
and and then i at the same time when i

1731
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,480
was growing that strain i grew the cough

1732
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,920
which is the nl5 crossed with the haze

1733
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,199
and that took around the same amount of

1734
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,358
time and

1735
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:25,279
amazing flower like it was pretty

1736
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:26,880
popular in this area for a little while

1737
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,160
some of us people have been around a

1738
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,318
little while remember the days of the

1739
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:31,118
cough um you know you used to be able to

1740
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:33,119
like

1741
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,720
grow a plant in a 15 gallon pot and it

1742
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,880
would take you know

1743
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:38,719
three months four months to

1744
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,440
grow at four months i guess

1745
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:43,439
and um but you know you get so much

1746
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,798
flour and back then it was like so

1747
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,000
unique and

1748
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:48,719
there wasn't a whole lot of people

1749
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,679
growing hazel's then and

1750
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:51,598
so

1751
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:53,519
i feel like i need to get back to some

1752
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,200
of those things i've definitely

1753
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,119
experimented with all kinds of stuff

1754
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:58,798
growing lots of cookies lots of gelatos

1755
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,000
skittles and all those things and

1756
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:00,960
they're fun

1757
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,838
but

1758
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,798
og and hazes are definitely something

1759
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:06,400
that

1760
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:10,639
reaches uh

1761
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,639
something special in a bone inside of me

1762
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,440
i'd say the

1763
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:18,798
the one thing that marked me for life

1764
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:22,000
was malawi gold which is a it was a

1765
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:24,318
african land race that took 145 days

1766
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,239
indoors to flower

1767
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:27,038
it looked terrible

1768
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:29,598
but

1769
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,839
it got you so freaking high was that it

1770
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:33,440
was like being on the verge of starting

1771
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:36,318
a mushroom trip

1772
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,400
and it had this really distinctive

1773
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:41,279
grated carrot smell

1774
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,480
um other than that the the chem dog d

1775
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,200
when it first came to northern

1776
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,760
california just like rock my boots like

1777
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:51,038
most potent shit ever and smelled like

1778
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,200
some old bum sock or something but

1779
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:56,000
the the worse the description of the

1780
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:59,838
strain the better it is to smoke so

1781
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,719
but yeah those are my two

1782
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:04,558
i've got some uh older uh cherry pie and

1783
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:06,719
i just love the cherry pie man that's

1784
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:08,798
just got the the terps on that just are

1785
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:11,038
just like i want to eat it

1786
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:13,440
so i keep that one going and then i'm a

1787
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,039
sucker for old school blue dream i mean

1788
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,119
blue dream just the way it grows you

1789
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,400
know it's just seems spindly and like

1790
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,760
you're thinking well i'm going to pull

1791
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,000
those plants and the next thing you know

1792
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,799
they're just ginormous

1793
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,960
and

1794
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:27,838
it's just a great smoke too so those are

1795
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,838
mine too

1796
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:31,279
um

1797
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,558
well back in the days when i smoked

1798
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,960
flour

1799
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,960
um

1800
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:41,440
i had a cultivar

1801
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:43,680
called genius that uh was pretty popular

1802
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,079
and i enjoyed smoking it and it was very

1803
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:48,239
intense high experience

1804
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,960
uh down in the bay area

1805
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:50,959
like you allen

1806
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,759
then started working with

1807
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:58,078
what's now known as the pre-98 bubba

1808
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,079
kush

1809
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:03,279
and then when i started making hash

1810
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:05,199
seriously

1811
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,359
tried to make a living growing sour

1812
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:09,919
diesel indoors

1813
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:11,038
because it makes such great hash

1814
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,920
uh

1815
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,440
glossy black beautiful

1816
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,440
anyway

1817
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,400
uh

1818
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:23,920
so nowadays yeah i uh all of the

1819
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,039
the currently popular uh flower types i

1820
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,680
mostly

1821
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:30,000
again look for the extractions and the

1822
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:33,199
the hash or rosin that's made from them

1823
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,679
and i don't have a specific particular

1824
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:38,879
favorite flavor there i recently tried

1825
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:40,000
some strawberry banana rosin that was

1826
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,480
very nice

1827
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,880
i also like the fruity things

1833
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:59,199
and grow ac dc in nevada county

1834
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:02,159
it's not good here it's much better on

1835
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:02,159
the mendocino coast

1836
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:09,038
tell me this um i have a cross that's

1837
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:11,280
acdc and um blueberry from uh dj short

1839
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:16,920
grows great here but it's just a it's a

1840
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,920
half and half cross huh

1841
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,159
those sound very interesting gentlemen

1842
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,159
anybody else have any questions

1843
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:30,318
well

1844
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,318
i'm sure we'll share

1845
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,358
yes sir

1846
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:38,880
so you know i know we all kind of run

1847
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:42,759
different fertilizers and different

1848
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,760
inputs and stuff curiosity

1849
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:54,480
i'm 100 organic always as as most people

1850
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,599
uh know about me i own vital garden

1851
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,639
supply

1852
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:00,720
so

1853
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:02,239
i recommend using rs fertilizers

1854
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:03,519
i'll pass the mic down the line so i

1855
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:07,038
don't look like i'm

1856
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:10,239
doing too much of a commercial here

1857
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:12,480
i use a lot of vital earth products

1858
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:13,439
but i also use a lot of other stuff too

1859
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,318
so

1860
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,760
no bad chemicals but i do like some of

1861
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,558
the production stuff is done with

1862
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:23,680
rockwool and salts just because the

1863
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:25,280
it's just it's brainless simple it works

1864
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:27,199
and it's just for production it's not

1865
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,880
for smoking or anything like that

1866
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:30,399
um

1867
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,559
uh yeah

1868
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,720
if there's a way to grow i've done it

1869
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:36,720
like bury a body in the ground and bear

1870
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:38,480
grow over that i've done it like you

1871
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,879
know my grandfather used to bury a dead

1872
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,798
cat and a dog doberman pincher and an

1873
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,838
apple tree grew like crazy so i figured

1874
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:45,838
it's got to work so

1875
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,159
we're we're totally organic here too are

1876
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,920
we planting the ground um our foothill

1877
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:53,759
soil are you from up here do you live up

1878
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,000
here

1879
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,400
yeah up here at you know our soil mostly

1880
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,280
came from decomposed granite so if you

1881
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,880
just don't add organic matter or a good

1882
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,559
compost to it in a couple of years

1883
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,838
you've got like sand

1884
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:10,720
so i always organic compost every year i

1885
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:12,400
top dress with that and um i don't know

1886
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,239
if you guys sell this or not but there's

1887
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,079
a compressed chicken pellet that

1888
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:18,079
stutzman makes two three four or

1889
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:20,318
something like that for a low potency

1890
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:22,880
but uh

1891
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,798
yeah very similar but um but low you

1892
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,119
know not heavy on the fertilizer at all

1893
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:28,640
just just what they need and uh what

1894
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:30,640
else do we use

1895
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,759
up here we need oyster shell lime and

1896
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,759
soft rock phosphate

1897
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,560
um

1898
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,880
because i'm no longer a production

1899
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,640
farmer it's what i'm going to say is a

1900
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,079
lot easier to achieve

1901
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,039
but

1902
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:48,719
because i have always grown cannabis for

1903
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:51,198
making medicine

1904
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:53,838
i wanted to make my own inputs i didn't

1905
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:55,599
want to buy things because

1906
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:58,960
like one of my favorite lines is what

1907
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,719
does inner ingredients mean

1908
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,319
right you're going to spray that on a

1909
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,640
plant that you're going to make oil from

1910
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:08,960
and give it to a child no

1911
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:10,079
so uh i do a lot i uh lactobacillus

1912
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,119
cultures

1913
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,719
uh knfimo one and two is mostly what i

1914
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:15,599
do i haven't gotten into three and four

1915
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,520
yet

1916
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,480
uh because i get such good results with

1917
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,600
those

1918
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:23,119
um and those and again the soil here i

1919
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,600
have red clay

1920
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:28,158
it's no longer red it's dark dark

1921
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,600
beautiful brown soil in our garden

1922
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:32,399
because for years

1923
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,600
we've just added layers of compost and

1924
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,479
mulch

1925
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,880
occasional worm castings cover crops top

1926
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,879
and drop more mulch that kind of thing

1927
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,880
making a lasagna bed

1928
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:46,239
where when you take a plant and plug it

1929
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,119
into a spot in the ground its roots will

1930
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:49,439
find

1931
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:51,519
the layer in the soil that works for

1932
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:54,399
that plant and then they take off and

1933
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,840
they they will literally make a net

1934
01:09:54,399 --> 01:10:00,079
that ends up a net of roots in the soil

1935
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,760
that ends up being as big as the plant

1936
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:03,119
is above the soil

1937
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,880
and so

1938
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:06,880
uh for years we haven't tilled our

1939
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,199
garden we just do the things i just

1940
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,079
described and so

1941
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:13,119
once in a while we'll add azomite

1942
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:15,679
you know

1943
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:18,319
to supplement some minor minerals that

1944
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,840
our soil is somewhat deficient in uh

1945
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:22,799
soil tests

1946
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:26,279
several times say our our particular

1947
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,279
soil is

1948
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:48,519
they say the best fertilizer is the

1949
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:48,519
farmer's shadow
