1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,979
[Music]

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:23,079
[Music]

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,119
we're going to cover some topics we're

4
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,039
going to cover history of genetics we're

5
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,799
going to talk about organic biology and

6
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,640
and how it how it impacts cannabis we're

7
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,640
going to talk about appellations

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
and we can weave all this together into

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,960
a into a big web but any point in time

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,558
man just make sure you stop somebody and

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,878
get access to a mic if you want us to

12
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,959
stop and cover topic or go into

13
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,238
something or anything like that because

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,079
that's the whole point of it is that

15
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,439
it's it's really

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,840
trying to share the information that

17
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,640
we've gathered over these years so that

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,559
as a group as a as a cultivation

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,478
culture we can actually do better

20
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,920
together so with that in mind i will

21
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,039
introduce mowgli

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,400
and jeff

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,080
and justin and i'm going to let them

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,760
just give a quick little little blast on

25
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,879
themselves because otherwise i won't

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
cover them correctly so mowgli

27
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,359
yeah

28
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,079
i'm the ceo of philos we're a cannabis

29
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,000
genomics company based out of portland

30
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,079
oregon we're working on

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,599
sequencing the dna of all the cannabis

32
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,319
in the world and figuring out what the

33
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:33,199
hell we're actually smoking at any given

34
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:36,239
time which is still to this day of

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,920
mystery to a lot of us

36
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,798
we have testing tools that are just

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
meant to help growers and we're working

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,520
on

39
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,798
helping people do really advanced plant

40
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,039
breeding

41
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,280
to bring this plant into the future make

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,200
it work better for growers

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,759
make it less susceptible to powdery

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,079
mildew and flower earlier and all those

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,280
things that every other crop has been

46
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,118
through all this science and they've

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,399
been incredibly advanced by it and

48
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,920
cannabis hasn't had access to that

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,118
and our whole our whole work really

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,478
you're going to hear about a lot of

51
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:07,359
things that intersect with this on this

52
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,080
panel

53
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,080
is to bring all that science

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,239
without fucking everything up in the way

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,160
that that science typically fucks

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,400
everything up you know so there's all

57
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,520
this diversity there's all this subtlety

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,439
there's all this stuff that's not

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,920
science there's all this stuff that has

60
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,878
to do with flavor and feeling and

61
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,039
history and culture

62
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,280
and it's like so how do we you know and

63
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,000
then there's a world of people out there

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,759
in canada mainly who just want the

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,878
biggest plant that yields the most oil

66
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,679
that they get the most single

67
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,840
cannabinoids out of

68
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,599
but that's you know and that will happen

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,080
right so how do we do all the science

70
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,318
that can drive that and and turn it in a

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,080
different direction so we're actually

72
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,359
bringing out the full richness of the

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,680
plant

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,000
that so that's our challenge

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,120
uh i'm kevin jodry founder of wonderland

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,360
nursery um i usually say career hustler

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,039
because that seems how i got here

78
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
but uh basically a lifetime of being

79
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,959
involved in cannabis i was a young guy

80
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,639
on the east coast i was involved in what

81
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,158
we called in criminal cannabis and i got

82
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,679
to see an unbelievable amount of

83
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,679
cannabis as a young guy coming into the

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,879
country through my neighborhood

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,599
and it it absolutely uh changed my life

86
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,598
in terms of i was just fascinated and

87
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,479
over the course of the last you know 40

88
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,959
years

89
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,439
that's been really the chase is to is to

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,878
better understand cannabis and

91
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,120
over the last couple years i say the

92
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,639
last 11 it was involved in legitimate

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
industry

94
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,238
regulated industry

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,318
and to trying to figure out how do you

96
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,158
maintain those cultural connections and

97
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,759
how do you keep the quality present and

98
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,120
at the same time how do you really share

99
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,039
the information with other people so

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,360
that you leave a legacy of people who

101
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,560
follow you and so

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:55,280
my direction has been that and it's been

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:59,438
a very interesting ride to say the least

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,840
my name is jeff lowenfels and in 1975 i

105
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,158
was in alaska and the supreme court

106
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,680
decided that you could do anything you

107
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,959
wanted in the privacy of your home

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,560
including smoking cannabis and so as an

109
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,080
assistant attorney general i helped

110
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,280
write the opinion

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,120
as to where you have a right to privacy

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,798
uh so that you could smoke cannabis in

113
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,720
your tent

114
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,638
or in your hotel room

115
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,400
uh we couldn't quite get a phone booth

116
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,319
that wasn't didn't work the

117
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,519
cars didn't work anyway but uh so so

118
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,000
i've been fooling around with cannabis

119
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,560
since 1975 and before

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,560
um and uh

121
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,240
somewhere along the line i started to

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,079
write a book on

123
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,040
uh organics

124
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,439
and resulted in teaming with microbes

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,120
and then one day i decided i needed to

126
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,680
figure out how plants eat and that

127
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,600
resulted in teeming with nutrients and

128
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,519
then one day i decided that not enough

129
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,840
people knew about mycorrhizal fungi and

130
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,680
how how it was so effective in growing

131
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,159
things and so i wrote a third book so i

132
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,840
have three books um whereas i used to

133
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,080
have two and i was america's dirtiest

134
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,198
lawyer i now have three books which

135
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,560
makes me

136
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,360
lord of the roots sorry um

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,000
and i'm very interested in organics i'm

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,240
very interested in making sure

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,199
that when the big guys come in the

140
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,360
little guys don't get pushed out

141
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,919
and i am very very interested in making

142
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:27,100
sure that we never again

143
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:32,000
let the government prohibit cannabis so

144
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,240
[Applause]

145
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,720
my name is justin calvino

146
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,840
i every time i i'm with kevin i realize

147
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,960
like

148
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:43,519
in 94 i started selling cannabis on a

149
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,519
fair street

150
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,720
in providence i grew up like three

151
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,399
blocks off at third street in rhode

152
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,759
island so we're like rhode island

153
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,839
cannabis

154
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,240
i probably sold i sold it to brown

155
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,478
campus so it was like brown and risd and

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,038
i worked at a skate shop and i moved out

157
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:01,599
to california in 96

158
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,519
where you know i was you know buying

159
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,520
cannabis from arcata from up on the

160
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,839
square or boulder creek in santa cruz

161
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,599
and selling it on haight ashbury and um

162
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,679
you know i spent two years as a homeless

163
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,400
teenager on the hate and uh kind of

164
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,079
trying to go pro at this thing and um

165
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,079
and i you know so

166
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,478
have some history in it uh

167
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,758
i you know moved up to mendocino county

168
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:22,959
i

169
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,400
um

170
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,839
you know did what everyone else did we

171
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,679
hid behind our locked gates we were

172
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,279
trying to raise a family small farms

173
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,038
work on you know

174
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,119
local systems of governance you know

175
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,120
sharing community fire departments you

176
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,560
you name it and um got arrested and

177
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,639
ended up in cannabis policy and ended up

178
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,399
saying you know enough is enough

179
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,319
let's you know sherry glazer said get

180
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,359
out of the cannabis closet

181
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,439
so

182
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,280
came out and drew a map

183
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,680
and i drew an appellations map i took my

184
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:55,038
design talents and uh you know in my

185
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,280
knowing of regional you know specific

186
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,918
strains and heritage and i was you know

187
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,758
put it down on paper started i was going

188
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,799
up to wonderland nursery and asking kev

189
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,720
what do you think about this what do you

190
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,400
think about that and uh

191
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,319
all the breeders and you know all the

192
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,399
regions and you know we we put together

193
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,080
quite a project and

194
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,519
since then i've done things like the

195
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,359
emerald exchange trying to get small

196
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,758
batch cannabis farmers

197
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,199
access to market so started bringing

198
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,360
farmers out of the hills setting up

199
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
tables for them getting them in mason

200
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,800
jars you know helping them brand and

201
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,879
market themselves

202
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,079
fully illegally um you know so

203
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,918
everybody's like what are we what are we

204
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,719
doing this for and i'm like because this

205
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,000
is this shit's coming and um you know so

206
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,400
we've been working hard for the small

207
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,038
guys um you know for quite a few years

208
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,478
now and uh i'm really i'm just you know

209
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,000
it's an honor to you know stay here with

210
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,000
kev and um

211
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,519
mowgli i'm really interested to learn

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,879
more about what it is that you're doing

213
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,478
and how you can help solidify some of

214
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,160
the some of the metabolomic research and

215
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,918
data collection that we're doing to

216
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,879
internationally recognize appellations

217
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,799
of origin um and jeff you know i'm a i'm

218
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,400
a lover of roots man 10 years in

219
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,639
regenerative design theory and

220
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,959
permaculture practice and so you know

221
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,680
that's that that's that's my geek so

222
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,680
this is going to be fun

223
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,840
right on i think we're going to get into

224
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,399
uh we go right into the history of

225
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,679
genetics where where we began and so

226
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,799
that way we could start the process

227
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,720
because it really ties into all the

228
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
stuff we're doing where the varietals

229
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,160
that came into the united states

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,639
initially what people call land race i

231
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,439
don't use that verbiage because land

232
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,680
race to me is open pollination and not

233
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,598
selected and so when you start to select

234
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,439
cultivars that you're going to work with

235
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,718
you also choose males from those open

236
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,240
populations that you're going to use to

237
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,479
pollinate with and as soon as you put

238
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,240
your hand in the in the pile that's a

239
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,240
cultivated variety me it's no longer

240
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,639
land race land race is basically plants

241
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,158
that have developed for survival that's

242
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,600
all that's all they're for they don't

243
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,159
they don't care about yield they're not

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,639
worrying about quality of smoke it's a

245
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,519
genomic form that wants to live

246
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,439
and once humans started from these from

247
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,200
these genetic piles they pulled things

248
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,560
out that they liked they started to pull

249
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,480
things they liked for whatever reason

250
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,719
they chose and when you take a look at

251
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,800
the world in terms of latitude you can

252
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,040
see stuff that was equatorial was chosen

253
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,439
primarily for cerebral nature we can

254
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,120
make generalizations but the more we go

255
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,959
up in latitude the more we start to see

256
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,278
cbd genetics come out as you start to

257
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,799
look through these this material on lab

258
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,799
analysis you can start to see these

259
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,679
connections where the individuals that

260
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,599
lived in you know latitudes 20 to 40 had

261
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,079
a much harder life than those from zero

262
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,320
to 20 in terms of uh climactic

263
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,399
situations abundance of food and just in

264
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,000
general living conditions

265
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,480
and so so much of the cannabis that

266
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,399
comes into the u.s from when i was a kid

267
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
was coming in off of ships

268
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,000
on the east coast primarily and so it

269
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,360
was coming over from mexico into

270
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,559
california we used to call that stuff

271
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,560
scentsy that would have been like late

272
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,319
70s but so much of the weed coming into

273
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,239
new england was coming in through

274
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,320
fishing boats and so just like in

275
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
humboldt county when when cannabis uh

276
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,440
took off in humboldt it wasn't the

277
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,600
hippies that really blew it up it was

278
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,839
the loggers because the logging industry

279
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,480
disappears all of a sudden you have this

280
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,000
massive industrial workforce that has no

281
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,959
job and they say you know what we're

282
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,159
going to get into growing weed the

283
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,078
hippies are making money we might as

284
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,000
well make money too and so the next

285
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,759
thing you know humble county is punching

286
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,720
out as much canvas as one could grow but

287
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,480
it was not the hippies that were

288
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,639
punching it out it was the industrial

289
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,680
loggers new england was the same thing

290
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,600
the fishing industry collapses

291
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,439
collapse my whole neighborhood's a

292
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,159
fishing fishing area

293
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,600
and all of a sudden the uh the fishermen

294
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,600
are grabbing all the weed from the

295
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,600
offshore boat so the boats are coming in

296
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,959
out to sea the fish and boats would go

297
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,959
in grab the weed bring it into the

298
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,199
neighborhood my family wasn't into

299
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,958
cannabis but my my family was into

300
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,480
organized crime and because they were

301
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,759
into organized crime

302
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,000
uh they were they were kind of

303
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,159
terrifying people it allowed me to

304
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,919
access the cannabis industry in a

305
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,519
different way where i could kind of do

306
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,759
what i wanted and hang out with who i

307
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
chose because my family had such a

308
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,480
reputation

309
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
and so

310
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
it allowed me to get involved with some

311
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,759
stuff as a young guy that wasn't normal

312
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,360
so i got to see this incredible

313
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,399
diversity cannabis and it would come

314
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,000
through

315
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,480
seasonally we would see we would see

316
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,399
varietals coming in and the people that

317
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,240
were bringing in in bulk would tell you

318
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,559
hey we got colombian coming in and then

319
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,320
we knew tai would come in basically when

320
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,239
school started so the end of august 1st

321
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,920
of september you'd see tai coming in

322
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,720
you'd see afghani come in through the

323
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:20,559
season you'd see cannabis move globally

324
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,320
into the east coast you would see hash

325
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,559
move into the east coast but it was

326
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,800
always on a really consistent basis

327
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,278
but what we noticed was

328
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,679
that it wasn't homogenized that all of

329
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,480
these varietals were very distinct

330
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,479
and that's i think where we we went

331
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,200
wrong with what we did in genetics where

332
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,200
illegalities forced us to make changes

333
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,800
in terms of how we perceive cannabis and

334
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,879
because there was a shortage of cannabis

335
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,679
in general meaning that the the open

336
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,759
population couldn't access it freely

337
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,838
whatever you could buy you would buy

338
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,159
and what occurred was i i call it a

339
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,160
dumbing down of the population and we

340
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,480
started to really truncate what was

341
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,480
shortened what was available

342
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,360
and what we used

343
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,200
and and how we went about it and

344
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,120
that's where like right now it's

345
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,278
fascinating to have you know mowgli on

346
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
stage because what he's doing he's going

347
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,879
back in and taking a look at these

348
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,759
varieties on on a genetic level saying

349
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,600
hey in the genome itself what do we see

350
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,000
where do these things come from what

351
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,759
traits do they have how do we start to

352
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,879
pull the directions apart and start to

353
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,799
take this homogenized mix and start to

354
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,120
re-separate it out

355
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,799
because fundamentally all the cannabis

356
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,200
that came in from these overseas

357
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,879
situations was justin's working on

358
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,519
appalachians but appalachians are just

359
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,600
designations of production zones but all

360
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,679
cannabis came from designated production

361
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,920
zones that's what made it unique and

362
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:47,120
like jeff is is uh because i've read his

363
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:49,679
books and and i enjoy the shit of him um

364
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,759
but it it it's about how cannabis was

365
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,919
produced then organically and so the

366
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,519
relationship between cannabis in terms

367
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,199
of genomic

368
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,320
how it was produced where it was

369
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,959
produced

370
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,399
all contributes to what we have today

371
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,919
and i think so much of this this

372
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,839
direction that we're trying to go is to

373
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,799
figure out how do we go back into this

374
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,279
pile

375
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,319
separate the pile and figure out how do

376
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,039
we put

377
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,120
what belongs where where

378
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,159
and how do you drive the greatest input

379
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,519
out of it

380
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,439
and i think that when you get into

381
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,360
organic methodologies versus chemical

382
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,680
methodologies a lot of it is a

383
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,600
function of for one i don't want to call

384
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,399
it ethics but desire

385
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,278
and

386
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,958
also simplicity because chemical systems

387
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,480
are the favored because it allows you to

388
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,159
do a lot of automation

389
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,039
but and so i don't try to knock salt

390
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,078
guys

391
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:40,159
but it's not what creates these hyper

392
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,159
complex varietals the relationship

393
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,519
between what's in the soil the

394
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,439
microbiology

395
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,919
and the indigenous microbes from the

396
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,519
regions combined with the unique soil

397
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,519
profiles

398
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,480
all create that

399
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,159
and i think that for us so many of us as

400
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,159
we start to go forward as smaller

401
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,559
operators craft operators niche

402
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,719
operators appellation operators organic

403
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,799
operators genomic hunters

404
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,160
you're that's the direction we start to

405
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,479
go because otherwise what it is is it's

406
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,719
homogenized cannabis and as moog said

407
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,120
you're talking about uh operations in

408
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,959
canada that are doing heavily funded

409
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,720
huge operations for extraction put

410
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,159
anything together and the problem with

411
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,920
that is that none of us can compete with

412
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,759
that on economic level so it

413
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:26,958
fundamentally wipes us out as operators

414
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,600
and the direction is to is to is to

415
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,838
differentiate yourself from that package

416
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,759
but it's a process and it's it's a it's

417
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,120
a difficult process because it revolves

418
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,559
many of us to work together in a

419
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,159
collaborative fashion i think the

420
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,399
cannabis

421
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,559
didn't require that same collaboration

422
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,399
we were all in a collusion we would all

423
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,479
work together to make the money we would

424
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,320
all work together to keep our mouth shut

425
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,079
we were pretty good about it but we

426
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,680
didn't have to work together in the same

427
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,078
combined level because we made enough

428
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,439
money none of us really were broke if

429
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:56,958
you were in the weed game if you were

430
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,399
you weren't growing very well

431
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,078
and and that's true

432
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,679
you shouldn't have been broke

433
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,198
it doesn't mean that you were a king or

434
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,599
a queen it just meant that you had

435
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,439
adequate income and for the first time

436
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,240
the the money is what's drive in this

437
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,519
unity and as you start to have the unity

438
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,198
come together it starts to become

439
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,799
cultural spiritual where you start to

440
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,679
realize hey wait a second what we liked

441
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,958
was that that relationship that worked

442
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,719
and i think that that's what's taking

443
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,039
place now is as we start getting into

444
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,278
this this situation of

445
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,120
what it is that we're creating why are

446
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,838
we creating it and how do we utilize

447
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,639
this the skill sets and the tools

448
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,480
and

449
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,919
so we you know we go back into this time

450
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,000
period where all this beautiful canvas

451
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,360
came into the united states in the 70s

452
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,440
we would say well you know back to land

453
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,120
movement 68 but back to land movement

454
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,480
and humboldt was in 68 but there was

455
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,399
also these other

456
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,399
situations where they call it chautauqua

457
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,519
you know this this resurgence relove for

458
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,000
the land

459
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,879
spiritual awakening renaissance but you

460
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,440
see it all over the the new england area

461
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,439
you saw it in tennessee kentucky

462
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,079
you have it in pockets of the midwest

463
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,920
colorado idaho you have it on the whole

464
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,679
pacific northwest so it wasn't just

465
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,759
isolated to one region it was all over

466
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,120
the place and all of these places

467
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,879
received this incredible genomic

468
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,120
packages they got material from these

469
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,958
countries that was pretty true breeding

470
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,399
in the sense that you could basically

471
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,119
see what was going to come out of it you

472
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,278
would have mixed packages in terms of

473
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,519
resistance because that's really what

474
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,879
broad spectrum cannabis is

475
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,720
but you would have somewhat of a

476
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,159
consistency and people started to take

477
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,600
those varietals

478
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,120
and then they would start to mix them

479
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,879
with other things to work for their

480
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,639
situation so you started to see some of

481
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:34,639
the first really good crosses coming out

482
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,120
of that time and to me

483
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,959
that late 70s early 80s is really the

484
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,639
zenith of american cannabis where you

485
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,799
had people who were able to work it

486
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,799
fully heavily and they were using

487
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,479
organic biology and they were using

488
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,159
sun-grown methodologies and so what it

489
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,600
did is it allowed you to use basically

490
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,360
the material that was from these other

491
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,440
countries in the same form that it was

492
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,159
grown there so you weren't having to

493
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,839
make a radical change in how we fed or

494
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,600
how we selected it

495
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,279
and then you get into 83 which was

496
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,199
really the beginning of the drug war in

497
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,798
full form and i always tell people i

498
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,519
remember 83 because i got dragged out of

499
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,639
high school in handcuffs for cultivation

500
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,918
and

501
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,640
that

502
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,480
that was a turning point for most

503
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,160
individuals because at that time all of

504
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,318
a sudden the enforcement became heavy

505
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,240
cannabis was driven indoor and that's

506
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,318
when you started to see these changes in

507
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,400
what was required and what was needed

508
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:27,119
and you also started to see changes in

509
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,280
what individuals wanted to consume

510
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,439
because prior to that time period we

511
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,359
would call it cannabis more ethereal

512
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,360
meaning more more uplifting more

513
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,678
spiritual what individuals want to call

514
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:40,399
sativa even though it's all sativa but

515
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,880
um mental ethereal

516
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,880
uplifting strains

517
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,720
the the world started to change you

518
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,720
started to see a desire for different

519
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,079
cannabis and as the advent of indoor

520
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,759
cannabis came along you needed to have

521
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,399
things that flowered on a quicker time

522
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,759
frame you needed stuff that was stockier

523
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,280
people started choosing things that

524
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,558
worked in those capacities and you

525
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,038
started to see a lot of these old

526
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,798
varieties get trimmed away so the first

527
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,480
real culling of the population was in

528
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,200
that early 80s where a lot of the old

529
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,160
beautiful land race or derived from land

530
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,319
race

531
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,960
taken through cultivated variety brought

532
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,119
over to here held in form

533
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,720
pollinated worked outside

534
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,918
they all got called out because that

535
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,160
stuff didn't work on the indoor

536
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,520
methodology so all of a sudden boom we

537
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,600
get into indoor methodologies that's

538
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,759
when you started seeing uh the the

539
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:28,959
shorter broader leaves stockier more

540
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,440
narcotic cannabis become more in vogue

541
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,519
and it's just basically run that that

542
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,240
that direction ever since

543
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,918
and i think that you know what what i'm

544
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,160
involved with right now is trying to go

545
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,720
backwards in time and find things from

546
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,400
those golden eras of cannabis when the

547
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,160
varieties had

548
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:51,038
a more diverse effect and you had a much

549
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,919
different amount of things to play with

550
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,599
and

551
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,799
i think that for so many individuals

552
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,038
right now

553
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:58,000
they're so used to homogenized cannabis

554
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:59,519
where if you take a look at it

555
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,279
genomically you see that there's these

556
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,960
clusters but so much of the cannabis on

557
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,319
the shelf today is really related so

558
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,160
basically it's you know you have 40

559
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,960
cousins you're messing with so you might

560
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,798
as well be in kentucky

561
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,319
and and there's a problem with that is

562
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:13,839
that it really really doesn't allow

563
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,359
individuals to have the full range of

564
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,038
experience and what it does it doesn't

565
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,798
allow you as cultivators to have a

566
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,519
diversity in your own libraries and it

567
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:21,519
doesn't allow you to have

568
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,599
differentiation so when everybody's

569
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,200
growing the same og it doesn't make a

570
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,879
difference it's all og so you might have

571
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,400
the best og but it's still og where's

572
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,200
the differentiation

573
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,280
and

574
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,200
that on that point of it is

575
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,558
you know how do we utilize these tools

576
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,720
that we have forward where how do we

577
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,639
take knowledge on organic methodologies

578
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,558
which allow plants to express themselves

579
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,840
in a more balanced form how do you

580
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,839
utilize

581
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,319
the locations of appellations which

582
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,399
means specific production regions and

583
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,399
optimize that and then you know how do

584
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,240
you get into genomic mapping and where

585
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
where is the future of that and so i'll

586
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,079
throw it to mold for a second and say

587
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,159
hey um what was the what was the reason

588
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,000
why you started mapping cannabis and

589
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,279
what was it that you saw initially and

590
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,599
then where are we going within that

591
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:07,319
direction

592
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,319
thanks kev welcome

593
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,679
i mean so when we started mapping it

594
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,239
we were trying to tell this

595
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,240
this historical story that you

596
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,919
in a way just told

597
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,279
off the top of your head because you

598
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,799
knew it but we're trying to go back a

599
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,079
lot further too

600
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,079
so we wanted to know where all the

601
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,079
varieties came from i mean the story

602
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,079
begins

603
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,759
like it you know it doesn't begin when

604
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:35,199
stuff shows up here right like it begins

605
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:37,200
in like 10 000 years ago in central asia

606
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,798
and then the plant

607
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,159
followed humans everywhere around the

608
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,200
globe it literally went everywhere

609
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,480
and

610
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,519
and we're starting

611
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,798
we hope we're starting to be able to

612
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,960
piece together the story of how it

613
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:52,558
migrated you know we think it came over

614
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,240
to south america with the conquistadors

615
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,359
and you know somehow it came up to the

616
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,960
united states and there were all these

617
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,279
introductions from china and there's

618
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,600
this whole long history of it

619
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,798
but throughout that time

620
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,038
these

621
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,038
these individual varieties were

622
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,759
preserved and at that like we call those

623
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:14,240
land races because they

624
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,919
so i mean the way that

625
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,159
plant evolution happens once humans

626
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,159
starts to starts to mess with it right

627
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,919
it's like humans get their hands on it

628
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,320
and then they they're not breeding but

629
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,440
they do this they do seed saving right

630
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,720
so for millennia humans are saving seeds

631
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,519
and they're growing this diverse

632
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,519
population in this defined geographical

633
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,879
region and they're saving the seeds they

634
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,798
like

635
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,679
and and that exerts a little bit it's

636
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:39,519
not

637
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,000
it's not real breeding but it exerts

638
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,798
some selection pressure on it

639
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,960
and you end up with these

640
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,440
what they call land races that

641
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,400
you know in a certain valley

642
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,038
in

643
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,038
somewhere in afghanistan or thailand

644
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,879
for maybe millennia people have been

645
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,640
saving seeds and the plan has evolved

646
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,919
along with the humans

647
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,759
and it's

648
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,200
it's a bit different from the wild

649
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:07,200
variety

650
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,600
but it's also not a cultivated variety

651
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,080
and we don't know if people started

652
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,599
making crosses before that stuff started

653
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,359
getting imported

654
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,678
to the united states we just don't know

655
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,639
like it may be that in the 50s

656
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,400
um

657
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,159
in thailand they were making crosses and

658
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,519
it was really a cultivative right it was

659
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,799
just a land race and it was still

660
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,158
growing

661
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,400
semi-wild and they were just saving

662
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,120
seeds we just have no idea

663
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,120
can we find out

664
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,359
yeah we

665
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,199
we could find out if we got enough

666
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,158
samples from a region

667
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,080
um

668
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,840
we can do a thing called molecular clock

669
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,839
analysis and figure out how fast it was

670
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,240
evolving and see if there's a signature

671
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,839
of human selection pressure on it we

672
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,120
don't have enough samples from each area

673
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,959
yet to do that but we could we could

674
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,959
find out

675
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,720
but then the thing is like all that

676
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,279
stuff comes here just like you're saying

677
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,279
it comes here

678
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,400
and bam it's just all mixed together

679
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,158
and so

680
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,120
all those genes are still in the gene

681
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,320
pool

682
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,319
they're all out there they're all

683
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,319
circulating

684
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,679
and when we look genetically at the map

685
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,519
all the cannabis out there

686
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,519
it still seems incredibly diverse i mean

687
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,279
there's thousands and thousands and

688
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,038
thousands of kinds

689
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,359
but

690
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,640
there's a sameness to it because

691
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,279
like

692
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,640
like imagine you put like

693
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,759
a bunch of different things in a pot

694
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,520
right and they're all different and you

695
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,119
just stir it and stir it like all that

696
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,158
stuff is in there

697
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,399
but there is a kind of homogeneity to it

698
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,640
the great thing about genetics is that

699
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,640
um

700
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,839
some genes

701
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,720
when you mix them together

702
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:51,199
they blend right so like if a tall

703
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,079
person and a short person have a kid

704
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,919
that kid is often of intermediate height

705
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,359
those genes are there's a lot of genes

706
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,240
that go into height

707
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,839
and

708
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,599
together you end up with something in

709
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,599
the middle but then there are lots of

710
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,439
genes like blue eyes and brown eyes they

711
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,759
don't blend

712
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,919
they're just discreet characters so they

713
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,960
they stay they keep their force and you

714
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,640
can stir the pot as long as you want but

715
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,079
in every generation that gene is just

716
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,038
like boom

717
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,639
but it's randomly distributed now

718
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,240
and so in canvas we see the same thing

719
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,000
like there are certain features that i

720
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,480
think get blended

721
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,480
um but there are other features that uh

722
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:31,759
they just pop out like they're still

723
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,278
there so that

724
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,960
the stuff you know before the

725
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,960
introduction of all the afghani stuff

726
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,200
and correct me if i'm wrong but like the

727
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,678
reason why everything became so sedating

728
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,278
uh like that was not a consumer

729
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,960
consumer-driven trend right i mean those

730
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,798
plants we had people just had to grow

731
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,079
those plants and so suddenly consumers

732
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,319
are like oh i like this but that's what

733
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,359
there was kinda kinda because it was it

734
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,038
was so

735
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,119
powerful at the time it was such a

736
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,640
radically different experience to smoke

737
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,000
these nasty at the time the first

738
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,679
afghanis i remember messing with where

739
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,679
they called missouri's and they were the

740
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,600
dark golf balls with the red hair they

741
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,360
just make you sweat

742
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,879
and you weren't really used to like

743
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,959
something that shook the shit out of you

744
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,880
when you smoked it like you get lifted

745
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,720
and forget what your name was from from

746
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,039
ethereal cannabis and you'd be like wow

747
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,960
the colors of the sky are incredible but

748
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,400
when you were smoking really devastating

749
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,079
afghani man you wanted to go home and

750
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,600
lay down and go hide in the bed and

751
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,439
you'd wake up and your mom be wiping

752
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,119
your forehead with a rag saying are you

753
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,240
sick and you'd be like no i'm just

754
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:34,399
really fucking like yes

755
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,240
but you know it but it evolved into

756
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,320
where people wanted narcotics where i

757
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,558
got we we were talking one time about

758
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,678
maybe uh 11 12 years ago we talked about

759
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,158
trends

760
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,400
and someone said uh oh geez a fad and i

761
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,080
said no it's not and because i i look at

762
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,679
i look at trends and fads with cannabis

763
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,759
and that's and i said no it's not and i

764
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,200
but i didn't understand why so i did a

765
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,359
random sample of a thousand people

766
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,600
because i had a dispensary that um i was

767
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,959
able to use as my my test period so i

768
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,879
could ask questions and i started

769
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,360
logging the answers and the answers on a

770
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,200
lot of the heavy mercine-based uh

771
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,038
carafeline-based stuff was

772
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,200
heavy sedative because the tremendous

773
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:11,119
number of people had opiate issues

774
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,840
and so what we started to see over time

775
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:16,158
was opiate driven

776
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,879
replacement where if you were on opiates

777
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,679
you could utilize things that were

778
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,278
based in specific terpene categories as

779
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,600
a replacement but other varieties

780
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,440
wouldn't work as well so i think at

781
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,599
first when the when those afghanis came

782
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,720
out they worked well for indoor and they

783
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,879
worked well for a shorter cycle but i

784
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,120
think also it was such a radical change

785
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,559
in the type of high that you received

786
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:39,839
that i think that really turned people

787
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,918
on where they were like wow this is some

788
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,959
really really powerful stuff

789
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,120
yeah

790
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,360
yeah so it's a combination of all those

791
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,558
drivers but those other traits right

792
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,558
those traits that um

793
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,480
that

794
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,319
that originated with the plants that

795
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,079
people tend to call sativa even though

796
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,359
i'm not going to call it that

797
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,199
um

798
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,839
like those are in there right they're

799
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,000
still circulating in the population

800
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,079
some aspect as far as we can tell some

801
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,119
aspects of those traits are blended

802
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,720
right they've hit some kind of like

803
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,399
you know they're just being averaged out

804
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,679
with the afghani stuff which is too bad

805
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,919
but some of them

806
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,519
they just pop out sometimes right

807
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,440
there are varieties that just have those

808
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:22,798
aspects but they

809
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,558
i think they don't have all of them

810
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,639
right so so there's all these different

811
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,278
genes that need to be recombined to

812
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,120
recreate those varieties and we can do

813
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,720
that now we can go back we can turn the

814
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,239
clock backwards

815
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,319
if we're really paying attention to what

816
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,640
genes we want to put together it's just

817
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,918
really hard complicated work

818
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,679
and so right now we have this soup

819
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,399
but

820
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,559
small farmers in california and oregon

821
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,599
have to differentiate themselves

822
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,200
and

823
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,038
the way they're going to do it is

824
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,319
they're going to take that

825
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,519
they're going to start to take that soup

826
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,678
apart

827
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,720
and they're really going to start to

828
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:01,440
re-differentiate the plant they're going

829
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,759
to start using real breeding to really

830
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,159
drive towards very specific things you

831
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,759
know right now breeders drive towards a

832
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,240
flavor

833
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,640
you know that that's that's a

834
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,558
overarching goal you know and they'll

835
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,200
get certain effects and

836
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:20,319
but they're still just stirring the pot

837
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,000
once people start to identify real goals

838
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,759
and they can really differentiate

839
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,960
cannabis into

840
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,960
back towards

841
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,919
specific kinds that we originally had or

842
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,519
towards towards kinds that are new new

843
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,600
combinations where you're really

844
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,158
combining a whole handful of traits to

845
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,079
make a plant that is outrageous in some

846
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,559
way and that if you mixed it into the

847
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,720
whole pool like it would all go away

848
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,519
that's the differentiation that's going

849
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,679
to make local growers in different

850
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,599
appalachians start to stand out and

851
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,798
people in different regions

852
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,359
they're going to focus on different

853
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:56,079
things like that and we can get there

854
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,678
where it's like wow in southern mendo

855
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,439
you know they're making plants that are

856
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,038
you know that remind us of what panama

857
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,519
red used to be like

858
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,879
and but it's going to take a lot of work

859
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,119
it's not this the way we've been

860
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,360
breeding now

861
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,959
it's not going to get us there

862
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,119
i don't think

863
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,880
no i don't think so either i think

864
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,239
i think too that like with what justin's

865
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,240
doing with the appalachian and i'm gonna

866
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,798
let justin and jeff kind of chew this

867
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,519
one up a little bit because really

868
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:26,319
the impact on the overall is based off

869
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,319
of the plant and its inputs and so much

870
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,398
is the direction of where it's located

871
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,839
and then what what's what's feeding it

872
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,839
what's driving it

873
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,599
and you're seeing this huge uh i say a

874
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,599
renaissance in organics i think cannabis

875
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,558
drove the renaissance and organics i

876
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,798
think that

877
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:42,319
for most individuals

878
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:43,599
they started to become very aware that

879
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,599
they were feeding their plants better

880
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,918
than they were feeding themselves

881
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,000
and because they had the disposal income

882
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,520
they could actually start to

883
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,880
create a market at stores where they

884
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,398
would say hey i want to go buy these

885
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,760
products and stores started to cater to

886
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:57,119
them and if you go to places like where

887
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,798
i'm from and humble there's a lot of

888
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,079
organic shops

889
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,000
and so you know and it's

890
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:04,480
disproportionate for the population how

891
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,919
much organic selection that you have

892
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,599
but i think so much of it wasn't that

893
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,440
the people were so aware it was they

894
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,759
became aware from the fact that they

895
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,360
were taking better care of their plants

896
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,879
it started to make them realize that the

897
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,038
products that they were purchasing were

898
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,559
of lower quality from supermarkets and

899
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:20,480
all of a sudden there was a demand to

900
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:21,599
feed this opportunity

901
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,960
and

902
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,759
you're starting to see this uh

903
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,440
incredible desire to hunt out microbes

904
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,278
um the the in

905
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,120
indigenous microorganisms where people

906
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,679
are starting to do their own mining and

907
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,000
i got involved in that maybe i say i'd

908
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,640
say 10 12 years ago where i saw these

909
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,200
filipino guys that had been culturing

910
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,799
stuff for like 100 years like sourdough

911
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,679
and they were passing it on and so i

912
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,918
started to mine my own microbes

913
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,440
and then tried to do the same thing but

914
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,840
it was i didn't have the skills to hold

915
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,240
it in that form i i'm i was learning and

916
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,839
then with fermentations and and how that

917
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,679
applies

918
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,319
to your appellations because these

919
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,559
appellations have a unique

920
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:05,038
input the terroir like french have you

921
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,440
seen french cannoli frenchies he almost

922
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,398
spits the word out

923
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,320
and

924
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,398
but the point is that i'm gonna let if a

925
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,960
possible let jeff and justin kind of get

926
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,119
into what is an appellation

927
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,038
and and from his definition of it

928
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,319
because it applies to us in cannabis and

929
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,720
it's been used in so many different

930
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:25,599
words and then and hopefully then then

931
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,278
uh jeff can kick in about you know what

932
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,519
what these inputs are and how they

933
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,679
affect because overall all of that

934
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,960
applies ultimately to the end quality of

935
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,880
the product

936
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,159
and for me more than just the end

937
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,399
quality the product also the

938
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,320
sustainability of the whole model

939
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,479
because to me i think that like i said i

940
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,599
try not to go off on salt driven systems

941
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,519
but

942
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,439
it's to me it's not sustainable because

943
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,278
you're you're you're creating too much

944
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,480
waste you're creating waste in the

945
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,720
creation of it and you're and you're

946
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,839
doing damage on the usage of it

947
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,278
and so

948
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:56,798
i'll turn it over

949
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,319
that's a lot

950
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:59,038
i wish i had a pen and paper because i

951
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:02,398
had

952
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:04,480
something on all of it um

953
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,079
one thing is for a shout out to frenchie

954
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,038
is uh

955
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:11,038
all of this is about proving tawa right

956
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,839
so it's like we have

957
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,119
a 20 50 100 year project ahead of us

958
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:17,119
this what we're talking about is

959
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,479
hypothetical and theoretical and and

960
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,398
everything that we're doing is

961
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,480
community-driven research

962
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,239
you know all of us together putting our

963
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,240
putting our knowledge in the pot and

964
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,519
coming up with what the best system is i

965
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,079
think that uh

966
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,399
prohibition didn't do us a service

967
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,678
um with plant cows i think that's

968
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:35,518
something we're getting into right now

969
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,600
with the appalachians you know project

970
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,599
is you know we're talking to a lot of

971
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:41,119
cultivators up in like palo verde and

972
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:42,879
places like that

973
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,879
and we're talking about you know

974
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,200
you know standard set to indigenize

975
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,240
inoculants engineer all soil on site and

976
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
you know and then we're getting farmers

977
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,000
saying well you know what about our

978
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,199
yields you know we can't go in ground

979
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
you know there's no way we're gonna

980
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,558
smart pots raised beds engineered soils

981
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,159
you know this is part of our new culture

982
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,798
and really that's part of a prohibition

983
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,039
culture that was when we had to maximize

984
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:07,278
the amount of of yield we were getting

985
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,798
off of a per plant basis because the

986
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,880
federal government was saying you know

987
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,759
99 plus plants

988
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,919
you know above 99 or 100 and above is a

989
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,720
federal crime so it was like so everyone

990
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,080
was like oh yeah 99 and below we'll you

991
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,880
know we'll we'll

992
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:24,720
you know state kind of frowns upon us

993
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,640
but uh so you know so if you realize how

994
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,798
do we get the biggest

995
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,600
freaking plant and how do we do that we

996
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,558
we put 800 gallons of soil we engineer

997
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,240
it all we pump it full of juice gas

998
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:37,519
whatever we're you know and then we get

999
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,720
a you know

1000
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,440
a five a ten a fifteen someone in

1001
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,880
southern oregon had a 22 pound plant you

1002
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,038
know uh

1003
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,640
do i what variety i think was a cookie

1004
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:50,079
but it was on that it was on a magazine

1005
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,159
it was in a big magazine it was like the

1006
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:55,119
22 pounder and i was like i was like

1007
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,120
that's got to be crap

1008
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,360
but you know and so we were having this

1009
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,558
conversation the other day on a on a sub

1010
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,959
actually i think it was this morning on

1011
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,639
a subcommittee call for appellations and

1012
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,720
um we were talking about you know in the

1013
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,320
fields of afghanistan where you know in

1014
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,878
some of these cannabis heritage regions

1015
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,599
where you see these you know um you know

1016
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:16,960
valleys full of dry farmed in

1017
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,760
afghanistan farmed waist-high cannabis

1018
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,358
right that is it looks the opposite

1019
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,879
there's always like afghani kisses the

1020
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:26,559
opposite of these you know 10 12-pound

1021
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:27,838
monsters you see in the magazines now

1022
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,918
with all of us growers sitting there

1023
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,480
with our like you know shirts saying yo

1024
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,319
we did this and it's like but what are

1025
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,199
you really doing right you know what are

1026
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,480
you doing to the plant what are you

1027
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,000
doing the genotype what are you doing

1028
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,280
you know what is that phenotype you're

1029
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,918
we're hunting something that's going to

1030
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,480
get bigger higher yield but our quality

1031
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,398
markers aren't set properly so we talk

1032
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,679
about money now as it's getting on the

1033
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:49,759
money thing we're all like unifying

1034
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,918
around money and the fact of the matter

1035
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,200
is is it's like now

1036
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,799
we're going to be getting into this

1037
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,158
place where genetics are going to be

1038
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,640
bred where you're going to have this

1039
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,320
like homogenized crop going out into the

1040
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:04,879
open to grow 500 acres of cannabis and

1041
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,400
it's our responsibility now to say how

1042
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,640
is that cannabis grown where was it

1043
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,240
grown in soil what was the marine layer

1044
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,639
condition was the altitude what was it

1045
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,559
you know what what did we do to not only

1046
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:18,239
indigenize the inoculants but to

1047
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:20,000
actually co-evolve that cultivar to the

1048
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,719
soil and to the to the climactic

1049
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,719
conditions over decades and how is it

1050
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:27,199
going to express itself fully in that

1051
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:29,439
region so we're looking at you know now

1052
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,960
profile testing terpenes you know

1053
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,559
terpene profiles like what's gonna

1054
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,720
what's now everybody's talking about

1055
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,400
like you know what's a terp count

1056
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,000
you know so it's like the cannabinoids

1057
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,079
are you know every day there's another

1058
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,679
cannabinoid you know a compound that's

1059
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,760
coming out in in reaction to another

1060
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:46,159
terpene and now everyone's seeking that

1061
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,640
medicine right well that medicine is

1062
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,519
actually regionally specific

1063
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:54,078
right the different heritage strains you

1064
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,159
know we call heritage let's say 50 years

1065
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,920
selected to breed that quality that

1066
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,078
trichome development so it's like

1067
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,920
appalachian's development right now is

1068
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,839
going to be talking about quality

1069
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,280
medicine development you know and we're

1070
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,599
going to be seeking strains and we're

1071
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,200
going to be seeking cultivars from these

1072
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,599
regions because they were able to

1073
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:14,319
express themselves fully in that region

1074
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,519
and have full profile developments and

1075
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,039
that's done i do believe in the mineral

1076
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,480
content of the soil

1077
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:24,159
with that with that marine layer

1078
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,159
condition with with that altitude

1079
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,799
and we see it i mean it's you know in

1080
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:31,358
spy rock um i watched some of the the

1081
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,519
world's best sour diesel being grown i

1082
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,440
would never for the love of me grow that

1083
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,759
sour diesel in navarro

1084
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,119
like it it's like shitty and it's i

1085
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,720
watch my friends and neighbors do it

1086
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,559
every year and throw away half their

1087
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,078
crop because it's market driven they

1088
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:47,039
want something that's like high potency

1089
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,079
they want something so we need to like

1090
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,838
you know we need to start having this

1091
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,320
qual you know this conversation about

1092
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:53,759
quality and these quality markers and i

1093
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,240
think that what you're doing mowgli is

1094
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,040
really important because that you know

1095
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,799
that cellular capture that data capture

1096
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:03,279
you know to tell us like okay that's a

1097
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,200
marker that's what that plan expressed

1098
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,599
itself in that way that's the genotype

1099
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,799
that we're seeking for that region and

1100
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,880
then we need to

1101
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,359
we need to match that with the region

1102
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,039
and use that as i p protections and go

1103
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,400
ahead and claim it so that's that's

1104
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,119
that's kind of where we're going in the

1105
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,119
appellation space with that but i think

1106
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,079
the conversation needs to be about

1107
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,000
unifying around markers of quality like

1108
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,280
you know indoor

1109
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,159
mixed light

1110
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,920
appellation you know terpene

1111
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,559
cannabinoid like what are what are you

1112
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,159
know what are we looking for to come out

1113
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,239
of the strain so that the consumer

1114
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:39,838
market can start to differentiate

1115
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:42,399
you know the the actual product that

1116
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:45,199
we're consuming

1117
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,720
well a couple of things first

1118
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,399
it seems to me that we we need to

1119
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,480
recognize what

1120
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,559
why we're here and why we're really

1121
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,719
talking about this stuff and i think if

1122
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,078
i say coca-cola pepsi cola scott's

1123
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,000
miracle grow

1124
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:01,119
you know you get the idea what's going

1125
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,559
to happen is this canadian situation

1126
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,720
you're going to have a big company a

1127
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,719
pepsi cola coca-cola they're going to

1128
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,239
want one kind of cannabis because that's

1129
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,159
what they want in their standardized

1130
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:11,519
drink maybe they'll have three different

1131
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,239
drinks but they won't have very many

1132
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,119
more than that and and

1133
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,959
you know if we're not careful

1134
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,559
then we're going to be forced to grow

1135
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,599
for them

1136
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:26,159
what we want to do is grow for

1137
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,480
individuals we want to stay in business

1138
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,239
without having to merge with a gigantic

1139
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,920
company we don't necessarily want to

1140
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,039
merge with each other we want to

1141
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,599
continue to do our thing individually

1142
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:40,079
and and share our information and make

1143
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:44,160
sure that we're not cut out of this

1144
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,720
business by the industry that is clearly

1145
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,920
forming no question about it

1146
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:49,838
number two

1147
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,400
we want to make sure that we don't

1148
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,599
continue to allow the government to fuck

1149
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,440
us over

1150
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,440
as we do this and i mean this in a

1151
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,320
couple of different ways

1152
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,760
why

1153
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,119
we allow

1154
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,200
in alaska

1155
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,119
you know they they say you don't have to

1156
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,439
test your stuff for pesticides that's

1157
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,960
bullshit of course you should

1158
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,720
we're selling a product that people are

1159
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,199
ingesting

1160
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:15,519
you know whether you're organic or not

1161
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:18,399
people need to know what's on their

1162
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,800
product you know and so we got to make

1163
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,358
sure that the government does what we

1164
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,599
want them to do not what these new

1165
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,159
regulators want to do so that they can

1166
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,320
keep their jobs and those two things i

1167
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,319
think are the backdrop

1168
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,680
that you've got to keep in mind when you

1169
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,960
ask the question which i think we're all

1170
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:37,039
trying to ask

1171
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,320
which is i put it in this way

1172
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:42,239
can you grow

1173
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,079
durbin poison in anchorage alaska

1174
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:47,598
i want to grow durbin poison in

1175
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,599
anchorage alaska can i really do it and

1176
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,559
to me based upon the books that i've

1177
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,559
written

1178
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,559
and the stuff that i've you know read

1179
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:57,759
from your company and others there are

1180
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,000
three stool three legs to the stool

1181
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,320
the first is genetics and if you don't

1182
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,159
have the durban poison genetics you're

1183
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,599
not going to have durbin poison so we

1184
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,559
have to figure out what the durbin

1185
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,960
poison genetics really are the second

1186
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:13,279
are is the soil you know that's that's

1187
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,039
in theory my expertise there is no

1188
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,760
question that the soil has a direct

1189
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:19,440
impact on all of the things that go on

1190
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,280
inside the plant for the various reasons

1191
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,358
that are in all three of my books but

1192
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,160
not the least of which is that you've

1193
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:29,920
got bacteria and fungi that are

1194
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:32,838
responsible for feeding the plant now

1195
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:36,159
they in turn are impacted by

1196
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:38,960
microarthropods nematodes and protozoa

1197
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:42,559
but all of those things together are

1198
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,880
what help make up your appellation um

1199
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,358
and and if you if you've got the durbin

1200
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,760
poison genes then what you want to try

1201
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:52,078
to do is make sure that you've got soil

1202
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,319
that mimics the durbin

1203
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,359
soil so you need to figure out and i'm

1204
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,679
sure we're going to end up in a

1205
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,920
situation where in addition to doing you

1206
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,838
know the the genotypes and figuring out

1207
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,920
i mean you know figuring out what what

1208
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:05,599
what the dna is we're going to have

1209
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,358
books that are going to be able to say

1210
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,359
and this is what the soil is like this

1211
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:11,519
is what the microbiology is like this is

1212
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,838
what the this is what the uh you know

1213
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:16,000
the the biomass of the soil is like in

1214
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,358
that area if you talk to dr elaine

1215
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,599
ingham she will tell you you need

1216
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:21,759
slightly more fungal than bacterial she

1217
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,599
will tell you you know that you need

1218
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,520
certain kinds of protozoa over other

1219
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,079
protozoa and all of this stuff is

1220
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,440
important and we're not getting it

1221
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,800
you should be getting it and i think

1222
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,800
you're beginning to pick up a little bit

1223
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,720
of it but we need to make sure that

1224
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,480
we're all sharing this information and

1225
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,799
figuring out what it really is we don't

1226
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,318
know yet and then the third leg from my

1227
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,680
perspective

1228
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:46,318
is light sunlight and and uh

1229
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,159
sin are you here yeah okay uh if we can

1230
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:49,358
just for two seconds maybe while sin

1231
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,239
sets this up

1232
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,239
so you if you don't have the sunlight

1233
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,318
from south africa

1234
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,559
you can't really grow the durban poison

1235
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:00,239
now we concentrate on soil because

1236
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,400
that's what the grape growers do you

1237
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:03,759
know but in cannabis

1238
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,119
it's the light

1239
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,079
that as much as anything that causes the

1240
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,599
soil microbes act the way they act and

1241
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,160
of course the plant to act the way it

1242
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,640
acts so so we've got a situation where

1243
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,879
we used to grow outdoors and we had

1244
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,799
sunlight and then the prohibition came

1245
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,079
and they pushed us indoors and so we've

1246
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,720
got a lot of people are still going

1247
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,560
indoors and the industry

1248
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:28,879
seems to be

1249
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:33,279
coming to the conclusion you know that

1250
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,119
that if they grow indoors using sunlight

1251
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,240
as well that they're gonna you know

1252
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,880
they're gonna be

1253
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:41,679
benefit i don't know where the little

1254
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,680
grower fits in in that scenario but

1255
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:46,480
we've got to learn

1256
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:50,159
the differences between the lights that

1257
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,838
scott's miracle grower wants you to buy

1258
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:52,879
you know because they bought the company

1259
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,078
and okay they're going to push it

1260
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,838
they're going to advertise it they don't

1261
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,039
give a shit if it doesn't do

1262
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:58,639
a couple of the things that you really

1263
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:01,440
needed to do because they bought the

1264
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:04,000
company and they need to be making money

1265
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,679
or we can we can develop our own product

1266
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,599
projects which is what this fellow over

1267
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,159
here has done now you may never have

1268
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,599
heard of a plasma light but what sin is

1269
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,199
about to show you

1270
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,680
is the sun

1271
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,679
in a little teeny light that he can pick

1272
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:20,159
up with one hand

1273
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,679
and he can change the gas that's inside

1274
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,078
this lamp

1275
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:26,559
and he can change that gas in many

1276
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,119
different ways to create

1277
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,719
the sun that you want so we went to nasa

1278
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,599
to talk to them about the potential of

1279
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:36,239
growing food using this light so if you

1280
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,720
want to grow south african cannabis in

1281
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,799
anchorage alaska you set the light to

1282
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:42,719
the wavelengths which are all available

1283
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,880
by the way

1284
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,679
so that you can duplicate the same kind

1285
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,960
of light that's in south africa that's

1286
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,118
pretty amazing

1287
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,079
now none of this stuff makes any sense

1288
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,318
unless you know what the genetics are

1289
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,000
and and so it always starts with the

1290
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,559
genetics which is why you know the

1291
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,039
phylos bioscience project is really so

1292
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:06,000
key but i think you would agree that the

1293
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,838
genetics are influenced

1294
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,880
by

1295
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:14,000
sunlight yeah mental conditions matter

1296
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,400
but epigenetics matter like just as much

1297
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,318
and maybe even more do they do i mean i

1298
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,079
know they matter but do they matter as

1299
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,400
much or more

1300
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,240
where basically the expression is latent

1301
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,079
in all of these watered-down strains

1302
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,598
that we have and that we see but when

1303
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,680
you give them the right environmental

1304
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,359
conditions for them to express the best

1305
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,759
version of those cells you see a

1306
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:36,078
different version of that genetic

1307
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,040
the period and the story whether it's

1308
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,480
you know

1309
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:41,119
the same

1310
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,079
check check the same moms

1311
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:47,039
right the same cuts from the same moms

1312
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,200
you take them nationwide right

1313
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,440
the the uh

1314
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,199
expression of those is going to be based

1315
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,760
on their environment not just the

1316
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,039
energetics or the genetics that's right

1317
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,880
but the question is

1318
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:59,759
the question is the same and i agree

1319
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,920
with you i think you're absolutely

1320
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,119
correct but but if you are able to

1321
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,280
control with better precision

1322
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,280
the other the other

1323
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,200
actions

1324
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,599
then you then you have less of an

1325
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,679
influence by the epigenetic stuff which

1326
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,680
is not necessarily bad by the way but

1327
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,679
jeff

1328
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,960
i agree i understand yeah so let me ask

1329
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,960
you a question

1330
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,280
say you go down to

1331
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:33,598
to humble you get a lot of soil from one

1332
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:37,280
of the valleys there

1333
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,280
and you bring it up to alaska right

1334
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,800
and you and you plant

1335
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:45,118
you plant an og

1336
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,119
in it

1337
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,440
and then you turn on the plasma light

1338
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:51,519
and you dial it in so that it has the

1339
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,559
same light at the latitude and longitude

1340
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:54,559
where you took that soil

1341
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,079
should that plant then be eligible for

1342
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,599
the humbled appellation

1343
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,680
that's that's the question i was going

1344
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,800
to ask because i think it's a very good

1345
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,639
question

1346
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,359
no well i mean i said

1347
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,199
no

1348
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:11,199
no and and i and i think that's an

1349
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,199
interesting question because it because

1350
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,439
it's it's it's millions of years of

1351
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,519
co-evolution of that soil's relationship

1352
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,440
to the entire environment not just the

1353
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,960
sun but you haven't but you haven't been

1354
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,440
growing the cannabis for millions of

1355
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,920
years here's the deal it's not about the

1356
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,920
cannabis it's about protecting the earth

1357
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,720
right we're also this ip protects the

1358
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,400
earth in which we stand right this isn't

1359
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,959
just about we are using cannabis

1360
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,079
genetics to find out this metabolomic

1361
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:40,159
capture but once we capture and and use

1362
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,720
a sensational nature that we have this

1363
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:45,279
stage that we have right now we can

1364
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:48,078
protect genetics worldwide but not just

1365
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,400
the genetics the humans that live in

1366
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,318
co-crea and co-evolution with those

1367
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,200
genetics indigenous tribes all over the

1368
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:57,599
world need these protections as well do

1369
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,919
their cultivars and so if we start

1370
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,920
manipulating that and start shifting

1371
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,318
that and then it's not just shifting the

1372
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,240
genetics it's shifting the policies that

1373
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:07,920
those genetics protect and we start

1374
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:12,399
shifting the politics policies that

1375
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:14,639
protect the people i mean capitalism won

1376
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,838
i would i would agree that

1377
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:16,799
way before you answered let me just

1378
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:17,759
answer your question in a slightly

1379
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,800
different way

1380
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,359
if you take alaskan soil because that's

1381
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,039
as i've done if you take alaskan soil

1382
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,199
down to a hawaii

1383
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,880
you can grow a giant cabbage

1384
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:32,399
the giant cabbages that we grow in

1385
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:35,200
alaska is soil based i live in anchorage

1386
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,160
you can't grow those giant cabbages in

1387
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:37,598
anchorage

1388
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,679
wasilla

1389
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,920
where they grow them palmer

1390
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:44,318
is 40 minutes away

1391
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,119
the difference is the soil if you bring

1392
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:49,759
that soil from wasilla into anchorage

1393
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:51,599
you can grow the giant cabbage

1394
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,720
but you can't grow the giant cabbage

1395
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,318
without that soil so in a way

1396
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,239
it's the same genetics the same

1397
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:01,039
conditions it's not the same expression

1398
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:03,039
that's why we need that capture

1399
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,519
that's why we need that capture i was

1400
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,920
involved in led development probably a

1401
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:09,280
decade ago with a company where helio

1402
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,960
spectre came in and said we want to do

1403
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,040
led development and at that time none of

1404
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,358
the europeans could touch cannabis so

1405
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:17,039
they used my facility to do all the r d

1406
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:18,639
and then they would ship all these light

1407
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:20,719
scientists in from all over the world to

1408
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:22,879
do the tests and i would run

1409
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:24,719
uh standardized testing where we would

1410
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,160
hold one under what we knew so i knew

1411
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,239
the cultivar i would put it under the

1412
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,598
traditional hbs we would then run the

1413
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,279
heliospectres and we couldn't get the

1414
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,039
stuff to shine the way we wanted to

1415
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,559
until i took them up the hill and we

1416
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,599
started to measure the sun coming off of

1417
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,040
my farm

1418
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,160
and that started to let him get a better

1419
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,519
baseline

1420
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:43,679
of what was desired for that situation

1421
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,239
but from what you're saying is yeah the

1422
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:48,960
soil microbes from that and and and if

1423
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,479
we move it does it does it create an uh

1424
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,400
a sameness

1425
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,480
but i think that justin's right in terms

1426
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,800
of the overall picture is too big to

1427
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,119
capture so you can't capture an

1428
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,960
appellation by just microbials or just

1429
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,559
sunlight because it has to be the entire

1430
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,440
environment and even though we don't

1431
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,200
have

1432
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,920
cannabis appellation so to speak because

1433
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:09,838
none of us have 60 years minimum of of

1434
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,000
genetic manipulation where we've got

1435
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:13,679
genomic forms that have been developed

1436
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,039
for at least 60-year period which is

1437
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,679
typically like a standard in

1438
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,838
appalachians we don't have that

1439
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:21,440
but the point is that

1440
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:23,279
we always had that theory of if you

1441
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,639
wanted to grow good colombian because i

1442
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,079
knew that the hawaiian the same thing

1443
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:27,519
was when i was in hawaii and i was

1444
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,519
consuming some of this kill of high

1445
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,759
mountain hawaiian which is really

1446
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,759
southeast asian varietals

1447
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,680
it was so nasty

1448
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,359
but when we grew it in humboldt even if

1449
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:39,199
we had the ability to protect it for the

1450
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:41,119
longer season it didn't have the same

1451
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,799
flavonoid profiles and the high was

1452
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,880
different and so we knew that it was

1453
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,039
soil biology that was driving it but we

1454
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,480
didn't have the ability to replicate it

1455
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,119
we weren't we weren't knowledgeable

1456
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,960
enough at the time you lost it yeah no

1457
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,280
you're right and and

1458
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,358
all of these things make a difference

1459
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,880
but the question the question is i live

1460
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,480
in anchorage alaska

1461
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,720
and i'm going to go down you know right

1462
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,920
now i can't go down to california to buy

1463
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:05,598
my

1464
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,480
durvan poison from

1465
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,280
you

1466
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,800
so i got to grow in anchorage alaska now

1467
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,040
if we end up with the wrong kind of

1468
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,119
regulatory system i.e they're going to

1469
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:16,480
let states make a determination in some

1470
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,000
states you'll be able to do it and some

1471
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,480
you won't

1472
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,559
so that that that presents the sort of

1473
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,358
the problem that a wine industry doesn't

1474
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,280
have

1475
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:26,558
you know you can ship anywhere but is it

1476
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,240
responsible

1477
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,839
now that's a whole other question that's

1478
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:32,479
that's that's the question we have to

1479
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:34,960
ask as consumers as you know it's like

1480
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,519
is it responsible to put that love that

1481
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,358
that that weight on the earth because we

1482
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,838
want something

1483
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:44,480
is it are you saying it is and if we

1484
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:47,599
need something is it better for us to go

1485
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:51,039
where that something is already

1486
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:53,519
for appellations in in in norcal you're

1487
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:56,239
going to see the incredibly diminished

1488
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:59,199
amounts of cannabis that can be grown

1489
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,318
based off of watershed availability so

1490
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,679
they're going to they've already

1491
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:02,960
controlled the water flow pretty good

1492
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:04,558
but over the next couple years they're

1493
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,318
going to go out all these watersheds

1494
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,599
heavily and start to determine and it's

1495
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:09,440
kind of arbitrary because no one really

1496
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,200
knows consumptive how much waters are

1497
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,880
actually in the ground to suck up

1498
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:14,799
but they're going to start to change how

1499
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,039
much you can actually cultivate in your

1500
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,160
watershed so how much cannabis can be

1501
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,159
created

1502
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,920
which is terrifying for a lot of the

1503
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,318
smaller people but they don't understand

1504
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,400
that scarcity creates value just like

1505
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:28,558
scarcity creates a value of an antiquity

1506
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,880
sand is pretty old but it's not valuable

1507
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,960
um you get something that has a scarcity

1508
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,200
there's a value and i think that as we

1509
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,559
go forward

1510
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,000
yeah you can ship it as you go forward

1511
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,280
but first even within these limited

1512
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,119
markets

1513
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,839
for the individuals that are able to

1514
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,160
produce certain batch lots that are less

1515
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:47,679
it'll be clearly defined from i mean i'm

1516
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:49,598
looking at operations right now that are

1517
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:50,399
talking about doing 200 000 pounds a

1518
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,680
year

1519
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,200
so i mean i'm talking i'm talking to

1520
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,480
guys that are putting in that opposite

1521
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,239
that are looking at you know that's

1522
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,639
that's that's that's a credible amount

1523
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:00,799
200 000 pounds off off of a single

1524
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:02,719
operation is frightening

1525
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,480
so you you and it doesn't sound like

1526
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:06,399
scarcity no

1527
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,159
and and so the thing is that with the

1528
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,920
appalachian situations that he's talking

1529
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:11,838
about it's not just geographical zones

1530
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,680
but it will be it'll be compressed

1531
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:15,599
because the state is going to compress

1532
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:18,239
it through water usage

1533
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,880
and so you're going to see

1534
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,959
a lot less produced in general and in

1535
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,720
these specific regions once we are able

1536
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,880
to use genomics and understand

1537
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,118
microbiology to a degree that lets us

1538
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,000
tailor what we're really trying to do

1539
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,680
i think then you'll have a

1540
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,519
differentiation you don't really have it

1541
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:34,879
now i think right now what you have is a

1542
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:37,039
basket of cannabis everybody's just

1543
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,720
grabbing it you don't really have this

1544
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,079
upper shelf in this lower shelf it's all

1545
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:41,838
kind of this what it is if everybody's

1546
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,119
growing the same weed all over the state

1547
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:44,799
and we're all saying we're doing some

1548
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,318
unbelievable job with it

1549
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,519
how can you really compare that you

1550
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:49,759
can't

1551
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:52,079
it has to be these unique forms

1552
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,359
and so you know this this this situation

1553
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,039
and look at this i'm sure there's people

1554
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,239
here that are doing large operations and

1555
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,318
it's not meant to exclude them at all

1556
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:00,078
because those larger operations they'll

1557
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,239
use the same information because they're

1558
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,359
going to use microbiology to increase

1559
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:06,078
resistance and they're going to use

1560
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:08,078
genetic modeling sifting marking and

1561
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,720
selection to be able to improve what

1562
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,160
they do and then the appalachian regions

1563
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:13,519
are where they produce these things if

1564
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,598
they're within those regions and they

1565
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,280
follow suit or they have an investment

1566
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,838
in one of these it'll it'll diversify

1567
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,599
their portfolio so no matter what size

1568
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:24,078
you are the conversation still really

1569
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,838
applies i think it's hilarious that in

1570
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,280
humboldt county they're talking about

1571
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:28,799
water rationing

1572
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,040
and in in

1573
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,519
in siskiyou county they're building

1574
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:36,000
tunnels to ship water to the desert and

1575
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,920
they're stealing water so it's like

1576
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,239
so if you want to grow a bunch of

1577
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,358
cannabis move to the desert i mean that

1578
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:45,439
city like makes absolutely no sense

1579
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:47,679
but humboldt county though your water

1580
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,920
guys are going around to farms and to

1581
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:52,480
producer to to large-scale industrial

1582
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,000
facilities uh soil guys and getting them

1583
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,838
to double their water count so they can

1584
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,838
keep the water in humble because there's

1585
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:59,519
people already shopping for your water

1586
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:01,279
to ship it out well we gotta we got a

1587
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,358
water mill i mean this this isn't about

1588
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,960
cannabis but it kind is is that there's

1589
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,759
a there's a lake called ruth lake and it

1590
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,519
was it was designed to feed a mill so

1591
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,920
this giant mill facility asked me if i

1592
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,759
wanted to put a major nursery operation

1593
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,440
in but when i toured the whole facility

1594
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,359
it was a super fun site

1595
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,960
and i just knew i said there's no way

1596
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:21,598
you can get this thing clean enough to

1597
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,760
really do any work and it's just not the

1598
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,119
right location for agriculture

1599
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,280
but the thing that made it attractive

1600
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,680
was they have a couple million gallons a

1601
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,359
day of water flowing from the dam into

1602
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,759
this facility that's just flowing out to

1603
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:35,119
the ocean and if they can't find a user

1604
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,799
for the facility they're gonna have to

1605
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,039
sell the water to someone else versus

1606
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:40,400
just redivert it back into the river so

1607
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,079
fundamentally you know when it comes to

1608
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,000
these appellations and it comes to water

1609
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,599
usage it's political because when you're

1610
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,599
when you're when you're putting in you

1611
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,599
know unbelievable operations in the high

1612
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,039
desert high desert's defined by less

1613
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,160
than 10 inches of rain a year so if

1614
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:54,079
you're going to call it high desert then

1615
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:55,920
that's really what it means so you know

1616
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,318
we got we should be we should be popping

1617
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,400
around 70 to 80 inches up in humboldt

1618
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:01,279
which is a phenomenal amount of water

1619
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,880
but they're going to limit us

1620
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,119
tremendously i'm on a very protected

1621
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,599
watershed but the watershed emanates

1622
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,039
from my property so it gives me a chance

1623
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,880
to work and what i'll do is i'll work a

1624
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:12,960
canopy size that lets me get to a level

1625
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,880
that's allowable because really you

1626
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,679
can't you can't beat them right off the

1627
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,280
bat

1628
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,798
and that's why it's it's important for a

1629
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,240
lot of the smaller operators to say

1630
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:22,000
listen if i only have ten thousand

1631
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:24,078
square foot of best five thousand square

1632
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,639
foot then how do you work in conjunction

1633
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,240
with other operators in your watersheds

1634
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:29,920
in your directions to find out you know

1635
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:31,598
what kind of kind of biology biology

1636
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,680
systems do you utilize

1637
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,359
and like what moly was saying which he's

1638
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:37,598
been saying for a while is you guys got

1639
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:40,000
to get together and team up and work on

1640
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,838
these projects together so that you have

1641
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,679
the resources to be able to actually

1642
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:46,078
function because it's expensive

1643
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,358
and with the course of of cannabis

1644
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,599
production right now which is

1645
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:51,199
unbelievable for the smaller operator to

1646
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:54,000
actually function on

1647
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:54,960
this this teamwork is essential

1648
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,880
and so

1649
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,400
as we go forward man it's it's it's

1650
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,318
imperative that a lot of this stuff gets

1651
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,318
brought out but the conversation of can

1652
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:05,039
you grow durbin in alaska we had we had

1653
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:06,719
the similar ideas of can you repeat

1654
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:08,400
the experience of the cannabis because

1655
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,239
what i knew was from me traveling all

1656
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,519
over the world and smoking weed from all

1657
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,279
these places

1658
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,960
no matter how much we grew back at home

1659
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,720
it wasn't the same product

1660
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,318
and we knew that the light was different

1661
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,318
but i didn't understand that light just

1662
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:21,599
wasn't energy light was information once

1663
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:23,039
i started to really mess with the light

1664
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,318
scientists i started to find out that

1665
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,880
it's information

1666
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:29,440
and if we change the spectra we can make

1667
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,760
a plant flower under full 24-hour

1668
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,519
lighting we can make a plant not flower

1669
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,839
we can make it elongate we can change

1670
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:37,519
its shape we can change its profile we

1671
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:39,599
can change soil uptake we can change

1672
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,559
what micro microbial counts and how they

1673
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,720
function

1674
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,640
and so much of that is

1675
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:46,078
is just knowledge that we're learning

1676
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,400
and i think the problem is that what we

1677
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,480
use is we use lab metrics to determine

1678
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,200
quality and so that's one of the issues

1679
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,559
is that you're using total terps total

1680
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:56,879
potency this cannabinoid that

1681
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:59,680
cannabinoid and the fact is that it's

1682
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,519
all in a synthesis and

1683
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:04,719
when you start to say if it isn't above

1684
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:06,719
20 to 22 thc it's not top shelf it

1685
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:08,159
instantly knocks out all these varieties

1686
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:09,838
that are seven and eights and when i was

1687
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:11,679
talking to a colombian that's a

1688
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:13,119
colombian collector out of columbia so

1689
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,879
he's able to collect all the south

1690
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,119
american varieties so he and i have to

1691
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,240
use google translate to talk

1692
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,160
but

1693
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:22,078
for real but the point is that he's a

1694
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:24,078
collector he's an older guy in colombia

1695
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,200
who collects in colombia

1696
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,280
and

1697
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:28,879
what he was saying is hey the only

1698
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,640
reason why you guys aren't getting the

1699
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,798
effect you want off of these varieties

1700
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:35,039
is because you're you're muddied with

1701
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:37,039
the the afghani cannabis that you're

1702
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:39,039
smoking he said it basically muddied you

1703
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:40,558
up and you need to cleanse your system

1704
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,400
and then you'll get back to being able

1705
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,640
to experience the effects you want off

1706
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,880
these seven and eight percent strains

1707
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,598
and and i always look at the total terps

1708
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,599
as irrelevant because it's what terpenes

1709
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,359
are present not the total concentration

1710
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,880
of them that's why i don't like stuff i

1711
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,039
always jam on terpinator because i call

1712
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,119
it homogenator it makes everything taste

1713
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,358
a goddamn same so yeah i'm glad it has

1714
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,480
hot numbers but it's it's homogenized

1715
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:04,318
cannabis

1716
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,240
and and a lot of this is trying to get

1717
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:08,558
the the market to understand it and i

1718
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:10,798
just got jammed by someone on on plants

1719
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,640
that i submitted to a competition of why

1720
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:14,079
did i submit this plan i said because i

1721
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:16,239
want the competitors to be able to sell

1722
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,680
the product and if i give them something

1723
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:19,919
like some laos that i'm messing around

1724
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:21,679
with right now or some of some some

1725
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,318
from laos or from nepal

1726
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:25,838
for one it's going to have lower numbers

1727
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:27,599
and it's not going to move on the shelf

1728
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:28,880
because of it wait wait wait wait you're

1729
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,760
saying the low you know the lower

1730
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,599
numbers this industry in particular has

1731
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,040
never said these words to people

1732
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,680
whenever i say to them they go you're

1733
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:39,440
right low number just take another hit

1734
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:41,199
for god's sakes i mean you know i mean

1735
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,400
but they see it as an economic concern

1736
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:44,000
though like for someone who owns

1737
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,880
dispensaries someone who actually owns

1738
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,519
stores right for a long time

1739
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,160
it is you have to gently

1740
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:53,679
educate them and say listen just because

1741
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:55,759
it says this number doesn't mean you're

1742
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:56,960
going to get to smoke less because it

1743
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,400
doesn't really

1744
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,159
it isn't true

1745
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,240
the the numbers don't dictate the

1746
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:04,239
reality but they dictate an economic

1747
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:05,838
reality just like terpene numbers doing

1748
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:08,879
so i had a friend that had a you know

1749
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:11,358
5.6 percent terps and i showed him a 2.2

1750
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,680
terp strain and the 2.2 was volatile oh

1751
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:16,000
we did we did we did it to ourselves but

1752
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:17,440
the problem is we have to undo it

1753
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,519
because what we've done is we created a

1754
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,679
situation where the diversity is almost

1755
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,679
impossible to put out if it isn't at

1756
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:26,318
these atmos at

1757
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:28,480
tremendous levels of numerics and i'm

1758
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:30,480
somebody who breeds things to go into

1759
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,280
heavy numerics where i chase these upper

1760
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,119
30s i i put them in because it's

1761
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,440
marketability and i tell people why i'm

1762
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,960
doing it and it's not my entire project

1763
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,679
it's just that when you want to make

1764
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,280
money in modern cannabis and you need to

1765
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:44,798
or you're going to go broke that shit

1766
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,480
better have hot numbers

1767
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:47,599
and it doesn't mean it's better and it

1768
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,559
doesn't mean that it's going to get you

1769
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,519
higher and it doesn't mean it's going to

1770
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:53,519
be a better experience but the market is

1771
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:55,039
obsessed with it and even the ranking

1772
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:56,480
systems coming in through some of these

1773
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,318
farmer federations are trying to

1774
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,599
quantify the same thing that a top shelf

1775
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:03,039
five star is you know over 22. and the

1776
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,480
reality is

1777
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,798
i think that we really have to have an

1778
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,119
educational system come into play so

1779
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,880
that the the users start to understand

1780
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:14,240
that the metrics are something you look

1781
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,000
at after the fact not first you look at

1782
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:18,399
the numbers after and say hey that's

1783
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,239
interesting this is the unique terpene

1784
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,599
profile that made this happen perhaps

1785
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:23,838
and these are these interesting

1786
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,599
cannabinoids that i'm experiencing and

1787
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:27,119
it starts to allow you to see patterns

1788
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,280
and those patterns let you find other

1789
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,358
varietals that are similar so that you

1790
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,440
have a better range of choices because

1791
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:34,960
in these limited production models you

1792
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,200
won't be able to get it dispersed

1793
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,039
throughout the whole state so this stuff

1794
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:40,879
should have gone sorry man no i was just

1795
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,440
gonna ask specifically do you still mess

1796
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,400
with the 78 the six cut yeah yeah i

1797
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,159
still messed up

1798
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,358
like five five years ago that was like

1799
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:49,118
we were like talking about like you they

1800
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:51,759
had like recalibrate the machine for the

1801
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,960
highest cbd dominant overall cannabinoid

1802
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,440
strain ever found it was like yeah but

1803
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,920
it was like 6963 and it was like it was

1804
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,318
an og yeah and i mean it was great and

1805
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,480
it i mean like i made great hash out of

1806
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:04,079
it frenchy made great hash out of it

1807
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,000
we all smoked it we all enjoyed it we

1808
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,760
had a very cerebral experience kept on

1809
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,599
going back for more like that was our

1810
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,200
like little strain and i was like my it

1811
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,880
was like my favorite thing and then you

1812
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:14,480
know like the madrone picked it up and

1813
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,440
those guys have been running with it so

1814
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:19,519
it's like there is a market for it and

1815
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,119
for for for that for that full profile

1816
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:22,960
what's the rate what's the ratio on that

1817
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,200
it was 16

1818
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,199
nine six three was mine it was 16 nine

1819
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:30,078
on the on the cbd and then six three on

1820
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:31,519
the thc and it was an og it was a 78 and

1821
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,200
it was the number six i think it was a

1822
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,199
six or eight the six the eight phenol

1823
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:36,719
then i have a ten female that uh the the

1824
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:39,279
ten cut that comes out at around

1825
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:41,118
nineteen 1908 and then like uh 10-2 yeah

1826
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,839
and so when we did that i think i had a

1827
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,440
combined canon later maybe like 33.5

1828
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:47,119
which at the time had never been seen in

1829
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,039
a cbd dominant cultivar but these are

1830
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,079
outliers and because see the thing is i

1831
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,558
got lucky

1832
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:54,318
in that when when labs came out i was

1833
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,480
one of the first people that was playing

1834
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:57,358
around with them so i got access to labs

1835
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,440
quick

1836
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:01,920
and i understood how to use the tool

1837
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,838
that let me see inside so i could steer

1838
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,639
directions and those directions are

1839
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:08,880
where we drove cbd in america so it was

1840
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,879
the the my crew in arcata went through

1841
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,400
the cantatonics and then and then ringo

1842
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,160
went through ringo's line but that was

1843
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,920
that was the basis of all cbd material

1844
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:17,279
you have in america today came out of

1845
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,880
those projects

1846
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,039
but i wasn't caught up with that for me

1847
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,640
with the cbd work once i found cultivars

1848
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,880
and had a variety of them that had

1849
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:26,318
certain ratios what i did is i just put

1850
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,119
them into the market

1851
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:30,719
i was i was more driven into

1852
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,680
what i would call you know recreational

1853
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:35,679
cannabis and and so i used my my

1854
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:38,078
predicate of work to steer directions in

1855
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:40,078
that so i could get these jammed numbers

1856
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,079
because what it did was it let us move

1857
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,839
let us move product and then it let me

1858
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,359
put cuttings in the hands of farmers

1859
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:47,679
that could then make money moving those

1860
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:49,759
pieces and part of it was to explain to

1861
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:52,000
the public at the same time these are

1862
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,799
numbers that you used to sell but this

1863
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,719
is an 11 that you want to enjoy

1864
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:58,639
and so we would give the education but

1865
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:00,078
man you got to sell the weed in order to

1866
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:01,679
stay in business so let me make the

1867
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,318
suggestion next time

1868
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:06,239
because i have a dispensary in in oregon

1869
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:08,239
that does this

1870
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,759
so most of the weed in oregon has now

1871
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:12,239
gotten really cheap

1872
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,960
this stuff he sells for 25 bucks a gram

1873
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:17,519
yeah it's got low numbers yeah it's

1874
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,920
killer wheat but it's got low numbers

1875
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:22,079
instead of putting the numbers down

1876
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,920
it's the price people look at

1877
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:28,000
and so he's charging 25 bucks a gram

1878
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,559
for something that by numbers people

1879
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,079
might pay six four oh yeah no it's just

1880
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,760
it can't keep it on the shelf the

1881
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,680
numbers are right on the product though

1882
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,119
now like the the numbers are what you

1883
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,879
can't see oregon's different than

1884
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,240
california where oregon still allows you

1885
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,920
to smell the wheat

1886
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:44,239
oregon oregon still lets you open the

1887
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,240
jar

1888
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:47,519
we can't let the government in

1889
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,639
california say you're not allowed to do

1890
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:51,038
that anymore come on what are you

1891
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:54,000
talking about this is our industry not

1892
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,520
your industry let us do what we want to

1893
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,960
do you know i mean it's not going to

1894
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:58,400
kill anybody if you

1895
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,838
yeah anyway sorry well

1896
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,079
that's that's to i think to me that's

1897
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:03,119
fundamentally uh tax base where it's

1898
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,480
it's not so much they're afraid you're

1899
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,160
gonna smell it but they're afraid that a

1900
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,679
little nugget might fall out of that

1901
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:08,798
open container into someone's hand for

1902
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,639
free

1903
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:11,838
and so you know when we saw this happen

1904
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:13,519
and when we we used to do a lot of

1905
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:16,480
giveaways i was involved in a tremendous

1906
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:18,880
amount of uh free cbd where i've never

1907
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,920
sold any cbd and i've been in in in the

1908
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,838
industry fuck forever but i've been in

1909
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,000
you know dispensary operations now for

1910
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:28,480
probably almost 11 years and for the 11

1911
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,079
years i've never sold any cbd material

1912
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,079
if you if you came to me for cb material

1913
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:34,240
you got it for free and you know it was

1914
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,318
probably about 120 000 free clones that

1915
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:37,679
went through on books another 30 000

1916
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:40,079
that we kicked on the side so maybe you

1917
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:42,960
know 150 000 clones i kicked out for

1918
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:45,119
free and then probably another ungodly

1919
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,639
amount of tinctures rso and all these

1920
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,000
other components because

1921
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:49,920
there was a there was a greater good

1922
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,280
that was involved and

1923
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,720
we knew that that was going to come to

1924
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,400
an end and that's why we kind of went at

1925
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:55,679
it so hard because we knew at some point

1926
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,680
in time there's no way anybody was going

1927
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:59,519
to allow us to do this much charity we

1928
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:00,960
just knew it was coming and so that's

1929
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:02,159
the problem is that

1930
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,400
you know we you want to fight the

1931
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,838
government on this crap but

1932
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,119
fundamentally you need to have the

1933
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:11,199
finances to survive long enough to do it

1934
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,358
and they've done such a good job by

1935
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:15,358
limiting what one can do and how one

1936
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:17,679
does it but i think so many people right

1937
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:19,920
now are just financially crippled and

1938
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:21,598
it's really stopping any kind of battle

1939
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,960
to where you you have to work with these

1940
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,119
realities and i think part of the

1941
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,679
reality is have varietals that you can

1942
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:30,720
use as as attractions

1943
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:32,879
and then create the the awareness of

1944
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,639
what is an experience of cannabis how do

1945
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,240
we quantify it does one just want to get

1946
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,358
affected does one want a quality of

1947
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,358
effect

1948
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:40,880
and it's the new individuals that are

1949
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:42,719
coming in that you'll be able to start

1950
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,880
to give this this information to because

1951
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:47,038
they don't have a back history

1952
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,318
those in those individuals aren't coming

1953
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,240
in

1954
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:52,400
in the way they should be because of

1955
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:54,159
this feedback loop between the money and

1956
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,240
the high numbers right like

1957
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:58,318
everybody's a little bit caught in this

1958
01:05:56,239 --> 01:05:59,598
trap that is a side effect of

1959
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:02,079
prohibition

1960
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,680
everyone's making moonshine

1961
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,440
and they're just and moonshine is an

1962
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:07,759
artifact of prohibition

1963
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,639
you know you want that high potency

1964
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:13,039
stuff for storage and transport

1965
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:16,798
because shit is illegal

1966
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:18,880
and when prohibition goes away

1967
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:20,639
an industry is supposed to evolve into

1968
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,000
variety they're supposed to evolve

1969
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:25,199
they're supposed to start making pinot

1970
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,559
grigio that civilians can appreciate

1971
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:28,558
but

1972
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,559
we have this existing market base that

1973
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,039
will pay for stuff and there's all this

1974
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,440
financial pressure and there's gluts on

1975
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,119
the market and everybody just wants to

1976
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,920
it's just this very short-term thinking

1977
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:41,760
like i gotta hit 30 so i can move stuff

1978
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,200
because otherwise i'm gonna die and

1979
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,559
we're and we're still

1980
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:46,879
it's like we're acting like we're still

1981
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:48,400
in prohibition no one's willing to take

1982
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:51,440
the leap to make

1983
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,519
plants that smell outrageous and they're

1984
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,960
incredibly low numbers

1985
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:57,119
and you can bring them and you can smoke

1986
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,679
them at thanksgiving with your whole

1987
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,119
family and all the old people and it's

1988
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:03,519
and like there's just

1989
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,280
thousands of people that aren't coming

1990
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:07,519
into shops

1991
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,798
and i know dispensary owners who

1992
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:10,960
who

1993
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:12,239
want to start bringing in those people

1994
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,280
but they can't because they're like i'm

1995
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:15,358
not going to carry that stuff on my

1996
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,039
shelf because it doesn't move and it

1997
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:18,480
doesn't move because they won't carry it

1998
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:19,280
on their shelves and they won't market

1999
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,880
it

2000
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,280
and so

2001
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:26,400
everyone's in this financial jam

2002
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:29,200
selling to these like

2003
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,720
you know 200 000 consumers just smoke

2004
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:34,480
all the cannabis

2005
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:35,919
and only want numbers in the 30s

2006
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,199
and it's like we're on this wheel it's

2007
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,318
like we have to take a second and get

2008
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,399
off the wheel and look at the fact that

2009
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:41,838
everybody would like to smoke some pot

2010
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,280
the floor you just

2011
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:45,199
the flower market can learn a lot from

2012
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,039
the low dose edible market right now

2013
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:49,038
yeah the edibles have figured this out

2014
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:52,559
way before people's figured it out i

2015
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:55,200
can't tell you how many like you know 45

2016
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:58,000
to 60 year old you know uh you know

2017
01:07:55,199 --> 01:08:01,679
women or you know or are gentlemen are

2018
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,159
you know 2.5 or 3 milligrams 3 milligram

2019
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:05,118
dose and you know and they love it

2020
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:07,598
they're happening

2021
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:09,280
we didn't get down to 2.5 to like last

2022
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,359
year last year so it took until last

2023
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,359
year for anyone to get under five

2024
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,960
and also like one chocolate people were

2025
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:16,719
like and it's so funny because you look

2026
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,759
at these like ladies at like concerts

2027
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,920
and stuff like that with their little

2028
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,838
kiva tins and they pull the little kiva

2029
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,319
tin and they take like one little bean

2030
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:25,838
and they're like would you like one but

2031
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,679
i'm like they're micro doses they're

2032
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:28,640
sure yeah they're they're microsoft

2033
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,679
you know what they'd really like to do

2034
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,199
they'd like to take out a little

2035
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,399
pre-roll that's like four percent and

2036
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:35,119
just be like

2037
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:37,599
well so i smoked 12 to 14. i smoked 12

2038
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:39,439
to 14 and i and and i you know and so

2039
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,440
like in founding the exchange and many

2040
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:43,439
other markets i've always grown i i

2041
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:46,639
worked with equilibrium growing um

2042
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:48,639
african-based uh sativas

2043
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,079
that's what i smoke and pineapple

2044
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,440
because i'm from i'm from a pineapple

2045
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:52,798
region right so it's like i like smoking

2046
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:54,719
in the pies like good in the pines is

2047
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:57,119
between like around 14

2048
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,198
so if i smoke if i smoke that pie in the

2049
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,198
pines you know or at least derek's cut i

2050
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:03,439
smoke that i'm having a great time i

2051
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:05,919
want to do my taxes if i smoke the

2052
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,519
afghani i want to run from my taxes i'm

2053
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,119
like fuck you know it's like hiding up

2054
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,560
in my mom's bed with like sweating and

2055
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:12,399
all that you know so i don't i don't

2056
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,400
want to do that but so the idea that

2057
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:17,278
there is that that market is emerging

2058
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:19,119
but when i smoke at like an exchange

2059
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,279
and somebody comes to me for a higher

2060
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:23,679
dose you know and i smoke a pineapple or

2061
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,880
i smoke a you know a malawi or something

2062
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,279
they feel like almost they're having a

2063
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,600
psychedelic they're actually having fun

2064
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:31,520
they enjoy enjoying themselves on

2065
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,199
cannabis they're like this is great what

2066
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,839
did you put in there but that's exposure

2067
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:38,000
see i i use my girl as the as the i call

2068
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,920
it like my wheat guinea pig for for what

2069
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,759
i call the lower octane strains because

2070
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,759
everything that i was smoking was too

2071
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,359
strong for her and so i went through a

2072
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:46,880
couple years of sifting period where i

2073
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,239
was able to get into some of mean jeans

2074
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,960
lines and i was able to pull out this

2075
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:52,318
beautiful cherry back cross and i i bred

2076
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,480
into it and pulled out maybe you know

2077
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,000
something comes around like 12 too

2078
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:57,919
but it's beautiful and it's got a really

2079
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,520
rich quality and the flavor's right and

2080
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,679
for people who smoke it it's it's

2081
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,600
unbelievably satisfying

2082
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,880
but i'm telling you put that stuff on

2083
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,039
the shelf

2084
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,840
and you it sits there because of the

2085
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:11,519
numbers there has to be some system that

2086
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,079
that comes where you start to have the

2087
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:16,239
ability to get people to come in

2088
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:18,479
and actually experience cannabis and

2089
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:20,319
then see the numbers afterwards it's

2090
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:21,839
called marketing and we call it cannabis

2091
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:23,519
light yeah we just don't have the but

2092
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,039
the thing is you're competing you're

2093
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,159
you're competing the marketing part's

2094
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:27,600
hard because you're having to compete

2095
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:29,439
with people that are that have the

2096
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,280
ability like the emerald exchange and

2097
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:33,198
events like you used to do no worries

2098
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:35,759
brother was that it allowed you to have

2099
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:38,319
people come and actually be present

2100
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,840
and it lets you now have cultivators

2101
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:41,679
that's where the problem with all the

2102
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,239
cultivation where the farmers can't sell

2103
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:45,840
direct the farmers can't have tastings

2104
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:47,119
you know they you can do it illicitly

2105
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,600
but the problem is that's not going to

2106
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:51,279
allow you any kind of real penetration

2107
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,960
and if you had that then what you could

2108
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:55,679
do is you could have a real diversity in

2109
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:58,000
your lines where you had a true gradient

2110
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:00,719
and the gradients can be based off of

2111
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,238
potency gradients and also how you feel

2112
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,239
from the varietal and that's based off

2113
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:06,319
the terpene relationships and so you'd

2114
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:08,639
be able to have true gradients that

2115
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:10,238
matched what you wanted to release from

2116
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,159
your farm and it would have things that

2117
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:14,718
would satisfy people who wanted more

2118
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:16,399
broad-based stuff up to a you know to

2119
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:18,319
peel the pillow topiad or if you're if

2120
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:20,079
you skull

2121
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:22,000
and some people like that too so i don't

2122
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:24,399
i don't throw rocks at anybody what they

2123
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,800
like some people like uh you know thc

2124
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:28,559
isolate where they want that stuff at 99

2125
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,719
percent and that's what they like

2126
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,640
let's let's make that awesome yeah yeah

2127
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,000
no it all has to it no it's full it all

2128
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,600
has to be there

2129
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,039
it's just that traditionally that's

2130
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,320
that's been the problems and that's why

2131
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:40,399
someone asked me they said why did you

2132
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,880
chase such high thc varieties for so

2133
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:45,359
long and develop males to throw those

2134
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:48,079
numbers on other plants i said because

2135
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:49,920
it sold and it allowed individuals to be

2136
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:52,158
able to have sellable varieties which

2137
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,158
kept them in business and so now we have

2138
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:56,238
to redo just like back in the day i used

2139
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:57,920
to go hunt varietals and had low scent

2140
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:59,759
signatures and people say why would you

2141
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,840
do that i said because i'm somebody who

2142
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,679
was here before charcoal so before

2143
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,199
charcoal technology came out you'd have

2144
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,359
a full pair of balls to grow dope

2145
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:08,639
illegally or otherwise you'll be about

2146
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:09,920
to have a heart attack when you pulled

2147
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,360
into your driveway and the whole

2148
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,800
neighborhood wreaked and you were

2149
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:14,960
looking at catching a felony case and

2150
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,640
going to prison and so i would

2151
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,480
yeah i would hunt

2152
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:21,280
i would hunt varietals that had low

2153
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:22,879
scent and it allowed us to cultivate and

2154
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:25,198
move and so i mean by the time i'm done

2155
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,880
with this we end up snuffing out a huge

2156
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:29,519
portion of the population but that was a

2157
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,880
function of illegality also mostly so

2158
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,719
upsetting

2159
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,239
i'm sorry oh no yeah you don't you think

2160
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:36,640
i i'm digging it

2161
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:38,479
it i had my own library of stuff i would

2162
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,640
keep because i was somebody that was

2163
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:43,359
basically a lunatic so i could handle

2164
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,920
the risk i i was pretty ballsy but for

2165
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:48,000
the clients that i built operations for

2166
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,279
that wasn't the case for all of them and

2167
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,359
so for these people that wanted to

2168
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:52,559
cultivate cannabis in you know the early

2169
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:53,920
90s

2170
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,800
when you know the indoor was really

2171
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:59,039
taken off it had to be and charcoal

2172
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,119
wasn't present and and i was using a

2173
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:03,439
high-tech ozone at the time to where i

2174
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:05,119
could blow the ducks of a building clean

2175
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:06,639
but regular people didn't have access to

2176
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:08,000
this stuff and so it was really a

2177
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,600
function of what could you cultivate and

2178
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,920
grow and then we would have things that

2179
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,440
were higher level and so all this stuff

2180
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,359
that we that gets us here is all a

2181
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:16,960
result of prohibition and that's why for

2182
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:19,279
me i'm trying to go back in time and

2183
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,039
mind the things that we've lost most of

2184
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:23,439
the libraries that we held for so much

2185
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:25,519
of us have got taken in raids so between

2186
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:26,960
raids and armed robberies we've lost a

2187
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:29,760
tremendous amount of genealogical

2188
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,760
material yeah and but that was just

2189
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,679
that's how it was i mean i could lament

2190
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,960
the the story but it's just it is what

2191
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,640
it what it is

2192
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,000
and it's trying to you know move forward

2193
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,679
from here and that's why i give people

2194
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,960
the background on it and i explained to

2195
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,319
them look this is why i chase the

2196
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,039
numbers but this is why i'm trying to

2197
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:47,279
expose you to an 11 varietal

2198
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:49,920
my position let's do it yeah i had you

2199
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:51,679
had to do it but but listen like

2200
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,119
everybody's fighting for their lives now

2201
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:54,719
right

2202
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:55,760
but i don't think people are taking this

2203
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:58,399
seriously

2204
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,159
the the massive

2205
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:01,839
the massive farms and the companies that

2206
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:02,559
are

2207
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,199
just

2208
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,800
they're just after oil just after thc

2209
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:08,719
they're just cannabinoid production

2210
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,600
companies right

2211
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:11,840
so

2212
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,039
if we stay in this market where we're

2213
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,279
chasing

2214
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:18,800
numbers in the 30s for thc and we're

2215
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:20,238
making oil in the 90s

2216
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,679
it's like

2217
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:24,079
i'm going to have a little farm and i'm

2218
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:28,119
going to compete with big ag who's

2219
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:28,119
growing fields of thc

2220
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:31,759
we can't compete in the thc market the

2221
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,158
thc market

2222
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,600
the high thc market is now

2223
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:37,439
kind of gone

2224
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,719
if if we're gonna have appalachians if

2225
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,039
we're gonna have small farms that

2226
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,880
survive

2227
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:43,920
a ton of thc

2228
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,039
it's just not where they're going to

2229
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,880
compete

2230
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:48,719
they have to find other niches and it's

2231
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,719
not just because i want to smoke that

2232
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,480
stuff and because it'll bring in other

2233
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:53,679
customers who are interested

2234
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:55,759
it's just that

2235
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,920
that

2236
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,640
thing that was prohibited

2237
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,158
prohibited in prohibition

2238
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,159
big companies are taking that now and

2239
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:05,759
that should not be our job anymore so

2240
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:06,960
the question is how do we get there i

2241
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,640
mean and i can see a couple of different

2242
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,640
ways i mean one the work that you're

2243
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,800
doing you know there's i don't know i

2244
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,000
don't know how it's how it shows up on a

2245
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,159
strain

2246
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,319
so when i when i go and buy a durbin

2247
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:20,719
poison then i know that's really durban

2248
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:22,559
poisoning because you said the dnas

2249
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:24,000
would you know what's is there a stamp

2250
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,920
that's going to be developed yeah

2251
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,359
there's a stamp and listen if i was in

2252
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,760
alaska and i wanted to grow durbin

2253
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:31,599
poison i would go to humboldt i would go

2254
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,520
to south africa and i'd get the right

2255
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,520
soil and i'd get the derby poison and

2256
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,280
i'd go to alaska and i would grow it in

2257
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,199
that local soil and i would put the

2258
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:41,359
magic light over it and dial the light

2259
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:43,198
in until it was like the right latitude

2260
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:45,920
but but i wouldn't try to get the

2261
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:47,279
appalachian durban poison right because

2262
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,640
the reason for the appellation is like

2263
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:51,840
you're not protecting the ip around the

2264
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,199
plate the ip the soil is the ip

2265
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,880
right there they're protecting their

2266
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:57,039
locals

2267
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,800
and you couldn't get it you couldn't you

2268
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:00,399
couldn't get an appellation around it

2269
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,600
and and what we're doing in appalachian

2270
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:05,198
development is experience driven right

2271
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,120
so it's like come experience the

2272
01:16:05,198 --> 01:16:09,678
cultural heritage of the region as well

2273
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:11,198
so i mean it's like we're diversifying

2274
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,960
you know a lot of us up there you know

2275
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:14,799
we it's back to the landers we're

2276
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,880
economic refugees we came up there for a

2277
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,800
simpler way of life we like to build our

2278
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,480
own shit like this is what we want to do

2279
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,760
we want to share that with the world we

2280
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:23,039
want to share our permaculture knowledge

2281
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,480
we want to share our strained

2282
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:26,560
development knowledge we want to share

2283
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,678
the history heritage we want to we want

2284
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,000
to feed you

2285
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:31,440
right you know we want all of these

2286
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,359
things and that's what we're doing so i

2287
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:36,399
mean at the end of the day we're not in

2288
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:38,719
the same market as these guys i'm not

2289
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:40,960
i'm not worried about big agra coming in

2290
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,800
and ruining our our region because at

2291
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:45,039
the end of the day i mean we're capped

2292
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,880
at 10 000 square feet we're and we're

2293
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:49,439
geographically isolated to a point with

2294
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,560
why would big ag and you're organic yeah

2295
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:52,399
well

2296
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,239
exactly beyond organic and it's why

2297
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:55,679
would we why would big ag want to go two

2298
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:57,839
and a half hours on the back side of

2299
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,719
fucking iron peak you know what i'm

2300
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,400
saying to get a 10 000 square foot grow

2301
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:04,079
for a commodities market it doesn't even

2302
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:05,679
make sense yeah but can you survive

2303
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:08,079
selling your flour to your to your

2304
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,679
neighbors i mean that is where yeah no

2305
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:11,679
it's not to our neighbors

2306
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:13,920
so you know in in initiatives and i

2307
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,600
don't like self-you know self-promotion

2308
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,480
or whatever but it's like initiatives of

2309
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:20,400
micro branding your brand so like so we

2310
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:23,279
are taking it's mic it's micro branding

2311
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:25,359
so so we take small brands right we take

2312
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:26,158
people out of the hills we incentivize

2313
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:28,158
them

2314
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:29,599
to start off in the branding space now

2315
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:32,079
there's an evolution to that which is

2316
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,840
cooperatives right so they start off

2317
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:35,439
everyone wants to be king of the hill

2318
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,679
everyone would be king of the castle i

2319
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:39,439
did it the best i do it the best i am

2320
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:41,600
the best and then all other sudden they

2321
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:43,198
realize they're like hey can you sell my

2322
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,719
weed you know and it's like they're

2323
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:47,198
starting to depend on their neighbors

2324
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:49,039
again like they always have and so the

2325
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:52,000
cooperative forms now the cooperative

2326
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:53,439
may be a series of micro brands acting

2327
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,679
as molten we're seeing that with true

2328
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:57,279
humble but still has little monikers on

2329
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:00,079
or the little tags for each one of the

2330
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:01,759
farms or arcana everyone wants their own

2331
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:04,000
three sisters all these different things

2332
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,039
you know now we've got uh emerald groans

2333
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,238
coming out they're they're you know

2334
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:07,840
they're going to be a ton of micro

2335
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:10,000
brands you know but then you have

2336
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,119
flocana which started out hey we're

2337
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,560
going to be a bunch of microbrands and

2338
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:15,119
they're like

2339
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,719
maybe we're going to be one big brand

2340
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,158
and so then you have a cooper an

2341
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:20,079
agriculture cooperative that shows up

2342
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:22,399
like flakkana so then you have this one

2343
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:24,640
big brand of of weed called flocan that

2344
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:27,119
goes out onto the shelves so you have

2345
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,560
you know small micro brands micro brands

2346
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,800
acting as a cooperative and you have

2347
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,560
larger cooperatives of farmers acting as

2348
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,640
a single brand it follows the coffee

2349
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,080
model it follows the wine model i mean

2350
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,079
but the appellation of origin and the

2351
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:39,439
control and the governance behind the ip

2352
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,679
protections for each one of these

2353
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:43,599
regions actually gets to dictate the

2354
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:46,239
standards of quality in which they are

2355
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,159
allowed to grow in that region so they

2356
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:50,000
they actually make their own rules the

2357
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:51,920
state doesn't hand down a set of rules

2358
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,560
i've been with cdfa now for

2359
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,239
three weeks traveling around the state i

2360
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,760
saw you up in humble you know it's like

2361
01:18:56,238 --> 01:18:59,198
we were just out in palm desert palm

2362
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,560
desert said we're not going to be in

2363
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:02,879
appalachian i said good because you're

2364
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:04,800
doing it on stolen water you know it's

2365
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,199
like they don't want it

2366
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,880
it's like that's yeah yeah good luck you

2367
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:11,359
know but the idea is they have they want

2368
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:14,000
a geographical indication right grown in

2369
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:16,399
the desert not of the desert because

2370
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,039
they're not grown of the desert right

2371
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:20,960
so these aocs that are forming these

2372
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,399
collectives these cooperatives that set

2373
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,719
their own rules to set their own

2374
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:27,759
standards themselves get to government

2375
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:30,399
this is an attractive you know this is a

2376
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:33,039
proposition to a consumer that can only

2377
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:35,759
get that product in one place only one

2378
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:38,800
place right it can be distributed

2379
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,199
to small you know dispensaries around

2380
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:44,480
but the product can't be produced at a

2381
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:47,119
scale that can feed the masses let them

2382
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:49,839
have the central valley unfortunately

2383
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:51,519
you know but let us have the small the

2384
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,279
craft the artisanal let's take that

2385
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,920
model let's take that market that's our

2386
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:56,960
market and it and you know and i don't

2387
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,399
think we're

2388
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,480
worried at all i mean you don't think

2389
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:03,519
you have to move stuff down to the city

2390
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:07,519
i am a fuck dude you know okay so i surf

2391
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:09,679
i surf right now 14 days out of 28 the

2392
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,520
other 14 i'm up with my kids

2393
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:13,359
the reason i i'm down here surfing

2394
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,639
venice break water almost every single

2395
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:15,599
morning and every single night is

2396
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:18,000

i have to be down here selling weed like

2398
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,560
this is where the market is this is

2399
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,039
where i have to bring cannabis i i wish

2400
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,960
to god i could just meet somebody at the

2401
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:28,800
end of my driveway get a duffel bag of

2402
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:32,079

the code and we need to count the cash

2410
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:49,520
because

2411
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:51,279

2412

consultants we're gonna be become

2418
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:03,519
everything we never wanted to be just to

2419
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:04,639
survive but the thing is is we are going

2420
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,000
to survive

2421
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:07,520

2422
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,920

of touched on it i hate all sorry it's

2446
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,079
lance mowgli

2447
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:52,880
[Laughter]

2448
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:54,399
um

2449
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,480
you know you guys i hate comparing our

2450
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:58,000
industry to alcohol but it's true micro

2451
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:59,519
macro and justin and i just talked about

2452
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,760
this on a boat in long beach the other

2453
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,520
day um i think that's the only way it

2454
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,960
has to go and justin's spot on with that

2455
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,639
there's something that can't be emulated

2456
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,000
on what's going on in the triangle

2457
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:10,239
that's what's going to make it unique he

2458
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,840
introduced me to hidden prairie farms by

2459
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:13,039
far the best fire blue skittles i've

2460
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,400
ever had it'll stay that way and i'll

2461
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:16,000
pay all the money for we just talked

2462
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:17,039
about used to getting free product but

2463
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,800
there's some product you're willing to

2464
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:20,399
pay for if you don't make it yourself

2465
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,960
but what do you guys think about as far

2466
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:24,479
as the evolution beyond the micro macro

2467
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,920
you're talking about the race to the top

2468
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:28,879
which is sad for the states that

2469
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,800
everyone's to your point 34 35 38 who

2470
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,800
knows if it's real on thc

2471
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:35,279
when do you think that the 2.0 is going

2472
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,880
to come in where it stops being a race

2473
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:39,439
it stops me in the dumb question of

2474
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:42,000
indica sativa or hybrid and it gets into

2475
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:44,238
more of uh what's your terpene profile

2476
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,520
is mercying for the win is lemony what

2477
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:46,959
is it for you

2478
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,400
and i kind of know your answer kevin but

2479
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,239
i think everyone would like to hear some

2480
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:52,399
on the same page i think yeah i think

2481
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:54,799
that for the craft regions it's really

2482
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:57,119
about getting it and it's beginning it's

2483
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,239
it's it's to get the people see remember

2484
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:00,238
most of these craft regions like

2485
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:02,718
humboldt's a really good example because

2486
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:04,959
humboldt is is unique in california in

2487
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:07,359
terms of ownership of property so most

2488
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,520
of california has a disproportionate

2489
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:11,599
amount of state and federal land versus

2490
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,440
private ownership humble has the most

2491
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,719
private ownership of any any county in

2492
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:16,000
california

2493
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:18,000
which means that people really haven't

2494
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,439
seen humboldt county so it's it's just

2495
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,399
words it's coming from humboldt what

2496
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:21,678
does that mean

2497
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:22,638
and so what you're seeing right now

2498
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:24,560
though is

2499
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:27,359
the first time where we've been able to

2500
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:29,760
work with the the the people who run

2501
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:31,839
humble county in terms of tourism

2502
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,760
and in humboldt made

2503
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,000
and in the ability to get people to come

2504
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,239
in and start to really be exposed to the

2505
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,039
farms directly so we're working so

2506
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:42,879
heavily on the tourism aspect to allow

2507
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:44,960
individuals to come in

2508
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,880
and start to experience what the farmer

2509
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,480
has to offer because the farmer can have

2510
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,079
a conversation now the the way we're

2511
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:51,919
working it is the farmer can have the

2512
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:53,920
conversation someone like me has to sell

2513
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,279
the products i have the license but all

2514
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,800
i'm doing is selling the product that

2515
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:58,800
the farmer's convincing the people that

2516
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,880
they want to try based off of what the

2517
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:03,440
individual's asking for

2518
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,119
and so when i when i when i look at

2519
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:07,198
storefronts

2520
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:08,880
the person who controls the destiny of

2521
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:11,039
your farm is someone who's making under

2522
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:12,079
fifteen dollars an hour right so under

2523
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:14,079
fifteen dollars an hour they're

2524
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:15,600
controlling the success of your farm

2525
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:17,439
because they're a bud tender and that's

2526
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,480
not meant in any disrespectful way about

2527
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:21,279
money

2528
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:23,359
or in skill it's just that it's it's

2529
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:26,079
somebody who's at the counter is being

2530
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:27,519
asked questions so few people actually

2531
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:28,800
come in and ask for something

2532
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,520
specifically

2533
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:33,360
only a couple companies have that type

2534
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:36,800
of market penetration

2535
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:38,960
and it it comes down to the individuals

2536
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,800
have to start to want to know

2537
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:42,158
the product they're buying from who's

2538
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,920
creating it

2539
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:46,079
and based off of what these individuals

2540
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,719
are trying to create and so i think that

2541
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:50,639
the craft regions and as we go forward

2542
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,880
the way you get around

2543
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,719
this lack of understanding is to allow

2544
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:57,520
the tourism to increase which it's

2545
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:59,600
beginning and we can see it clearly now

2546
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,000
and they're starting to come in

2547
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,199
and you allow the farmers to to to

2548
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,198
actually

2549
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:06,719
converse with these people

2550
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:08,399
so they can ask the farmer what are you

2551
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:10,639
growing what are you doing what do you

2552
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:12,238
recommend for me for what i'm seeking

2553
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:14,639
because it isn't just about a single

2554
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:17,039
terpene it's not about um i just want

2555
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:18,960
this for maybe for opiate replacement it

2556
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:20,880
kind of is and we can say that limonene

2557
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,480
drives you drives you up and we can say

2558
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,319
corophylline drives you down and so we

2559
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:27,279
can make broad generalizations based off

2560
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:29,279
of how we see terps but fundamentally

2561
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:30,960
you want to be able to have the farmers

2562
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:33,279
who are cultivating and working on their

2563
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,198
own diverse varietal packages

2564
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:37,198
things that make them unique in terms of

2565
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:39,119
i don't grow the same thing justin does

2566
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:41,119
and i might desire to send you a

2567
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:42,880
different direction when the people come

2568
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:44,559
in they're allowed to see these things

2569
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:46,319
experience them

2570
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,840
and then they do the word of mouth

2571
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:49,679
they're the ones that drive that

2572
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,840
direction forward they're the ones that

2573
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:54,079
go back to their home of origin and say

2574
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:56,480
man i said i got some killer weed this

2575
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:58,158
was the company that i got it from

2576
01:25:56,479 --> 01:25:59,919
and what happens is

2577
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:02,000
those companies only produce certain

2578
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,760
amounts so say justin's farm does 500

2579
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,079
pounds and we just talked about a farm

2580
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:08,000
that's going to do 200 000

2581
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:09,920
well what happens is why can't you do

2582
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,319
pre-buys because we do that with other

2583
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,000
products i'm in wine clubs i order wine

2584
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:15,920
in and hold it and and there's other

2585
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,840
things in life that we that we work with

2586
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,000
i call it the ferrari model because the

2587
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:22,480
ferrari model is you got 300 orders for

2588
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,719
cars and you only made 200 of them and

2589
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:26,638
the other 100 guys sorry you missed out

2590
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,800
and it doesn't seem to hurt ferrari very

2591
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:31,039
badly what it does is they've created a

2592
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,360
demand for a thing that makes people

2593
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:35,439
want a thing and it makes them commit to

2594
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:38,079
this thing and it allows you then to

2595
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:39,839
sell that thing at a higher price point

2596
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:41,198
and have an ability to sell all your

2597
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,319
product i think a lot of these craft

2598
01:26:41,198 --> 01:26:43,678
farms i don't think they should even be

2599
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:46,000
putting them in eighths i think there

2600
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,800
should be an ounce only so what you were

2601
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,479
saying about bud tenders

2602
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,400
so we have like three separate projects

2603
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:54,479
now in oregon because we're realizing

2604
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:55,920
the truth of what you said

2605
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:59,198
we have like three separate projects now

2606
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,800
in oregon to educate bud tenders

2607
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:03,359
like these people are putting together

2608
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,039
like reams of educational content and

2609
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,519
doing blood tender certifications so

2610
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:09,279
that because

2611
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,360
we are super dependent on those guys

2612
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:13,198
they're the gatekeepers

2613
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:16,000
and and reaching out to them and getting

2614
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:18,000
them to drive the market in a new way

2615
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,960
that that's the easiest pressure point

2616
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,880
right now

2617
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,319
and we got to do that we should all be

2618
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,639
pulling behind that like making sure

2619
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:26,880
that the brand is carried into the shop

2620
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,400
the bud tender understands the brand can

2621
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,840
talk about it could talk about the

2622
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:31,519
different varieties

2623
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,760
and when someone comes in

2624
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,199
they steer them towards something more

2625
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,960
intelligent and then the market will

2626
01:27:35,198 --> 01:27:38,399
evolve it's tough for a lot of the

2627
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,480
stores though because you got like i use

2628
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:42,559
an example of some stores i go to they

2629
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:44,079
got 400 flower choices

2630
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,840
well jesus christ how does any bud tend

2631
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:47,840
to know 400 goddamn choices well that's

2632
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,920
like no no for real for real like the

2633
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,920
why do they carry so much flour because

2634
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:55,279
because ultimately they they believe

2635
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:57,359
that that varietal is is needed in terms

2636
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:58,639
of um who's coming and they want to

2637
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:00,880
catch everybody because it's so

2638
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:02,719
competitive and if you're really doing

2639
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,159
legit business with your facilities

2640
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:06,000
where you're permitted you know

2641
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:07,599
basically you're if you're breaking even

2642
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,279
you're doing pretty goddamn good now to

2643
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,480
me this whole model is an assimilation

2644
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:12,319
model where you're building something to

2645
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:13,678
be sold in a couple years this isn't

2646
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:15,439
about running a business like

2647
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:16,960
traditional business where i make x

2648
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:18,960
amount of money i have x amount of

2649
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,960
profit we move forward most of these

2650
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,039
places are being built on a for-sale

2651
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:25,039
basis where you're building some kind of

2652
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:26,880
vehicle that you can unload to a logic

2653
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:28,800
conglomerate down the road

2654
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,560
it favors that model if you take a look

2655
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,400
at it to me it's walmart model it's it's

2656
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,840
couple percentage points of profit and

2657
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:34,960
if you can deal with it you're going to

2658
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,000
do great but if you're not you're

2659
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,439
screwed

2660
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,920
and so they're trying to shotgun

2661
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:41,359
approach who they're selling to and i

2662
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,920
think what you have to have is you have

2663
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:46,639
to have the ability for storefronts

2664
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:50,000
in specific areas to say you know where

2665
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:52,480
we're mendocino based where you have a

2666
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,880
shop in venice that works off of

2667
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:56,479
mendocino farmers specifically and what

2668
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,480
it does it allows them to or the

2669
01:28:56,479 --> 01:29:00,718
appalachian farmers where these three

2670
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:03,039
appalachians we believe have superior

2671
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,960
product of these products and of those

2672
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:06,960
appalachian farmers we believe these

2673
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,158
three farmers have the right product of

2674
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,158
this product

2675
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:12,559
so what you hear about appalachian about

2676
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:14,158
collectives trying to get retail right

2677
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:16,400
yeah you have a you'll have some kind of

2678
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:18,319
humble collective that has a shop in l.a

2679
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:19,920
right and it's like an embassy

2680
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:21,359
exactly that allows you

2681
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,279
and then you bring a brand ambassador

2682
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:25,359
down someone who's able to sit there and

2683
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:26,800
educate the people on hey these are how

2684
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:28,559
they produce it these are the different

2685
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,159
directions and a lot of it is trying to

2686
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,679
get people to experience some of it and

2687
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:33,599
i think i think one of the one of the

2688
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:35,440
the tricks of it is is you do steam

2689
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,960
derived terps and you put it in a water

2690
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:37,919
bottle because that's the only way

2691
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,079
you're going to get anybody to taste

2692
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,520
this shit legally and so we messed

2693
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:43,359
around with it where we steam pulled

2694
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,679
terps off the varietals put it into a

2695
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:48,158
water bottle that's legal now you can

2696
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:50,800
taste what that variety tastes like with

2697
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:52,479
no legal issues and just just to let you

2698
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,840
know also that you know what we're doing

2699
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:55,439
right now what we've evolved from the

2700
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:57,440
events not being able to happen this

2701
01:29:55,439 --> 01:29:59,599
year is we've made something called an

2702
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:01,519
outpost right so we put all the brands

2703
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,760
in like a kiosk and have the brand

2704
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,520
ambassadors come down and actually like

2705
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,039
do education pieces

2706
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,840
but even that because the distributors

2707
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:13,359
have just the distributor model too the

2708
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:15,039
distributors are you know 200 500 skus

2709
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:16,399
right they go into the shop and they're

2710
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:17,679
looking at all these skus they've got

2711
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:19,839
these price sheets got everything like

2712
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:21,520
that and i went across the street across

2713
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,199
the street is the e's headquarters i

2714
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,440
guess heard of ease right right right

2715
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:27,599
across the street that big giant castle

2716
01:30:25,439 --> 01:30:29,759
is is ease and um and i went in there

2717
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,920
with a bunch of farm product little farm

2718
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,960
box those super cute little stamps and

2719
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:37,119
and all the humble magazine appellations

2720
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,719
map you know like hi

2721
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:40,479
you know you want to buy our weed and

2722
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:42,319
they were like we're buying six dollar

2723
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:45,119
eights

2724
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:48,399
it's like well i was like oh shit that's

2725
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:50,639
like 300 that's like 300 pounds unless

2726
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:52,799
with taxes and and distro and all those

2727
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:54,000
things so it's like so price

2728
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,239
right is driving because these people

2729
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,039
are trying to push it all out so it it's

2730
01:30:56,238 --> 01:30:58,799
like

2731
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:01,359
we're we're up against

2732
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:04,239
like this market is going the price per

2733
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:05,920
per unit is going down right that's

2734
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:07,439
driving a lot of the business inside the

2735
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,440
retail the retailers are trying to push

2736
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:11,039
this out you know so it's like it's

2737
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:13,198
about education but it's about each and

2738
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:16,000
every single one of you going in and

2739

demanding higher quality products it's

2740
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,439
about us

2741
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:22,479
it's about us defining those quality

2742
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:24,000
markers like we have to we have to like

2743
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:25,039
you know friendships like with the hash

2744
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,800
wheel

2745
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:28,079
max mantra so give him a shout out you

2746
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,560
know with the with the interpreting

2747
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:32,559
guide you know it's like and you know

2748
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,480
tim blake for the love of christ put

2749
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,639
pressure on tim blake to release the cup

2750
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:38,399
data you know of all the of all the of

2751
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:40,239
all the of all the you know the the

2752
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:42,799
judging cards

2753
01:31:40,238 --> 01:31:45,119
all of those markers we start speaking

2754
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:47,360
that language and unification like every

2755
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:48,319
single one of us we can demand bud

2756
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:50,960
tenders

2757
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:53,119
to actually give us a higher quality

2758
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,800
product and brands to produce that

2759
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:56,800
higher quality product

2760
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:59,119
you just got to get the the problem with

2761
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,639
that the is that you're if you really

2762
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:02,559
want a good bud tender the best blood

2763
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:03,679
tender is really the grower

2764
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,560
because they're the ones that know the

2765
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:08,960
product best and so it's trying to get

2766
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,840
the the level of information to the end

2767
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:12,960
user and you have to target it

2768
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:15,199
geographically where you go for all the

2769
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:17,039
years that i did you know illicit uh

2770
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:19,839
sales for nursery work

2771
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:21,519
um when people ask me uh that's where

2772
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,800
that's where senator mcguire came in he

2773
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,239
came and asked me he goes how do you

2774
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,239
choose you for riles and i said you want

2775
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,839
the answer i tell you you want the other

2776
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:29,439
one the real answer and he goes i want

2777
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,719
the real answer i said i take a look

2778
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:32,158
regionally and i take a look through the

2779
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:34,639
whole united states and i determine

2780
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:36,879
what's moving in the u.s and i study the

2781
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:39,039
us as a total market

2782
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,719
and then when you come in to do business

2783
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:42,399
with me i ask you privately where you

2784
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:44,000
move in the weed and if you tell me

2785
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:45,599
you're moving it to chicago i know what

2786
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,279
to put you into if you're moving into

2787
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,560
florida i know what to put you into i

2788
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:50,479
know what to put you into because

2789
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,760
regions have desires

2790
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:52,879
and i think with cannabis what you're

2791
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,480
doing is we're throwing and there's

2792
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:56,239
something wrong with us people that have

2793
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:58,158
lower income levels shouldn't be forced

2794
01:32:56,238 --> 01:33:00,559
to buy more expensive cannabis because

2795
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:02,960
we want to get paid a fair price for it

2796
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,360
because in every object in life you can

2797
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,119
find a price price gradient and i think

2798
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:08,479
that what we have to do is really steer

2799
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:10,158
ourselves into people that are more

2800
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:12,319
discerning and so that's why i believe

2801
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:13,599
that when you work off of these craft

2802
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:14,960
models

2803
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,639
less is more

2804
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,239
and you get a higher price because

2805
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:19,840
you're trying to target a very different

2806
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:21,759
user you're not trying to get everybody

2807
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,600
in the country to smoke your weed you're

2808
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,600
trying to get people that really have

2809
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:28,079
enough income to smoke a higher quality

2810
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:30,320
product and we don't have enough

2811
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:32,559
price differentiation at all not right

2812
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:34,880
now it's all in the same bucket like

2813
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,440
there's like 1000x

2814
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:39,279
range right

2815
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:41,359
and with cannabis like we just haven't

2816
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:42,719
figured out how to walk in

2817
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:45,439
we haven't figured out how to walk into

2818
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:45,439
a store and be like

2819
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:50,479
this is a 200.8

2820
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:52,319
because it's fucking worth it like

2821
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:55,439
in every other

2822
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:57,439
product it's like that we just haven't

2823
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:59,439
we haven't the balls maybe yet to just

2824
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:01,759
to just set up a store and to grow in a

2825
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:03,119
supply chain and just be like this is so

2826
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,760
much better

2827
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:07,359
it's not the delivery funding to to

2828
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:09,119
actually do it because at the end of the

2829
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:10,719
day it's the education but at the end of

2830
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:12,479
the day i did the math when you and i

2831
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:14,079
used to work together i remember the

2832
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:16,479
most money i ever made was when you the

2833
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:18,319
ogsd right i felt greenhouse for the

2834
01:34:16,479 --> 01:34:20,399
ogsd it had worked in two different

2835
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:22,479
markets i got to clear it out but when i

2836
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:23,439
went with the diamonds with the diamond

2837
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:26,399
og

2838
01:34:23,439 --> 01:34:28,399
i i got a third of what it was that i

2839
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:29,920
was doing so i was like so i had to grow

2840
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:31,920
that ogsd

2841
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:34,319
because i could sell it

2842
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:36,079
it would it would move it wasn't exactly

2843
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:38,399
you know it wasn't a desired trade but

2844
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:39,519
it would move as in the fuel market and

2845
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:41,519
i could grow

2846
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:44,080
three times as much of it so it was like

2847
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:46,080
so it's like we we were we're economic

2848
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:48,479
we're driven by economics as well it's

2849
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:50,238
like what produces the most and and and

2850
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:53,039
i know but it's the job of the small

2851
01:34:50,238 --> 01:34:55,198
grower to to its will be to grow the

2852
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:57,439
stuff that doesn't produce the most but

2853
01:34:55,198 --> 01:34:59,198
is extraordinary and you can

2854
01:34:57,439 --> 01:35:00,719
you're getting that kind of price reward

2855
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:02,000
right yeah back then of course the

2856
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:03,600
prohibition model that's what it is

2857
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,279
we're just not coming out of that fast

2858
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:06,880
enough you know well it's going to it's

2859
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:08,238
going to take time though wine people

2860
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:10,560
had to drink it or they would have died

2861
01:35:08,238 --> 01:35:12,158
of uh toxic water so i mean fermented

2862
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:13,600
drinks being christ was beer was a

2863
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:14,559
breakfast drink

2864
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,320
and so

2865
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,000
it could still be a breakfast yeah still

2866
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:20,000
is but the but the point of it is is

2867
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,118
that you you you have to be able to take

2868
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,560
the time and that's the problem is that

2869
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:24,000
we don't have time or you don't feel

2870
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:26,159
like we have time

2871
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
but i know that as people start to

2872
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:29,279
become exposed to cannabis and you start

2873
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,639
to buy these cheaper products you're

2874
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:32,559
going to say hey how come that wasn't

2875
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:33,760
the stuff i used to smoke prior and

2876
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,600
you're going to desire it you're going

2877
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:37,119
to realize you know what i could smoke

2878
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,520
an ounce of this shit and it wouldn't be

2879
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:40,880
as satisfying as an eighth of the other

2880
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,679
so therefore what's the difference in

2881
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,520
price

2882
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:45,840
it's like all things you you drink in

2883
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,280
certain amount that's not a budweiser

2884
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:50,000
you gotta you got some kind of little

2885
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:51,599
micro ipa in front of you it's it's it's

2886
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,279
a choice that was made a little devil

2887
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,039
had on it this guy's interesting kevin

2888
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:57,840
we got we got an audience we got

2889
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:57,840
questions i'm sorry

2890
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:01,839
hey guys thank you so much for coming

2891
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,600
through you guys are all super

2892
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:05,199
knowledgeable you know giving us all a

2893
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,679
ton of stuff um i have a question on

2894
01:36:05,198 --> 01:36:09,439
consumers you guys are not you guys you

2895
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:12,079
specifically kevin seem to be mixed on

2896
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:13,839
consumer because um

2897
01:36:12,079 --> 01:36:15,359
you seem to say that the bud tender has

2898
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:17,119
a ton of power but at the same time

2899
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:18,880
you're saying that they go home and and

2900
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:20,399
they decide so at the end of the day

2901
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,079
don't you think that the consumer is

2902
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:23,679
going to know what they want they might

2903
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:25,920
be pushed something but just because

2904
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,359
there's a hottie in a hornidos you know

2905
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:30,000
cut off doesn't mean i'm going to order

2906
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:32,000
hornitos tequila no it's not a hottie in

2907
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,920
a horninos it's that when you're when

2908
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,840
you're running a storefront it isn't

2909
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:38,560
everybody that comes in is so cognizant

2910
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:40,639
of what they want so most of the time

2911
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:42,560
people ask what do you have can you

2912
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:44,639
recommend me something and what they

2913
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:47,360
recommend typically is something that

2914
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:49,760
they have a connection to in some form

2915
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:52,079
so if you're a good farmer in terms of

2916
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:53,520
business skill you make a relationship

2917
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:54,559
with the people who are selling your

2918
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,719
product and that's where this

2919
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:58,000
distributor model sucks in my opinion

2920
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:00,399
because they're just sticking this shit

2921
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,319
in a shelf the farmer has to actually go

2922
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:04,479
to the bud tenders show them the

2923
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:07,039
products that they cultivate tell them

2924
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:08,718
why they they grow what they grow give

2925
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:10,479
them the information about what makes it

2926
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:12,719
different let them experience it in some

2927
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:14,879
capacity because now what the blood

2928
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:16,480
tender has is it is a memory of that

2929
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:18,880
relationship when i walk into stores

2930
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:20,238
that have hundreds of choices i go give

2931
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,760
me something gassy give me something

2932
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:23,039
fruity and give me something you like

2933
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,800
and they go okay

2934
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:26,399
this gassy one is what seems to be

2935
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,800
moving most we seem to get the most

2936
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:30,879
satisfaction on the on the repeat buy

2937
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,560
and then this is the same for the fuel

2938
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,920
so what we're doing is i'm asking them

2939
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,600
and this is a game i'm playing i'm just

2940
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:37,118
playing to see how are they choosing

2941
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,119
these things and then the final one is

2942
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:41,118
what do you like yourself what would you

2943
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:42,719
choose yourself for your own opinion

2944
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:44,238
your own piece

2945
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:45,840
because then it lets me get an idea what

2946
01:37:44,238 --> 01:37:47,439
the individual likes

2947
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:49,679
and so it's

2948
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:52,238
it's this person who's selling the

2949
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:54,158
product at the front of the counter

2950
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:56,799
you have to be able to differentiate

2951
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:59,519
yourself as a farmer grower whatever you

2952
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,480
want to call yourself to that individual

2953
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,239
because

2954
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:04,479
otherwise you just fit into a jar like

2955
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:06,799
all the others and that's the part that

2956
01:38:04,479 --> 01:38:08,718
matters is that in any single storefront

2957
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,639
you walk into it's the person who's

2958
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:12,480
being paid the least amount of money who

2959
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:14,719
has the most amount of influence on the

2960
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:16,399
sale of your product i mean in oregon

2961
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:18,079
the consumers don't know what they want

2962
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:20,000
people keep saying that but do you think

2963
01:38:18,079 --> 01:38:21,519
they'll learn is my question they'll

2964
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,359
learn if the bud tenders teach them

2965
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:25,840
through education the bud tenders can

2966
01:38:23,359 --> 01:38:25,839
teach them

2967
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:30,000
yes the farmer has to teach the blood

2968
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:32,158
tender though really about why the

2969
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,520
product is different because it can't be

2970
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:34,719
the distributor because the distributor

2971
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,920
how the hell they're gonna know 700

2972
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:37,760
products they don't even smoke half

2973
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,760
these guys don't even smoke weed

2974
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:42,000
so it it it's it's you're letting people

2975
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:43,440
don't even smoke weed dictate your

2976
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,039
success or your business but that's why

2977
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:46,559
i tell the farmers listen you got to go

2978
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:48,079
to every dispensary

2979
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,960
don't go through the distributor in the

2980
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:52,880
conventional sense go to the stores make

2981
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:55,359
the connections as the farmer and then

2982
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:58,000
find a distributor to sell to them so

2983
01:38:55,359 --> 01:38:59,839
the consumers who like pinot noir

2984
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,039
or sold pinot noir at a certain point is

2985
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,199
that what you're saying because i'm

2986
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:05,039
asking they know they like pinot noir

2987
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:07,279
from trying it from learning from

2988
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:08,560
experimenting not because they walked in

2989
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:10,479
and the hornitos chick gave them

2990
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,960
hornidos and that's what they're about

2991
01:39:10,479 --> 01:39:12,959
but but a

2992
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:17,599
partially both

2993
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,279
some people know that they tried it and

2994
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,360
liked it someplace they come in and ask

2995
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:23,198
for it but a tremendous number of people

2996
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:25,439
come in and ask to ask the person

2997
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:27,198
selling it what do you recommend i have

2998
01:39:25,439 --> 01:39:29,359
20 choices in front of me what's your

2999
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:31,118
opinion the bud tenders in oregon say

3000
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:33,439
that it's like being a bartender in a

3001
01:39:31,118 --> 01:39:35,118
bar and every single person who comes in

3002
01:39:33,439 --> 01:39:36,960
says

3003
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:38,079
what should i drink bars aren't like

3004
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,840
that anymore

3005
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:41,198
but for now though but for now i'm lucky

3006
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,319
to have a difference

3007
01:39:41,198 --> 01:39:43,919
right because

3008
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:46,399
we're looking we give out i think we

3009
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:48,000
give out 50 to 100 dispensary comps

3010
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:49,839
mostly to bud tenders to emerald

3011
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,319
exchange events to come and meet the

3012
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,239
farmers and then we're we're non-stop

3013
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:56,238
giving samples we're like if we find out

3014
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:57,439
you're a bud tender we're like

3015
01:39:56,238 --> 01:39:59,279
we're you know we're hanging out with

3016
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:01,678
you i have a different experience with

3017
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:04,319
bud tenders when i'm walking in you know

3018
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:05,920
to to a space i'm usually with a brand

3019
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:09,039
or or doing something different so it's

3020
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:11,359
like it's education to me to see now in

3021
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:13,519
the la market when i you know

3022
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:16,000
watching how many products are coming

3023
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:18,560
out how many products are available and

3024
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,960
how important it is that we do

3025
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,800
ask for what it is that we want like as

3026
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:25,679
consumers so media

3027
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:27,679
is becoming huge so the media outlets

3028
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:30,399
partnerships with media telling people

3029
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:31,679
the story of the strains that we want

3030
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:33,359
and i know that that's one of the things

3031
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:36,639
that you know i've noticed when being in

3032
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:38,158
the la marketplace is like hey how is it

3033
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:40,480
that we get what it is that we want

3034
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:42,638
right what what how does it we ask these

3035
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:43,599
questions and the bud tinder seem to be

3036
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:45,760
to me

3037
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,800
more educated than what you guys like

3038
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:48,000
and i don't know i'm just coming from a

3039
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,920
different place maybe it's coming from

3040
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,039
the emerald exchange place but i think

3041
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,719
that

3042
01:40:51,039 --> 01:40:54,880
i i don't know like

3043
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:56,880
i just see a different

3044
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,800
view vantage point i mean i think that

3045
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:01,600
they're i think that we are starting to

3046
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,039
find people that are like oh it's

3047
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:06,000
beginning yeah yeah

3048
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:07,279
it's beginning but it's it's not to the

3049
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,439
point where

3050
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:11,359
you have an ability for the customer to

3051
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:12,879
know exactly what they like what you

3052
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:14,799
what they what they can tell you though

3053
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:17,199
is how they want to feel what kind of

3054
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:19,119
effect do they want to achieve from the

3055
01:41:17,198 --> 01:41:20,479
product that they're buying so they can

3056
01:41:19,118 --> 01:41:22,238
tell you hey i want something that makes

3057
01:41:20,479 --> 01:41:24,158
me feel uplifted i would like something

3058
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:27,359
to relax me i want to have some sleep

3059
01:41:24,158 --> 01:41:28,158
aid i'm hungry i'd like to be able to

3060
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:31,198
have

3061
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:33,359
a appetite stimulation either up or down

3062
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:35,118
so they can tell you this information

3063
01:41:33,359 --> 01:41:36,799
but for so many individuals they used to

3064
01:41:35,118 --> 01:41:38,319
score and we just scoring weed and half

3065
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,920
the stuff that they were buying was

3066
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:41,679
mislabeled that's what philos lets you

3067
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,880
find out half the stuff you were smoking

3068
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,800
really wasn't what you thought you were

3069
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:46,719
smoking and still isn't

3070
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,000
and still isn't done

3071
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:51,039
so when you go in and you talk to your

3072
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,399
bud tender you're buying a blue dream

3073
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:53,920
you don't have any idea whether that's

3074
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:56,638
blue dream and your butt tender doesn't

3075
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,319
either i mean and so so part of the but

3076
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:59,840
if there was a really smart abundance

3077
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:01,439
who had smoked that stuff right

3078
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,560
thoughtfully and it was called blue

3079
01:42:01,439 --> 01:42:04,319
dream but he was like this is what you

3080
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:06,560
want now i know that after talking to

3081
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:08,559
you and it was called blue dream

3082
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:10,480
right i mean i shouldn't say this but

3083
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:12,239
if there was that connection that'd be

3084
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:14,158
just fine you could have a contender who

3085
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:15,519
could lead you i agree and one of the

3086
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:17,279
ways they get there i think is because

3087
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:18,960
they'll have a certification

3088
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:20,559
by your company and they'll start to

3089
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,600
know without having to smoke at some

3090
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,840
point so there are seven or eight

3091
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,840
different kinds of you know people

3092
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,560
we know it but most people don't know

3093
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:30,560
kush they don't know that afghan was was

3094
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,560
was for you know making hash and so it

3095
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:34,000
gives you a different kind of high most

3096
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,679
people don't know that now i'm a member

3097
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,679
of the garden writers of america we

3098
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:40,399
represent we reach

3099
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:41,279
85 million people a week

3100
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:43,679
so

3101
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:45,519
last year was the first time they ever

3102
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:47,920
had a talk on cannabis they would never

3103
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:50,159
let anybody talk about cannabis so there

3104
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:52,000
are no newspaper articles by regular

3105
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:54,079
garden writers and you know who would

3106
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,399
reach normal people yeah you got the

3107
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:58,238
oregonian has their you know their bud

3108
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:59,359
tender page and everything else but you

3109
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:01,519
know where they try to make it sound

3110
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:03,839
like it's a wine and blah blah blah but

3111
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,520
that's not the right kind of education

3112
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,480
that we need right now we've got people

3113
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,400
that are

3114
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:10,319
they want to smoke the weed they really

3115
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:12,319
don't even know what to ask other than

3116
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:14,000
yeah i want to be uplifted or you know a

3117
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:17,039
couch locked that's the two things they

3118
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,399
know and and so all of this stuff has to

3119
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:21,118
change and one of the ways i think we

3120
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:22,399
change is by not wasting our time so for

3121
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:25,039
example

3122
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:28,559
we have this 420 day which gets more

3123
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:29,760
publicity than you can possibly garner

3124
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,480
for free

3125
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:35,440
for the industry what do we do on 420 we

3126
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:37,439
party you know we could use 420 day to

3127
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:39,759
change the name from marijuana to

3128
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:42,158
cannabis we could we could find three or

3129
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:44,560
four different things you know

3130
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:46,479
420 today everybody who who's thinking

3131
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:48,719
about smoking cannabis or to read this

3132
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:50,319
article or this week there's a way we

3133
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:52,639
could unify

3134
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:54,639
the way to reach people as an industry

3135
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:56,079
jeff we talk to ourselves we don't

3136
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:57,440
really get the people who are out of the

3137
01:43:56,079 --> 01:43:59,840
industry

3138
01:43:57,439 --> 01:44:03,919
did you say that the garden writers of

3139
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:08,560
america reach 85 million people a week

3140
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:10,480
really on tv radio that's awesome 85

3141
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:12,800
million people a week

3142
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:14,238
and so i go you're the new outlet for

3143
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,159
the cannabis industry i'm gonna be

3144
01:44:14,238 --> 01:44:17,678
leaning on you heavily you're right

3145
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:21,039
except we've got another problem there

3146
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:23,199
so so so high times decides

3147
01:44:21,039 --> 01:44:24,319
dope magazine maybe we better buy that

3148
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:27,359
we're going to see the same kind of

3149
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:29,198
consolidation in the media industry

3150
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:31,839
involving this you know we've got about

3151
01:44:29,198 --> 01:44:33,599
100 different cannabis magazines now

3152
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,960
they're all the same you know but at

3153
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,480
least we got 100 different ones they

3154
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:38,158
could be different

3155
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:41,279
and and you know now we're going to end

3156
01:44:38,158 --> 01:44:42,719
up with two or three and so but yeah

3157
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:45,519
these are the things we have to do but i

3158
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:48,560
want to go back to that 420 idea it is a

3159
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:50,159
day that's there it is written about in

3160
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:53,520
every newspaper it is on every

3161
01:44:50,158 --> 01:44:55,920
television station 4 20 oh my god what

3162
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,679
an opportunity for us and we blow it

3163
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,880
every year well we're just all really

3164
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:01,279
excited

3165
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:04,000
today well all right we should figure

3166
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:05,118
out what to do ten more questions so

3167
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,960

the light i'm the only dark guy here

3174
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,600

3175
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:24,158
of the lighting no no it's okay

3176

thank you mowgli i appreciate that

3177
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:27,439
um

3178
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:29,759
so i'm very new to the industry and and

3179
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:32,399
first i want to say thank you guys for

3180
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:34,480
sharing your wisdom with us

3181
01:45:32,399 --> 01:45:36,399
there seems to be for me

3182
01:45:34,479 --> 01:45:38,000
a different

3183
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:39,679
pivot point

3184
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,158
it's a plant

3185
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:44,880
it's a living plant

3186
01:45:42,158 --> 01:45:46,000
it seems to me and when we talk about

3187
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,440
numbers

3188
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,679
high th

3189
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:51,439
every plant it seems to me from what i'm

3190
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:54,399
learning

3191
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:56,399
every strain is different everybody that

3192
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:58,559
smokes it takes it

3193
01:45:56,399 --> 01:46:00,638
because we're all individuals have

3194
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:03,039
different effects with it

3195
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:04,639
and so to have a discussion on one

3196
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:05,600
particular one and how you like it don't

3197
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:08,159
like it

3198
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,600
is one thing the other and as good as a

3199
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:11,198
question here

3200
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:13,280
the other thing is that

3201
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:14,960
the medicinal part of this

3202
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:16,880
no matter whether you're a wreck whether

3203
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,760
or not it's still a medicine in the

3204
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:22,079
sense that whether it's a health

3205
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:24,159
or whether it's a physical ailment

3206
01:46:22,079 --> 01:46:26,800
it's a medicine right and we know that

3207
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:27,920
i'm from india and i know my ancestors

3208
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,800
have been using it in fact my

3209
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:33,279
grandfather as well for a long time

3210
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:35,920
so what i see also from the outside is a

3211
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:37,759
lot of camaraderie that happens

3212
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:38,840
and a whole lot of

3213
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:40,719
less amount of

3214
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,560
collaboration not only in the

3215
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:44,719
educational part of this

3216
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:48,080
but also treating that plant

3217
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:49,760
like it should be in the sense of

3218
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:51,039
nature how nature is

3219
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:52,960
well i guess what i'm trying to figure

3220
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:55,359
out and from you guys is

3221
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:57,439
you talk about pricing

3222
01:46:55,359 --> 01:47:00,000
you talk about keeping

3223
01:46:57,439 --> 01:47:01,919
that edge in the marketplace and mobley

3224
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,079
i hear you very loud and clear

3225
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:06,000
you've got to make that plant very

3226
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:08,639
quality that people will come the

3227
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,238
growers that have used i i'm not just

3228
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:12,159
trying to plug the plasma lake but

3229
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:14,959
they've kept their price up in oregon

3230
01:47:12,158 --> 01:47:17,439
because they can do and get the numbers

3231
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:18,560
and get full entourage effect full

3232
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:20,638
profile

3233
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:23,039
so what i'm asking i guess is

3234
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:25,760
when you go indoors like this

3235
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:26,639
trying to do biomimicry trying to do

3236
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:28,880
that

3237
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:31,359
and get the full expression of those

3238
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:32,960
specific land races you're trying to go

3239
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:34,238
back to

3240
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:36,000
what is the process that you're

3241
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:38,399
currently using to do that and is

3242
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,840
everybody doing it like in a vacuum and

3243
01:47:38,399 --> 01:47:42,479
then trying to figure it out so they can

3244
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:44,800
get an edge or is there a group that's

3245
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:46,718
literally working towards

3246
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:49,119
getting more of the same kinds of

3247
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:50,719
medicine out to everybody that really

3248
01:47:49,118 --> 01:47:52,880
need this medicine

3249
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:53,679
not just i mean i smoke don't get me

3250
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,520
wrong

3251
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:57,359
i enjoy it too

3252
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,199
but you know what i can just get it from

3253
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:00,559
my grower the guys i know so i can

3254
01:47:59,198 --> 01:48:02,960
supply myself

3255
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:04,960
but the medicinal kind of grow

3256
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:07,039
the kind that really are helping

3257
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:08,480
veterans out because of cancer patients

3258
01:48:07,039 --> 01:48:10,079
and all these

3259
01:48:08,479 --> 01:48:11,839
where's the group

3260
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:14,079
that actually

3261
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,000
does that as a collaboration and how do

3262
01:48:14,079 --> 01:48:19,118
you guys think that should be done

3263
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,479
that's my question i think traditionally

3264
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:22,799
that's been done

3265
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:25,759
by a lot of us

3266
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:27,440
behind the scenes because you're

3267
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,280
when you're talking about medicine to

3268
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:30,479
veterans and ill and stuff like that

3269
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:32,559
they're broke

3270
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:34,718
and so you know from my situation that's

3271
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:37,440
why i've given out so much freaking

3272
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:39,920
money because how do you how do you ask

3273
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:41,279
somebody who's has nothing to give you

3274
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:43,039
something

3275
01:48:41,279 --> 01:48:44,800
and so you're you're that's a that's a

3276
01:48:43,039 --> 01:48:47,519
charity situation which is very

3277
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:50,079
difficult for for regular people to do

3278
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:53,199
because it's you having to subsidize it

3279
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:55,039
yeah but that's that's you kevin

3280
01:48:53,198 --> 01:48:56,319
but you know so so now there's companies

3281
01:48:55,039 --> 01:48:57,279
right that are trying to do that they're

3282
01:48:56,319 --> 01:48:59,039
trying to

3283
01:48:57,279 --> 01:49:01,519
make medicine you know they're trying to

3284
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:03,920
have proprietary plants that have

3285
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:05,679
unusual cannabinoids and they make oil

3286
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:07,760
from it and they work with doctors and

3287
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:09,279
they try to bring it to patients

3288
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,800
and

3289
01:49:09,279 --> 01:49:12,559
and it's it's rough to watch them

3290
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,320
because they they're they're trying to

3291
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,000
help patients and they're also

3292
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:16,960
simultaneously trying to build all this

3293
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,719
ip

3294
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:20,399
and they're conflicted in various ways

3295
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:22,719
and they don't have any data on the

3296
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:24,960
actual medicine they're giving patients

3297
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:26,639
and it's not a collaborative thing

3298
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:29,118
it's a handful of companies that are

3299
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:31,279
very focused on the medical space

3300
01:49:29,118 --> 01:49:31,279
and

3301
01:49:31,359 --> 01:49:34,639
it's it's not like it should be that's

3302
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:36,319
that's big business though the medical

3303
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:37,840
end is the money yeah no but you know

3304
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:39,519
that when you're talking about how do

3305
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:41,119
you help you it wasn't about how do you

3306
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,480
drive medical you said how do you help

3307
01:49:41,118 --> 01:49:44,559
specific groups

3308
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:46,959
when you say the word help that doesn't

3309
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:49,119
mean charge help is help is like come

3310
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:50,000
over and help me if i pay you that's a

3311
01:49:49,118 --> 01:49:52,158
job

3312
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,639
and so when you're talking about help

3313
01:49:52,158 --> 01:49:56,399
then then it has to be where

3314
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:58,800
when we had ideas where you had these

3315
01:49:56,399 --> 01:50:00,238
regions like our regions where x amount

3316
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:03,599
of the product that came off of your

3317
01:50:00,238 --> 01:50:05,519
farm was put into a a general fund

3318
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:07,360
and it was allowed to be distributed so

3319
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:09,760
that you only had x so you know if you

3320
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:11,679
did 90 of the crop was for sales so that

3321
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:13,599
you could keep your farm alive and then

3322
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:15,279
10 of the farm was given to these type

3323
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:16,639
of situations

3324
01:50:15,279 --> 01:50:17,599
then you'd have some ability it's just

3325
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:19,679
that it's tough because you've got to

3326
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:21,440
pay tax on these products you can't just

3327
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:23,118
give anything away anymore so none of

3328
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:24,719
this stuff is easily to give away you

3329
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:26,479
got to pay all the taxes on it the

3330
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:29,760
excise tax you got to pay production

3331
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:32,399
costs so it's extremely expensive to do

3332
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:34,560
what you're saying in the modern world

3333
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:36,799
we went at this as aggressively as

3334
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:38,960
possible while we had the chance but

3335
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:40,159
i think that until you're able to create

3336
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:42,880
these

3337
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:45,598
uh larger operations that can get some

3338
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:47,118
of the prices down on genomically sorted

3339
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:49,119
medical varieties on how we want to

3340
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:51,198
define medical say it's in a specific

3341
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:53,198
direction i don't use the word medical

3342
01:50:51,198 --> 01:50:55,279
variety very often i think it's it's all

3343
01:50:53,198 --> 01:50:57,598
cannabis it's how you use it

3344
01:50:55,279 --> 01:50:59,359
and so the i think the problem is that

3345
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:01,360
when it comes to these lower income

3346
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:03,118
people i i don't think america really

3347
01:51:01,359 --> 01:51:05,598
gives a shit because i had a step over

3348
01:51:03,118 --> 01:51:07,118
three homeless to get in here so when i

3349
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:09,119
see homeless laying in the street i

3350
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:11,118
don't think people really weren't about

3351
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:13,279
providing cannabis to people

3352
01:51:11,118 --> 01:51:14,479
and we were caught up in it because we

3353
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:16,238
were

3354
01:51:14,479 --> 01:51:18,158
we were caught up in it because we were

3355
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:20,158
just sensitized to it because these are

3356
01:51:18,158 --> 01:51:21,598
people that you're around you see your

3357
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:23,198
neighbors that need help so all of a

3358
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:24,719
sudden it starts to make you more aware

3359
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:26,559
then you have strangers come to you for

3360
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,920
help and it makes you more aware but

3361
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,920
we're in corporate cannabis in

3362
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:32,079
california this is this is a different

3363
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:34,719
animal kevin i give i give weed to

3364
01:51:32,079 --> 01:51:36,399
everybody out here on the street you do

3365
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:38,480
oh hell yeah all right that's why the

3366
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:40,319
guy was lying on the ground

3367
01:51:38,479 --> 01:51:42,559
lying on the ground no i mean we've

3368
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:44,639
actually had weed church which is really

3369
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:46,080
cool we're like on sunday like we like

3370
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:47,199
sat down and we're just sitting there we

3371
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:49,118
smoked a joint and the next thing you

3372
01:51:47,198 --> 01:51:51,598
know we're drawing mandalas on the road

3373
01:51:49,118 --> 01:51:53,519
inside but but but i definitely like

3374
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:55,199
it's uh that's a hundred that's so good

3375
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,560
we don't know well my ex-wife used to

3376
01:51:55,198 --> 01:51:58,479
say like i was the only person that

3377
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:00,400
could because dr courtney gave me an ac

3378
01:51:58,479 --> 01:52:02,479
dc strain and i got it through jew

3379
01:52:00,399 --> 01:52:04,000
tillman and then all of a sudden i got

3380
01:52:02,479 --> 01:52:05,439
their phone numbers and everybody was

3381
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,479
giving me the phone numbers they or they

3382
01:52:05,439 --> 01:52:08,799
gave

3383
01:52:06,479 --> 01:52:10,479
their my number to everyone else and my

3384
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,159
ex-wife was like dude you figured out

3385
01:52:10,479 --> 01:52:14,879
how to turn our square footage into a

3386
01:52:12,158 --> 01:52:16,960
non-profit and i was like you know

3387
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:18,639
because at the end of the day how do you

3388
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:19,840
charge it's not just veterans because if

3389
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:22,000
you want to do veterans i mean the

3390
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:24,239
compassion programs that we're you know

3391
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,679
supporting through cga and wheat the

3392
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:27,519
weed for warriors program that's

3393
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:29,199
extremely important to support that at

3394
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:30,880
any cost i mean that the compassion

3395
01:52:29,198 --> 01:52:32,638
programs to stay alive the way it was

3396
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:35,279
written in the state we just got the new

3397
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:37,520
regs dropped we're allowed now to to

3398
01:52:35,279 --> 01:52:39,599
have to sign it we're now allowed to

3399
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:41,920
give our you know to be destroyed

3400
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:43,760
cannabis to compassion programs which is

3401
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:46,079
great but um

3402
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:48,719
further things like the you know not

3403
01:52:46,079 --> 01:52:51,439
supporting cbd isolate and hemp drive

3404
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:53,760
cbd full spectrum cbd products um

3405
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:55,759
because you have brands moving into the

3406
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:57,440
cbd space and they're saying oh fuck it

3407
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,199
it's available in an isolate form at

3408
01:52:57,439 --> 01:53:01,039
pennies in the dollar so you have people

3409
01:52:59,198 --> 01:53:02,879
like myself or drew tillman who were

3410
01:53:01,039 --> 01:53:05,679
running compassion programs where we

3411
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:07,920
were giving away tons of cbd medicine to

3412
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:08,880
two patients to children with epilepsy

3413
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:11,118
or people with cancer or

3414
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:13,679
anti-inflammatory conditions we were

3415
01:53:11,118 --> 01:53:16,479
autoimmunes and you know now we can't

3416
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:18,480
because it i mean at the cost of you

3417
01:53:16,479 --> 01:53:20,399
know of regulation and the square

3418
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:23,519
footage we're given we can't afford to

3419
01:53:20,399 --> 01:53:25,279
grow it anymore and so it and you know

3420
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:27,599
if we were to sell it which i've never

3421
01:53:25,279 --> 01:53:30,000
sold cbd in my life either one of those

3422
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:31,679
i could i just couldn't do it i wish

3423
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,599
that there was a way to you know

3424
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:34,880
maximize square footage but at the end

3425
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:37,279
of the day you just can't do that you

3426
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:39,359
can't sell it to kids

3427
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:41,519
but you know now we have to support

3428
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:43,359
those programs those compassion programs

3429
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:45,840
we have to support you know

3430
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:47,679
you know i i would i have to say

3431
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:50,480
at you know

3432
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:52,560
asking your local dispensaries asking

3433
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:54,399
your local politicians and everyone you

3434
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,400
know getting involved

3435
01:53:54,399 --> 01:53:58,079
in compassion is the biggest thing that

3436
01:53:56,399 --> 01:53:59,759
we have right now

3437
01:53:58,079 --> 01:54:01,599
because these big hemp companies are

3438
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:03,760
coming in and they're just driving the

3439
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:05,119
full spectrum out of you know out of

3440
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:09,199
business and

3441
01:54:05,118 --> 01:54:11,839
yeah i don't mix two messages there but

3442
01:54:09,198 --> 01:54:14,238
don't buy cbd isolate we have the we

3443
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:15,520
have the first we have the first farm

3444
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:16,479
in oregon

3445
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:17,760
uh

3446
01:54:16,479 --> 01:54:19,359
it's a hem farm

3447
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:22,239
full they make

3448
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:24,158
full spectrum cbd tincture uh and it's

3449
01:54:22,238 --> 01:54:26,638
the first cannabis farm that's a b corp

3450
01:54:24,158 --> 01:54:28,000
yeah and they're fucking awesome

3451
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:30,079
b corp's good way to go yeah you know

3452
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,000
the other way sin is legalization we got

3453
01:54:30,079 --> 01:54:33,519
to get more states to legalize simple as

3454
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,279
that i mean uh

3455
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:37,119
uh you know i think the oregon

3456
01:54:35,279 --> 01:54:38,238
experiment experiment

3457
01:54:37,118 --> 01:54:41,039
in a way

3458
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:42,799
has resulted in 50 ounces

3459
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:44,560
which which is pretty compassionate when

3460
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,159
you you get down to fifty dollar rounds

3461
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:47,679
we've been accidentally compassionate

3462
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:50,079
yeah accidentally we didn't mean to be

3463
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:52,000
so compassionate right right right but

3464
01:54:50,079 --> 01:54:54,559
but i but i do think more legalization

3465
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,719
and i did i hear today that the

3466
01:54:54,560 --> 01:55:00,159
that the federal government finally said

3467
01:54:56,719 --> 01:55:02,399
cbd is now not scheduled not scheduled

3468
01:55:00,158 --> 01:55:04,960
yeah that is a big deal that's a very

3469
01:55:02,399 --> 01:55:07,359
big deal and and again we just we got to

3470
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:09,039
make sure that whatever it goes into

3471
01:55:07,359 --> 01:55:11,759
you know we're able to control how it's

3472
01:55:09,039 --> 01:55:14,158
how it's done and unfortunately that not

3473
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:15,599
so easy all right next next question did

3474
01:55:14,158 --> 01:55:17,439
that answer your question

3475
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:19,920
yes okay okay

3476
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:21,039
also you know just to say

3477
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,679

3479
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:27,599

3480
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:29,598
i know you do it i love you so i usually

3481
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:32,480
i just usually just take that anyway we

3482
01:55:29,599 --> 01:55:33,840
got like five minutes just to say so uh

3483
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:34,959
recently you guys been talking about

3484
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:36,239
shrinking profits you've been talking

3485
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:37,359
about uh general education of the

3486
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:39,359
consumer and stuff like that and

3487
01:55:37,359 --> 01:55:40,719
educating um you know your bud tenders

3488
01:55:39,359 --> 01:55:42,559
and stuff but as a like let's say you're

3489
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:43,920
a dispensary owner you've got you carry

3490
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:45,760
20 30 brands you know and you've got

3491
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:47,679
let's say five bud tenders you know

3492
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:49,280
let's say that brands were able to

3493
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:51,359
afford sales reps and they were bringing

3494
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:53,840
sales reps to your dispensary would you

3495
01:55:51,359 --> 01:55:54,960
have the time and would you be

3496
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:57,279
able to

3497
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,520
educate all of your employees

3498
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:02,079
on 30 different brands um would you have

3499
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:04,080
the space in your uh dispensary to allow

3500
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:05,760
like literature of a general education

3501
01:56:04,079 --> 01:56:07,840
about your brand or about other brands

3502
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,760
you know i think that a big issue is not

3503
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:11,279
that dispensary owners can't they just

3504
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:12,800
can't afford it you know there's a lot

3505
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:14,880
of things that i'm not expensive i don't

3506
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:16,639
know so i feel like you guys have

3507
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,159
way more experience you know we we were

3508
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:19,679
just talking about i got approached by a

3509
01:56:18,158 --> 01:56:20,879
bunch of my uh

3510
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:22,560
partners that are farmers that don't

3511
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:25,520
have stores and they asked me if i could

3512
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:27,920
um move their product since we've

3513
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:30,239
changed the classifications on where you

3514
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:31,920
can sell and so my thing was i wanted

3515
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:33,678
the farmers i wanted to send a rep with

3516
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:35,118
me and so what it does is i can have a

3517
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:37,760
mobile storefront so i can set up a

3518
01:56:35,118 --> 01:56:39,118
storefront at these different locations

3519
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,119
that are allowed through whatever county

3520
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:42,960
we do but i wanted the farmers to be

3521
01:56:41,118 --> 01:56:44,559
present someone from the farm to be

3522
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:47,039
present from that brand it's it's a

3523
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:49,119
crucial because what i i'm not trying to

3524
01:56:47,039 --> 01:56:50,560
be the face of the of their brand i'm

3525
01:56:49,118 --> 01:56:52,639
just trying to be someone who sells

3526
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:54,960
their brand i want the farmer to make

3527
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:57,440
the relationship with the customer we

3528
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:59,118
just happen to be a one of the sellers

3529
01:56:57,439 --> 01:57:01,039
and then what it does it allows the

3530
01:56:59,118 --> 01:57:02,960
individuals who are coming to buy

3531
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:04,399
cannabis to meet the farmers themselves

3532
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:06,399
the farmers can then

3533
01:57:04,399 --> 01:57:08,559
educate these people and if you were

3534
01:57:06,399 --> 01:57:10,319
doing your job as a store owner then you

3535
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,840
you you take the people that are your

3536
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:13,679
blood tenders and you you do put them

3537
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:16,880
through a system where you you bring

3538
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:18,800
them to farms you bring them to farmers

3539
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,319
you let them get a good exposure you got

3540
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:21,360
to put in the homework

3541
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:23,198
and

3542
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:25,279
i think that it's easier for us where we

3543
01:57:23,198 --> 01:57:27,118
are because we have a proliferation of

3544
01:57:25,279 --> 01:57:29,279
craft people around us

3545
01:57:27,118 --> 01:57:30,639
and so it allows it a lot easier for us

3546
01:57:29,279 --> 01:57:32,479
to go up and check out if i'm going to

3547
01:57:30,639 --> 01:57:33,679
ganja rebels farm tuesday so i can check

3548
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:35,598
out all his products we're going to

3549
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:37,679
carry some exclusive work of his right

3550
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:39,119
so i mean i know dan forever but i'm

3551
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:40,560
gonna bring a couple of guys with me so

3552
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:42,158
they can see what he's working with and

3553
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:44,480
they can see his new product line so

3554
01:57:42,158 --> 01:57:46,000
then this way they're educated on you

3555
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:47,678
know why we think it's good and why we

3556
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,719
think the public should enjoy some of it

3557
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:53,199
and it would have you know gradients of

3558
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:55,599
potency different profiles

3559
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:56,399
so that you have a true um

3560
01:57:55,599 --> 01:57:57,840
uh

3561
01:57:56,399 --> 01:57:59,519
choice selection

3562
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,119
but it's though it's the dispensary

3563
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,040
owner's job

3564
01:58:01,118 --> 01:58:05,039
to educate the people who work in the

3565
01:58:03,039 --> 01:58:07,359
facility so they know enough and that

3566
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:09,039
that's about your commitment to the

3567
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:10,559
industry long term

3568
01:58:09,039 --> 01:58:12,479
i think that with a lot of stores it's

3569
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:13,840
just if you're in a good geographic area

3570
01:58:12,479 --> 01:58:15,439
you get a lot of turnaround people

3571
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:17,760
coming through i don't think that

3572
01:58:15,439 --> 01:58:20,479
emphasis is placed as much i think that

3573
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:22,560
um jeremy's dispensary in oregon uh

3574
01:58:20,479 --> 01:58:24,319
pharma i think that he shines at this

3575
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:25,920
every monday the whole staff sits down

3576
01:58:24,319 --> 01:58:27,599
and they bring a scientist in to talk to

3577
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:29,359
them yeah you know he shines he's got a

3578
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:30,639
really really good thing and oregon is

3579
01:58:29,359 --> 01:58:32,559
pretty unique in that way where i think

3580
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:34,719
oregon has a more developed craft system

3581
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:35,760
than california does by far

3582
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:37,599
and

3583
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:39,840
even though california is the monster of

3584
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:42,079
the game oregon has a different level of

3585
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,840
appreciation of the finite details of

3586
01:58:42,079 --> 01:58:46,880
the product and i think that when i go

3587
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:48,400
and tour spots in in oregon i see a

3588
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:50,159
higher level of knowledge from the

3589
01:58:48,399 --> 01:58:51,679
people but it's also they can be more

3590
01:58:50,158 --> 01:58:53,920
intimate because you can also touch and

3591
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:55,520
play with the cannabis direct california

3592
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,800
is different peter that's your sound by

3593
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:58,400
right now california's different

3594
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:59,920
california you don't get a chance to

3595
01:58:58,399 --> 01:59:02,638
touch this product and so that's where

3596
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:04,880
you have to bring your workers that work

3597
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:06,639
for you to the location so they can

3598
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:09,359
actually see these products and get

3599
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:11,520
exposed to it and the idea is to try to

3600
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:13,519
find a cluster of farms that you can

3601
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:15,520
work with that can provide you with

3602
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:17,040
product right now it's brutal because

3603
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:19,679
you only have so many farms that are

3604
01:59:17,039 --> 01:59:21,359
online and distribution controls a lot

3605
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:23,840
of it and it makes it very difficult for

3606
01:59:21,359 --> 01:59:26,319
you to i used to focus on on local only

3607
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:27,520
right so i i was a local only guy for

3608
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:29,359
years

3609
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:31,199
and we were known for that where we

3610
01:59:29,359 --> 01:59:33,039
worked so hard to develop all these

3611
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:34,559
smaller brands where we would advertise

3612
01:59:33,039 --> 01:59:35,679
for you we would actually create your

3613
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:37,119
brand

3614
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:39,279
because we had the ability i had the

3615
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:41,118
money and i had the resources and so

3616
01:59:39,279 --> 01:59:42,719
what it did is it allowed us to further

3617
01:59:41,118 --> 01:59:44,158
and people ask why and i said because

3618
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:46,000
fundamentally i want to get their

3619
01:59:44,158 --> 01:59:48,079
product because it's a better product

3620
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,920
and if i can keep them alive then i can

3621
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:51,920
keep selling their product but that

3622
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:54,000
means we have to have a relationship in

3623
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:57,359
that form where the store owner and the

3624
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,439
farmer believe they're connected now

3625
01:59:57,359 --> 02:00:01,679
no one gives a shit who you are it's i

3626
01:59:59,439 --> 02:00:04,399
just need product on the shelf

3627
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:06,158
and so that's a a very transient type of

3628
02:00:04,399 --> 02:00:08,559
thought where it's anybody on the shelf

3629
02:00:06,158 --> 02:00:11,198
is fine and it can't be viewed in that

3630
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:13,440
way and so if you're a smaller operator

3631
02:00:11,198 --> 02:00:15,279
and you have an ability to

3632
02:00:13,439 --> 02:00:17,198
choose farms that you work with based

3633
02:00:15,279 --> 02:00:19,118
off of the ethics that you believe that

3634
02:00:17,198 --> 02:00:20,559
they should grow with and you have

3635
02:00:19,118 --> 02:00:22,399
enough of them to give you a product

3636
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:24,400
diversity and you have enough of them to

3637
02:00:22,399 --> 02:00:26,559
be able to give you sustainability over

3638
02:00:24,399 --> 02:00:29,279
the course of a fiscal year then you can

3639
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:31,199
actually get a knowledge base on that

3640
02:00:29,279 --> 02:00:33,039
and then you have to hold that line

3641
02:00:31,198 --> 02:00:34,319
where you focus on those products and

3642
02:00:33,039 --> 02:00:36,158
those things

3643
02:00:34,319 --> 02:00:38,479
and that that requires

3644
02:00:36,158 --> 02:00:40,000
a different view of cannabis business

3645
02:00:38,479 --> 02:00:41,439
and i would say 85 percent of the

3646
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,840
businesses in cannabis right now are

3647
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:45,359
here just to grab the cash yeah so kevin

3648
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:46,880
you know i don't fault it but i don't

3649
02:00:45,359 --> 02:00:49,118
think it's the right way to go we

3650
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:50,800
identified that kink in the supply chain

3651
02:00:49,118 --> 02:00:52,399
with the exchange so we created that

3652
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:54,800
emerald outpost so what we now

3653
02:00:52,399 --> 02:00:56,158
aggregated 25 plus brands we aggregate

3654
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:57,599
all the brands in northern california if

3655
02:00:56,158 --> 02:00:59,920
you want what we've done is we've taken

3656
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:03,039
ambassadors and and we've only linked

3657
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:04,960
four to five farms like five being max

3658
02:01:03,039 --> 02:01:06,880
so that ambassador actually knows those

3659
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:08,880
five brands in and out comes up to the

3660
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:10,239
farm knows everyone visits the farm and

3661
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:12,159
they can come down to the dispensary as

3662
02:01:10,238 --> 02:01:14,479
soon as we eclipse five brands per

3663
02:01:12,158 --> 02:01:16,319
ambassador we add another ambassador the

3664
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:17,519
brands pay for the ambassador they pay

3665
02:01:16,319 --> 02:01:20,799
us a

3666
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:22,480
referral fee similar to brokering like

3667
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:24,800
we're brokers essentially we're not

3668
02:01:22,479 --> 02:01:26,799
distributors we saw that these these

3669
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:28,239
products were just being dumped into

3670
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:29,920
distributors we were visiting the

3671
02:01:28,238 --> 02:01:32,000
distributors because we were trying to

3672
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:33,599
get the distributors into the exchange

3673
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,960
we're visiting these distributors and

3674
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:36,079
we're like holy crap you've got all this

3675
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,359
shit sitting there what are you doing

3676
02:01:36,079 --> 02:01:39,840
with it our friends and neighbors aren't

3677
02:01:37,359 --> 02:01:42,000
getting paid no one's getting paid and

3678
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,360
who the fuck is selling this and no one

3679
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,679
from the distribution company they

3680
02:01:43,359 --> 02:01:48,799
couldn't they had two three guys out

3681
02:01:45,679 --> 02:01:51,359
there with you know two 400 skate skus

3682
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,880
on the shelves so the idea is it's like

3683
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:55,359
the brands

3684
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:57,359
then pay the ambassadors the ambassadors

3685
02:01:55,359 --> 02:01:59,519
go to the dispensaries

3686
02:01:57,359 --> 02:02:01,279
exactly and then eventually what we're

3687
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:03,280
going to be doing once we allow for

3688
02:02:01,279 --> 02:02:06,000
on-site consumption after 20 you know

3689
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:07,118
after the january the 2020 passed that

3690
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,719
we're going to start bringing all the

3691
02:02:07,118 --> 02:02:10,399
dispensary owners and everyone up there

3692
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:12,158
for full experience driven tourism

3693
02:02:10,399 --> 02:02:15,039
models through the exchange and have

3694
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:16,719
that like full you know the the full

3695
02:02:15,039 --> 02:02:18,960
gamut you know for the for the brands

3696
02:02:16,719 --> 02:02:21,359
themselves but yeah i mean it is it is a

3697
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:23,599
thing it's like you right now it's just

3698
02:02:21,359 --> 02:02:25,519
another job that we've got we got to

3699
02:02:23,599 --> 02:02:28,079
keep on we got to keep on moving we

3700
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:30,480
cannot sit and let weeds sit on the

3701
02:02:28,079 --> 02:02:32,319
shelves in northern california that is

3702
02:02:30,479 --> 02:02:34,718
our bread and butter that is that is our

3703
02:02:32,319 --> 02:02:35,920
mortgage payment that feeds our dog you

3704
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:37,760
know what i'm saying like that is our

3705
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:39,679
gas money is sitting on the shelves of

3706
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:41,679
the distributor some somewhere in l.a

3707
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:44,319
that sucks but you bring up a good point

3708
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:46,560
though the dispensary has a much bigger

3709
02:02:44,319 --> 02:02:49,039
responsibility than they're taking on

3710
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:50,960
yeah they want to make money exactly but

3711
02:02:49,039 --> 02:02:52,639
you know when you go in there and you're

3712
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:54,239
waiting to get in

3713
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:56,079
there should be some better reading

3714
02:02:54,238 --> 02:02:57,678
material and the crap that's sitting on

3715
02:02:56,079 --> 02:02:59,039
it there should be teaming with microbes

3716
02:02:57,679 --> 02:03:01,039
you know i mean

3717
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:03,198
but but there should be better reading

3718
02:03:01,039 --> 02:03:04,800
material there should be the regulatory

3719
02:03:03,198 --> 02:03:08,000
agency should be helping with the

3720
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:09,520
education when you leave dispensaries

3721
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,118
you get the little card that says you

3722
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:12,719
know if you're pregnant uh you know

3723
02:03:11,118 --> 02:03:15,198
there's all that kind of stuff that that

3724
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:17,039
they force on us they could also force

3725
02:03:15,198 --> 02:03:18,479
on us a little education you need to

3726
02:03:17,039 --> 02:03:20,960
know terpenes you need to know the

3727
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:23,039
numbers so just just you know

3728
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,760
we're making a little science but

3729
02:03:23,039 --> 02:03:25,599
we're going to give it out to

3730
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:27,440
dispensaries there you go it's going to

3731
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:29,119
be like weed science for a civilian

3732
02:03:27,439 --> 02:03:31,198
right a little pamphlet we use your

3733
02:03:29,118 --> 02:03:33,118
galaxy at the nursery so at the nursery

3734
02:03:31,198 --> 02:03:34,879
i got i got a 40 inch flat screen on the

3735
02:03:33,118 --> 02:03:36,559
wall that just has the galaxy on it

3736
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:38,239
right because we have a tremendous

3737
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:40,080
number of strains mapped

3738
02:03:38,238 --> 02:03:42,479
and what it does it allows people to

3739
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:44,559
come in and start to see these

3740
02:03:42,479 --> 02:03:46,158
relationships between varietals and they

3741
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:48,159
can start to get their mind peaked on

3742
02:03:46,158 --> 02:03:49,759
hey these things are connected because

3743
02:03:48,158 --> 02:03:51,598
really that

3744
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:53,599
you sometimes you can only find certain

3745
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:55,840
things certain places but you want to

3746
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:57,279
find something similar and so what we

3747
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:59,199
want to be able to do is get you to

3748
02:03:57,279 --> 02:04:01,118
understand hey these things are related

3749
02:03:59,198 --> 02:04:02,479
they're close and that way when you're

3750
02:04:01,118 --> 02:04:03,759
in la you might be able to find

3751
02:04:02,479 --> 02:04:05,439
something that works for you like you

3752
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:07,119
did in mendocino or in humboldt or in

3753
02:04:05,439 --> 02:04:08,158
siskiyou or wherever you're at because

3754
02:04:07,118 --> 02:04:09,679
what you're trying to do is you're

3755
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:11,759
trying to get the individual who's

3756
02:04:09,679 --> 02:04:14,480
buying the product to enjoy the

3757
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:17,039
experience of buying the product

3758
02:04:14,479 --> 02:04:18,959
and in that process they start to become

3759
02:04:17,039 --> 02:04:20,238
educated but if you make it miserable

3760
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:21,679
and i'm telling you right now i'm

3761
02:04:20,238 --> 02:04:22,559
somebody who loves to read most people

3762
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:24,399
don't like to read the damn thing

3763
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:26,320
anymore so that's why i shoot so much

3764
02:04:24,399 --> 02:04:27,598
video because people really want it

3765
02:04:26,319 --> 02:04:29,279
delivered

3766
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:30,880
and what you can do then is you can give

3767
02:04:29,279 --> 02:04:33,118
i give them all the strain info so all

3768
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:35,039
the varieties i give you a full digital

3769
02:04:33,118 --> 02:04:36,639
breakdown of everything we're touching

3770
02:04:35,039 --> 02:04:38,078
so this way you can go home and look at

3771
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:39,760
it and come back and say hey i want to

3772
02:04:38,078 --> 02:04:41,279
cultivate this i want to do that and i

3773
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:43,280
think that has to be done with a lot of

3774
02:04:41,279 --> 02:04:44,800
the the strains themselves most of the

3775
02:04:43,279 --> 02:04:46,960
videos you see people smoking weed it

3776
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:49,360
just doesn't give you the info you need

3777
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:51,198
and that has to be done from from a

3778
02:04:49,359 --> 02:04:52,960
stability sense where it's easier as a

3779
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:56,000
nursery because i control the the

3780
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:57,279
material right so i i have this material

3781
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,439
i can say look we're going to run it for

3782
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:01,198
this many years we have it but with

3783
02:04:59,439 --> 02:05:03,839
purchasing products

3784
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:05,359
it's constantly new turnover and that's

3785
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,039
why i think that a lot of the stores you

3786
02:05:05,359 --> 02:05:09,279
have to kind of limit what you actually

3787
02:05:07,039 --> 02:05:12,238
carry i would rather see less choices at

3788
02:05:09,279 --> 02:05:15,279
a shop but better curated choices

3789
02:05:12,238 --> 02:05:17,198
so that you have a a better stability on

3790
02:05:15,279 --> 02:05:18,719
on how you sell it and what you know

3791
02:05:17,198 --> 02:05:19,839
about it yes and what you know about it

3792
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:22,078
so that you can really give a

3793
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:23,599
satisfaction to the user and then what

3794
02:05:22,078 --> 02:05:26,000
they do is they become educated and they

3795
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:27,520
go to any shop and use that education so

3796
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,039
not just us if you think about the way

3797
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:31,360
wine works

3798
02:05:29,039 --> 02:05:34,479
like if you're a waiter in a restaurant

3799
02:05:31,359 --> 02:05:36,799
and then you have a good wine list

3800
02:05:34,479 --> 02:05:38,559
so that's that's how i got to be a weed

3801
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:40,960
scientist right i was a waiter for a

3802
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:42,400
long time

3803
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:44,078
um

3804
02:05:42,399 --> 02:05:46,000
but you work in a restaurant that has a

3805
02:05:44,078 --> 02:05:47,840
decent wine list

3806
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,359
like you have to go to the tables all

3807
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:50,719
night long and you have to talk shit

3808
02:05:49,359 --> 02:05:52,399
about the wine

3809
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:54,639
and you have to have some idea what

3810
02:05:52,399 --> 02:05:56,479
you're talking about and so a good

3811
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:58,960
restaurant owner

3812
02:05:56,479 --> 02:06:00,718
every time there's a wine delivery

3813
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:02,480
they sit down with their entire wade

3814
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:04,239
staff or the or the person from the wine

3815
02:06:02,479 --> 02:06:06,399
company and you taste everything and you

3816
02:06:04,238 --> 02:06:08,559
talk about it and you learn about it and

3817
02:06:06,399 --> 02:06:10,238
then when you go to the tables

3818
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:12,079
you're not an idiot and you can actually

3819
02:06:10,238 --> 02:06:13,598
steer people towards something they like

3820
02:06:12,078 --> 02:06:15,279
and if you don't steer them towards the

3821
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:16,719
thing they like

3822
02:06:15,279 --> 02:06:17,840
you know then you don't make as much

3823
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:19,599
money

3824
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:20,960
but it's just like it should be like

3825
02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:22,639
that at dispensaries like you have to

3826
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:24,639
educate yourself to sell something to

3827
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:26,480
somebody it's hard with the weed though

3828
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:28,000
because with wine you can spit that shit

3829
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:29,839
out but with cannabis you're not

3830
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,840
spitting that shit out you're high and

3831
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:34,078
so that's where like me and the wine

3832
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:35,440
industry have beef because

3833
02:06:34,078 --> 02:06:37,439
we're training the bartenders to go like

3834
02:06:35,439 --> 02:06:40,719
this

3835
02:06:37,439 --> 02:06:40,719
that's how elon musk smokes

3836
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:44,239
and and the the thing is you know the

3837
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:46,079
individuals that's why that's why i

3838
02:06:44,238 --> 02:06:47,598
believe that the farmer

3839
02:06:46,078 --> 02:06:50,000
i think that that's what we're trying to

3840
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:51,760
do in our own world is and it's it's the

3841
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,359
only way i can see this really taking

3842
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:55,440
place is that you start to have the

3843
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:58,719
farmers come into your facility more

3844
02:06:55,439 --> 02:07:00,719
frequently they're present you advertise

3845
02:06:58,719 --> 02:07:02,399
for them to be present it allows

3846
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:04,719
individuals to start to meet the

3847
02:07:02,399 --> 02:07:06,799
individuals who produce the product

3848
02:07:04,719 --> 02:07:08,960
they're able they're actually able to

3849
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,880
consume with you off the site because

3850
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:12,480
they they have an ability to have an

3851
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:14,159
ounce legally on i mean this all has to

3852
02:07:12,479 --> 02:07:16,078
work in legal shit everything we based

3853
02:07:14,158 --> 02:07:17,439
our whole world off of was illegal so i

3854
02:07:16,078 --> 02:07:18,960
mean i'm somebody who's trying to figure

3855
02:07:17,439 --> 02:07:21,118
out how do you not step in a legal bear

3856
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:23,279
trap and lose your license

3857
02:07:21,118 --> 02:07:25,359
and so much of it is to let the farmers

3858
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:27,920
come in they can have an ounce in their

3859
02:07:25,359 --> 02:07:29,598
hand that they're allowed to show you

3860
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:31,118
outside that outside the room you can

3861
02:07:29,599 --> 02:07:33,520
have a separate area where people can

3862
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:35,439
look at products it can't be through the

3863
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:37,760
store you can't open that product that

3864
02:07:35,439 --> 02:07:39,759
product has to leave in a sealed bag all

3865
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:42,639
the criteria in california make it very

3866
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:45,520
very hard to have an intimate experience

3867
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:47,039
change it with what we did then i and i

3868
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:48,400
feel you change it sounds great now go

3869
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:49,679
do that guy but you're doing it but

3870
02:07:48,399 --> 02:07:51,039
you're doing it i know but i'm not doing

3871
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:53,679
it quick enough you're going to be able

3872
02:07:51,039 --> 02:07:55,679
to do on-site consumption some places

3873
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:57,760
it's it's all about zoning and it's

3874
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:59,760
about your county and so just like

3875
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:01,520
someone says we're california's legal no

3876
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:03,280
it's not go to go to uh calaveras and

3877
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:05,199
tell me it's legal so

3878
02:08:03,279 --> 02:08:06,960
it it's a radically different situation

3879
02:08:05,198 --> 02:08:08,960
depending where you are geographically

3880
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:11,279
and because of that you have to be able

3881
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:13,439
to find the loopholes that allow you to

3882
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:15,759
do it now or you won't be in business in

3883
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:17,359
a year to do it when it does change

3884
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:19,039
and that's why i think that you have to

3885
02:08:17,359 --> 02:08:20,399
be able to get your producers to come

3886
02:08:19,039 --> 02:08:22,158
into the place

3887
02:08:20,399 --> 02:08:23,359
and meet the meet the meet the buyers

3888
02:08:22,158 --> 02:08:25,198
themselves

3889
02:08:23,359 --> 02:08:27,519
and just make it casual to where it's a

3890
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:28,719
frequent situation i mean i'm lucky in

3891
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:31,599
the sense that the people that we have

3892
02:08:28,719 --> 02:08:32,960
at my shop are career so i pick career

3893
02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:34,639
people people that have been smoking for

3894
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:36,719
a while and i bring in older people i

3895
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:38,078
have 70 year old women that work for me

3896
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:40,000
because i think that they're the most

3897
02:08:38,078 --> 02:08:41,439
knowledgeable about medical cannabis of

3898
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,960
anybody i know they know how to do

3899
02:08:41,439 --> 02:08:44,078
holistic cannabis work better than

3900
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:47,599
anybody

3901
02:08:44,078 --> 02:08:49,679
and so i i need that type of situation

3902
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:51,279
to occur in my world so that when people

3903
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:53,440
come in and are asking for how do you

3904
02:08:51,279 --> 02:08:55,759
use this you can actually get people who

3905
02:08:53,439 --> 02:08:58,158
have been helping people for 20 30 years

3906
02:08:55,760 --> 02:09:00,719
with with medical type needs

3907
02:08:58,158 --> 02:09:02,238
but with with the farmer coming in

3908
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:05,198
the farmer is the only one that's going

3909
02:09:02,238 --> 02:09:07,198
to be able to get you to tie into this

3910
02:09:05,198 --> 02:09:09,359
and understand it or otherwise the blood

3911
02:09:07,198 --> 02:09:11,678
tenders they they have to be able to

3912
02:09:09,359 --> 02:09:13,679
serve as like a liaison but they don't

3913
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:15,118
have to be hyper knowledgeable to the

3914
02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:16,399
degree where they know every single

3915
02:09:15,118 --> 02:09:17,598
product because not every one of them

3916
02:09:16,399 --> 02:09:19,279
wants to so you can get someone who's

3917
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:20,880
phenomenal at customer service but they

3918
02:09:19,279 --> 02:09:22,559
don't they only smoke very very low

3919
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:23,840
potency weed and if they do they smoke a

3920
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:25,440
little bit of it at night when they go

3921
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:27,039
to bed so how the hell are they going to

3922
02:09:25,439 --> 02:09:29,039
help you out selling any of these other

3923
02:09:27,039 --> 02:09:31,118
products they can't and it makes it look

3924
02:09:29,039 --> 02:09:32,639
like they're incompetent but they're not

3925
02:09:31,118 --> 02:09:33,679
they're phenomenal representatives of

3926
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:35,359
your company and they're and they're

3927
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:36,960
great with people it's just that you

3928
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:38,799
need to be able to bring in other people

3929
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:40,800
that can explain

3930
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:43,279
why they chose this why did you choose

3931
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:45,199
you know orange chewy berry because it

3932
02:09:43,279 --> 02:09:47,118
makes this happen for me and then these

3933
02:09:45,198 --> 02:09:48,960
people and this is my antidotal this

3934
02:09:47,118 --> 02:09:50,880
number of people worked when we looked

3935
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:53,279
at the terp profiles and the potency we

3936
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:55,039
found it had unique ratios and it had

3937
02:09:53,279 --> 02:09:56,639
unique cannabinoid

3938
02:09:55,039 --> 02:09:58,719
compounds that we didn't see in other

3939
02:09:56,639 --> 02:10:00,880
things that's the education that lets

3940
02:09:58,719 --> 02:10:03,198
the buyer realize hey that's what that's

3941
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:06,000
what affected me now they know they can

3942
02:10:03,198 --> 02:10:07,439
find similarities in other things you're

3943
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,039
trying to give them an education not

3944
02:10:07,439 --> 02:10:11,039
just to buy stuff from you or from the

3945
02:10:09,039 --> 02:10:12,479
farmers that you're selling for but

3946
02:10:11,039 --> 02:10:14,560
you're trying to give an education to

3947
02:10:12,479 --> 02:10:16,479
any store they walk in they have skills

3948
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:18,079
and then any farmer they go to they have

3949
02:10:16,479 --> 02:10:19,598
an ability to work with

3950
02:10:18,078 --> 02:10:21,679
because that's industry building you

3951
02:10:19,599 --> 02:10:23,360
know it's not just you and one farmers

3952
02:10:21,679 --> 02:10:25,440
you're trying to build a new industry

3953
02:10:23,359 --> 02:10:26,639
but it's very difficult to do it the way

3954
02:10:25,439 --> 02:10:28,319
we did it where you could have an

3955
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:29,840
intimate relationship with the flower

3956
02:10:28,319 --> 02:10:31,759
where you could open it up touch it

3957
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:33,360
smell it look it christ we had a secret

3958
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:35,199
smoke lounge for years people smoking

3959
02:10:33,359 --> 02:10:36,479
down i can't do that anymore i mean

3960
02:10:35,198 --> 02:10:38,638
they're going through my garbage they

3961
02:10:36,479 --> 02:10:41,039
dump out my trap i've had the bcc in my

3962
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:42,960
my new shop three times since july

3963
02:10:41,039 --> 02:10:44,399
three times and we've nev we've never

3964
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:46,399
had any problems but i'm talking they're

3965
02:10:44,399 --> 02:10:47,759
dumping the trash out combing the god

3966
02:10:46,399 --> 02:10:50,158
damn trash

3967
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:51,599
so when they're going through your trash

3968
02:10:50,158 --> 02:10:53,839
and that's part of their that's part of

3969
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:55,920
their they're allowed to it makes it

3970
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:58,960
very hard to to do anything that's not

3971
02:10:55,920 --> 02:11:00,880
within a complete regulatory scheme

3972
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:02,319
and so you have to get around it by

3973
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:04,719
bringing in other people from the

3974
02:11:02,319 --> 02:11:06,880
outside that have an ability to be able

3975
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:09,279
to start making these connections and i

3976
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:10,480
think that's where together as a culture

3977
02:11:09,279 --> 02:11:11,840
we should do well because we've

3978
02:11:10,479 --> 02:11:13,279
historically been pretty cool even

3979
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:15,279
though we may not have done a lot of

3980
02:11:13,279 --> 02:11:16,880
business you know intimately we did

3981
02:11:15,279 --> 02:11:18,399
business when we needed to to make the

3982
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:20,400
make the pounds move

3983
02:11:18,399 --> 02:11:21,679
and we historically got along in a

3984
02:11:20,399 --> 02:11:23,679
pretty gentle

3985
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:25,599
caring method and i think that's the

3986
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:27,520
part that you have to bring forward to

3987
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:30,078
the public that they realize well i got

3988
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:32,239
you cannabis was always this kind of

3989
02:11:30,078 --> 02:11:34,078
situation and then that elevates him and

3990
02:11:32,238 --> 02:11:36,158
lets him realize i got you i have to

3991
02:11:34,078 --> 02:11:38,479
change the way i purchase i don't just

3992
02:11:36,158 --> 02:11:39,759
look at it to snap it up off the shelf i

3993
02:11:38,479 --> 02:11:41,519
actually take a second to get an

3994
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:43,360
education on it so this way i know what

3995
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:45,520
i'm looking for and then i can go and

3996
02:11:43,359 --> 02:11:46,399
find it at other places and if we all

3997
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:47,840
had a

3998
02:11:46,399 --> 02:11:49,920
common you know

3999
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:52,078
i'd say objective like that you'd see a

4000
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:54,239
radically different change in how people

4001
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:55,599
perceived what they bought and how much

4002
02:11:54,238 --> 02:11:56,479
they were willing to pay for what they

4003
02:11:55,599 --> 02:11:58,960
bought

4004
02:11:56,479 --> 02:11:58,959
that dog

4005
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:11,599
hello so i actually don't grow cannabis

4006
02:12:08,719 --> 02:12:13,039
i uh grow bugs to kill bad bugs on your

4007
02:12:11,599 --> 02:12:14,000
cannabis farm

4008
02:12:13,039 --> 02:12:17,679
so

4009
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:19,198
uh in conventional agriculture uh

4010
02:12:17,679 --> 02:12:22,560
one big thing that happens is a

4011
02:12:19,198 --> 02:12:24,479
globalization of pests uh asian citrus

4012
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:26,960
psyllid on citrus right now we have

4013
02:12:24,479 --> 02:12:28,718
lanternflies eating up entire vineyards

4014
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:29,679
over on the east coast

4015
02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:32,800
so

4016
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:37,199
at what point is uh pest resistance

4017
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:39,840
gonna become more than a novelty and uh

4018
02:12:37,198 --> 02:12:42,638
creating cultivars of uh cannabis and

4019
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:44,560
also on top of that what's the most

4020
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:47,520
susceptible strain that you've ever

4021
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:49,920
grown like what's the drosophila that we

4022
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:50,639
can test things on

4023
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,880
so

4024
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:52,880
go ahead

4025
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:57,599
so so we're

4026
02:12:55,359 --> 02:12:59,198
so we're working on pm first right so

4027
02:12:57,599 --> 02:13:02,319
we've collected

4028
02:12:59,198 --> 02:13:04,960
a bunch of incredibly susceptible

4029
02:13:02,319 --> 02:13:06,078
varieties and a cup and a bunch of

4030
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:07,279
varieties that have really high

4031
02:13:06,078 --> 02:13:10,238
resistance

4032
02:13:07,279 --> 02:13:11,759
we've sequenced the dna of pm varieties

4033
02:13:10,238 --> 02:13:13,678
from around the country

4034
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:16,400
so that we know when we're looking at pm

4035
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:19,279
which strain of pm it is because there's

4036
02:13:16,399 --> 02:13:19,279
a bunch of different ones

4037
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:23,360
we built a detached leaf assay so

4038
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:25,280
instead of running a breeding program

4039
02:13:23,359 --> 02:13:27,118
for pm in a in a building that you have

4040
02:13:25,279 --> 02:13:28,639
to saturate and mold

4041
02:13:27,118 --> 02:13:30,078
we can we can run it in a clean building

4042
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:32,239
and pull off a leaf and take it into the

4043
02:13:30,078 --> 02:13:34,880
lab and inoculate it with a known

4044
02:13:32,238 --> 02:13:36,959
quantity a pm and then quantitatively

4045
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:38,639
assess resistance

4046
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:40,560
so we're on it

4047
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:42,319
we're on it but it will take a little

4048
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:45,039
while and then we've got to do botrytis

4049
02:13:42,319 --> 02:13:46,238
and then we've got to do fusarium so

4050
02:13:45,039 --> 02:13:47,599
like

4051
02:13:46,238 --> 02:13:49,519
we just didn't have a way to do this

4052
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:51,520
stuff scientifically before

4053
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:52,800
but um

4054
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:55,119
now we can do it and then once you have

4055
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:56,639
a genetic marker for pm resistance you

4056
02:13:55,118 --> 02:13:57,759
can put that on all the backgrounds you

4057
02:13:56,639 --> 02:13:59,118
want

4058
02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:01,280
so sorry

4059
02:13:59,118 --> 02:14:03,439
two parts one is i'll give you

4060
02:14:01,279 --> 02:14:04,880
i got a question for you

4061
02:14:03,439 --> 02:14:06,319
um

4062
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:08,319
because we just had this crystal ortiz

4063
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:09,840
and i just had this conversation she had

4064
02:14:08,319 --> 02:14:12,158
a uh she had a

4065
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:14,159
root aphid no i think it was a it might

4066
02:14:12,158 --> 02:14:16,000
have been a russet might that they got

4067
02:14:14,158 --> 02:14:18,319
onto her plants so she she brought in

4068
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,399
predatory mites she does dry farming all

4069
02:14:18,319 --> 02:14:22,238
organic beyond organic regenerative farm

4070
02:14:20,399 --> 02:14:24,559
beautiful beautiful garden

4071
02:14:22,238 --> 02:14:26,718
she introduces a predator she predatory

4072
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:28,239
might right gets in works gets rid of

4073
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:30,158
the you know

4074
02:14:28,238 --> 02:14:32,000
stabilizes the environment

4075
02:14:30,158 --> 02:14:32,879
next year she does it as prevention

4076
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,719
right

4077
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:36,480
she's working really well she's at what

4078
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:39,039
point in time does the introduction of

4079
02:14:36,479 --> 02:14:41,198
this predatory might

4080
02:14:39,039 --> 02:14:44,639
be start to shift the natural

4081
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:46,238
environment of of my of my entire garden

4082
02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:49,039
when does the predatory might start to

4083
02:14:46,238 --> 02:14:51,839
breed and then take over in in in the

4084
02:14:49,039 --> 02:14:53,439
area so i think it was like a question

4085
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:54,800
for you is like have you done research

4086
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:56,238
on how to stop because i know the pike

4087
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:57,119
minnow when it was introduced into the

4088
02:14:56,238 --> 02:14:59,519
eel

4089
02:14:57,118 --> 02:15:01,519
right to kill to to kill mosquitoes

4090
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:03,280
ended up eating all the salmon eggs and

4091
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:04,480
so then they had this like huge like no

4092
02:15:03,279 --> 02:15:05,679
steelhead

4093
02:15:04,479 --> 02:15:08,638
because they had introduced the

4094
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:11,520
pikeminnow to kill the to kill the um

4095
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:13,679
you know to kill the mosquito so

4096
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:16,480
question to you is what

4097
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:18,000
how do you stop a predatory mite from

4098
02:15:16,479 --> 02:15:20,959
from breeding to

4099
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:23,840
ravage a a you know a garden called

4100
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:26,078
flora culture or when we're working on

4101
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:28,960
the smaller scale like uh praying mantis

4102
02:15:26,078 --> 02:15:30,880
for example there are barely any pray

4103
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:32,480
manta species that are actually native

4104
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:34,480
to the united states everything that you

4105
02:15:32,479 --> 02:15:37,919
see is a chinese mantis but on the

4106
02:15:34,479 --> 02:15:41,198
smaller scale everything is incredibly

4107
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:43,520
finicky so if there's no food there

4108
02:15:41,198 --> 02:15:46,399
the mites not going to exist same thing

4109
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:48,480
with uh parasitic wasps and peristic

4110
02:15:46,399 --> 02:15:50,158
wasps are one of the greatest fire

4111
02:15:48,479 --> 02:15:53,759
controls out there because without the

4112
02:15:50,158 --> 02:15:55,439
pest there's no parasite so so they kill

4113
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:57,520
the pest and then they die because their

4114
02:15:55,439 --> 02:15:59,519
food is gone yeah that's why you have to

4115
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:01,520
re-inoculate every year like if you're

4116
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:04,079
using oxidantalis you're using

4117
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:06,400
persimilis like persimilis doesn't even

4118
02:16:04,078 --> 02:16:09,599
survive year to year half the time just

4119
02:16:06,399 --> 02:16:13,039
because at some point the uh

4120
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:14,480
spider mites will go into diapause and

4121
02:16:13,039 --> 02:16:15,519
then once they're in diapolos they're in

4122
02:16:14,479 --> 02:16:17,598
the soil

4123
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:19,119
and ones go into the soil the other

4124
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:20,319
one's going right to the top of the

4125
02:16:19,118 --> 02:16:22,880
plant

4126
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:24,158
so if you pre-inoculate that might not

4127
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:26,078
even work because there if there's no

4128
02:16:24,158 --> 02:16:27,279
food there they'll just die right away

4129
02:16:26,078 --> 02:16:29,599
and they won't be there when the mites

4130
02:16:27,279 --> 02:16:32,000
do show up is that true

4131
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:34,558
that is true and there are solutions to

4132
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:36,558
this providing enough food for them you

4133
02:16:34,558 --> 02:16:38,159
can provide pollen for certain species

4134
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:40,478
they'll feed off the pollen until

4135
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:43,439
there's a better food source out there

4136
02:16:40,478 --> 02:16:46,239
or you can really just introduce a mite

4137
02:16:43,439 --> 02:16:48,239
that actually doesn't really do anything

4138
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:49,599
to your crop it's just kind of there

4139
02:16:48,239 --> 02:16:51,760
generally so

4140
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:53,439
official source yeah it's kind of like

4141
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:56,639
really

4142
02:16:53,439 --> 02:16:58,639
you're giving a dog some food in a bowl

4143
02:16:56,638 --> 02:17:00,159
and the food isn't gonna get up and

4144
02:16:58,638 --> 02:17:01,839
crawl away and start eating all

4145
02:17:00,159 --> 02:17:04,718
everything around yeah yeah all right

4146
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:07,599
the uh we gotta wrap it up on that uh

4147
02:17:04,718 --> 02:17:09,839
because there is a evidently a line of

4148
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:12,880
