1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,469
I always just do you know wet paper

2
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:10,619
towel and wait a couple days and so what

3
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:14,968
what's your if you had for example these

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:18,210
are all from Pacific Northwest routes I

5
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:21,710
have other stuff but like if you had 20

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,960
seeds or 50 seeds for your home grow

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:30,960
what's kind of your starting point from

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:35,399
a you know hard seed to sprout in okay

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,039
okay so seed germination is really what

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,859
the main goal is to is to get liquid to

11
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,170
be imbibed into the actual embryo so

12
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,570
that we can activate it chemically right

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,280
we get the enzymes moving and the

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,128
problem is is that people sometimes

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,899
think old seed will will not open up

16
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:54,269
quickly and new seed will open up

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,929
quickly because all you see is the

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,980
exterior of the seed and so what your

19
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:01,679
tough to make the part that makes it

20
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,718
hard to crack seed knowingly is did the

21
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,969
person who made the seed or did the seed

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,680
that was collected in wild did it

23
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,019
actually go through its full cycle and

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,390
put on a full carbohydrate load within

25
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,219
the embryo so that it's stored in the

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,739
quarter lead as they come out and then

27
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,969
it starts to turn into a plant once we

28
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,149
start to get real photosynthetic

29
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:23,219
activity but the fact that you don't

30
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,530
know how much carbohydrate is stored in

31
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,329
the seed is the issue that I see most

32
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,939
people have seed cracking issues with

33
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:32,789
and so what happens is if you don't have

34
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:35,250
enough food in the seed when it opens

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,170
when it imbibes and the plant starts to

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,420
emerge there's not enough stored

37
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,689
carbohydrates for this plant to actually

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,299
open up and so when people go into soil

39
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:47,609
direct which is really how little farms

40
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,439
are run in all other AG they don't start

41
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,750
them and then transplant they go direct

42
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,029
seed well the thing is is they know that

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:58,438
the seed they're using is loaded and

44
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,629
ready to go and so for the cannabis seat

45
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,328
certain people do better jobs with their

46
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,769
seed production and some batches come

47
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:06,989
out better than others and some of them

48
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:09,689
that have been stored for time on is you

49
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,989
know viable so what i always recommend

50
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,800
with cannabis seed is not to direct seed

51
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:15,780
what I like to do

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,330
first is take the collection a seed that

53
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,219
I'm gonna work with by variety and I

54
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,760
just put it into a little baby food jar

55
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:26,520
or a shot glass and if if if I have

56
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,229
extremely rare seeds I think are

57
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,930
something from the past that I know are

58
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:33,030
old I go a little bit further than just

59
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,370
putting water in the container I'll use

60
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,500
something like a seed tea so you can

61
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,020
germinate beans and pull the liquid off

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,270
and use that liquid and that liquid is

63
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,140
loaded with all these hormones and

64
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,689
enzymes that came from that plant and

65
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:52,019
it's directly a stimulant for other

66
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:54,509
seeds sorry when you say germinate beans

67
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,810
do you mean light like dry it like white

68
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:59,879
beans and anything you want to germinate

69
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,560
because ultimately any being--you that

70
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,109
you can get your hands on that you soak

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,750
in water and pull off that liquid it's

72
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,780
enzymatically charged to assist in the

73
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,750
germination of something so you can go

74
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,520
really deep into seed tea technology but

75
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,229
the thing is is if you have stuff that's

76
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,659
old so in your hands right now you have

77
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:20,909
all this brand new stuff and KY isn't a

78
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,590
good reader so he knows what he's doing

79
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,609
he produces a really good product and

80
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,000
he's been doing it for a long time

81
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:29,850
consistently so with stock like his all

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,530
I need to do is open that container get

83
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,479
a container of regular water it doesn't

84
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,459
have to be distilled water I pull it

85
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,109
right off the tap we're lucky in the

86
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,479
country where our taps come in around

87
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,400
like six seven if you're in you know the

88
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,869
Bay Area and you had eight three you

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,670
don't really treat it water I'm not sure

90
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,980
what like la and stuff like that is the

91
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,469
same thing then you'd be better if you

92
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,449
pick up some distilled water because all

93
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:53,159
you're gonna use that water for is just

94
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:55,289
to moisten the seed and what I do is I

95
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,139
throw the seed into that container and I

96
00:03:55,289 --> 00:04:01,769
usually add like a tiny drop of some

97
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,479
type of non ionic surfactant and that's

98
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,610
like a cocoa wet you know just something

99
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,009
and I stirred in the water and what it

100
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,230
does is it coats the seed with that

101
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:12,359
material which allows the water to bond

102
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:15,000
to it better and then I get better

103
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,269
penetration and I let the seeds sit in

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,399
that jar at least 24 30 hours and every

105
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,590
you know six seven hours all walk in

106
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,649
with the pen and I'll just stir the

107
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:27,829
container let him swirl around but so

108
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:31,620
these are fully submerged

109
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:33,359
mr. floating it floating because they

110
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,699
haven't imbibed the liquid and so that

111
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,160
that surfactant bonds to the the

112
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,759
pericarp the skin of the seed and allows

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,400
you to get water to actually you know

114
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,339
connect on like I'm on a molecular level

115
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,079
and then you just swirl them around a

116
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,669
couple times and I'll walk in once or

117
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,229
twice during that whole twenty four

118
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,840
thirty hour process and I'll give it a

119
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:57,330
little spin with a pencil and by the

120
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,159
time thirty I was of going by you should

121
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:01,050
see all of them at the bottom if they've

122
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,330
imbibed the liquid and if there's a

123
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,490
couple of floaters you can take a look

124
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:06,899
and realize that they are floaters where

125
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,400
they they're not gonna pick up any

126
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:10,049
liquor so they've been in there for

127
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,370
thirty hours and they're just still

128
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,710
floating on the surface

129
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,990
I can those but it's typically you're

130
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:17,219
gonna see you know 95% of the seed that

131
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,189
you put in the container will hit the

132
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,950
bottom I take those seeds out and I pour

133
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:25,110
it out onto a paper towel so that I can

134
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,089
then spread them out a little and I just

135
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,490
have a pair of really nice precision

136
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:32,009
tweezers and I just pick up each seed

137
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,290
and I place it into the media that I'm

138
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:36,000
going to use to do my actual true

139
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,910
germination and so what I've done in

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,670
that jar is I've been by liquid into the

141
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,590
embryo and I've got it moving now when I

142
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,780
go into the media that I'm going to use

143
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:48,269
I really like to use something that's

144
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,279
like a screen mix which means that this

145
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:52,620
it's really fine but it's gonna

146
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,259
composite a material so there's a mix of

147
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,329
cocoa mix of peat a little bit of some

148
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,000
kind of pumice so that it's very light

149
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:03,029
and highly aerated and what I like to do

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,699
is I don't put a hole in the dirt at all

151
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:08,279
i pre wet the tray so the tray has been

152
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,039
wet and then I just take the seed and I

153
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,349
literally put it right on top of that

154
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,660
soil right in the middle on each one of

155
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,370
those little cell flats and then once

156
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,470
everything set in place I have this

157
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,680
ultra fine mister I just run over the

158
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:26,250
top and it bends them right in in like

159
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,410
you know sixteenth to 1/32 inch covering

160
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,870
of the media because all we're trying to

161
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,970
do is get it to dark enough so that the

162
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,728
plant can can doesn't prematurely

163
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,590
desiccate before it opens and then the

164
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,449
plants crowd I don't I don't already in

165
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:40,888
take the seed I don't worry about

166
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,930
putting it down

167
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:44,460
line as a plant phototrophic and grab

168
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,468
atrophic which means the roots are gonna

169
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,718
go down whether you like it or not and

170
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:51,269
the shoots are going to go up so once we

171
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:53,939
lay it on that that tray and we give it

172
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:56,490
a light misting it begs them at this

173
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:59,039
perfect depth to where you're not

174
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,650
challenging the seed to have enough

175
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,938
stored energy to emerge from half inch

176
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:05,399
three I mean I've seen people berry

177
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,900
seeds deep and when you when you don't

178
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,549
get the germination what I used to do is

179
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,948
I stake the pot so I'm gonna cut them in

180
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,778
half and open them up and then you can

181
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,718
see that the seed had opened and had

182
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:17,728
extended 3/8 of an inch but did not have

183
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:20,218
any more energy to go any further and

184
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:23,519
subsequently died within that soil

185
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:25,829
chamber so if you lay the seed as a

186
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:29,038
delicate layer on top and just wet it in

187
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:32,278
and then sit it and ideally I would have

188
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,620
it with decent light and by the way the

189
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:37,168
taproot has not popped out yet correct

190
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,999
no no you're gonna see the emergence of

191
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:40,560
it you're gonna see the seeds swollen

192
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:42,180
and you'll start to see a crack and

193
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,310
you'll see the very beginning of that

194
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,838
tap and that's why I don't worry about

195
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,939
all the sitting bids when you're doing a

196
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:49,800
lot of seed trying to put each one in

197
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,150
the hold exactly as it is

198
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,158
when the water hits it it's going to

199
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:55,258
move a little bit the main point is if

200
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:56,819
that we crack it and open it so that it

201
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,210
doesn't have to fight to get out of the

202
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:03,509
shell and then we can bury it into the

203
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:06,628
media shallow and then get the bottom

204
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:09,689
end to be around 78 82 where the tray

205
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:12,060
itself is around 78 82 degrees those

206
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:14,399
things are going to jump and then as

207
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,750
soon as I get my first true leaf so

208
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,728
you'll according to lead will pop out

209
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,918
that was your embryo and then then you

210
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:22,978
get your first true leaves once those

211
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,750
first true leaves are there you're able

212
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:27,149
to start treating it with a stronger

213
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,180
nutrient solution but when we when we

214
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:33,389
typically put the plant into that pot we

215
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,549
don't really need any nutrients at that

216
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:39,328
moment because they should be stored

217
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:40,948
within the plant itself and so as soon

218
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:42,870
as we see the plant make its its

219
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:44,639
emergence we'll see to quarterly this

220
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,500
will see the first true leaf as soon as

221
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,429
those first realeased come in that's

222
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,259
when we fertilize and that would be your

223
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,969
sequence and then once we fertilize it

224
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:54,629
and soak them down now we start to be

225
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,509
able to have

226
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:59,939
everything present to build nutrient and

227
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:02,669
you don't want to go into heavily

228
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,320
fertilized soil as your base soil just

229
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:07,110
because it's a little aggressive for a

230
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,520
young seedling and so organically this

231
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,870
is you can do this organically

232
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,240
chemically it doesn't make a difference

233
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:15,929
how you deliver it it's just the fact

234
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,120
that the plant wants to be moisture then

235
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:20,729
it needs to have aeration and adequate

236
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,190
temperature and so you personally don't

237
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:26,190
use like cubes or anything like that you

238
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,900
just go straight to soil I would rather

239
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,050
go straight to swell and whisk let's

240
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,939
define soil of soil is so soil not dug

241
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:34,740
from the ground out of the earth but

242
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,200
something that we've manufactured right

243
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,620
and I most definitely would prefer to go

244
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,570
into that than cubes because the the

245
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,669
whole thing was if you're especially if

246
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:50,330
you're doing a lot of them the cost per

247
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:54,110
OSS or the cost per rock wall is so

248
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:58,410
disproportionately high compared to the

249
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,629
cost of regular media and so those are

250
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:04,740
excellent for propagation of clonal

251
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:06,779
because the the applicability of an

252
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,820
inert media lets you go anywhere with it

253
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,220
in terms of any direction any kind of

254
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,540
cultivation system but when I'm cracking

255
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,540
seed I'm looking for something that's a

256
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,699
cloning but when I'm cracking seed

257
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,649
because I used to do a lot of seed I

258
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,570
would I would always do it out of a

259
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:32,970
screen mix and so I could buy something

260
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,300
like what's a good mix right now that

261
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,460
you can buy commercially baby roots from

262
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:40,439
soil king right so soil king out of

263
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,480
cloverdale has a big roots mix oh he's

264
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,310
got a baby roots mix that kicks ass for

265
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,470
doing seeds it's already been

266
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:48,359
pre-screened and so you don't have to

267
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,860
screen it yourself through a screen to

268
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,259
make sure there's no clumpy shake and

269
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,259
then when you just lay the tray soak it

270
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,929
and you see that the cost per tray is is

271
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,939
you know nickels 20 cents it mean it's

272
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:01,669
cheap when you get right down to how

273
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,580
much it's costing you to fill the tray

274
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:07,259
versus ten eleven bucks for an oasis

275
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,910
sheet or you know depending on what what

276
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,340
quantity

277
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:12,409
where you're at but the course

278
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,750
differences is the difference and so

279
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:16,819
seedlings do wonderful in Rockwall and

280
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,440
seedlings do wonderful in Oasis and

281
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,660
they've been phenomenal in those cubes

282
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,240
right there but you know for the average

283
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:25,699
home individual I'm like buy bag a seed

284
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,590
mix and put it in your closet and shit

285
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,570
you'll have enough seed mix to grow seed

286
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:34,480
for the next five years if you're just

287
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:37,790
working small crops so now get into the

288
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,940
like be one and things like that do you

289
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:43,279
do you personally add anything to you

290
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,920
know the whole like root growth and

291
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,889
transplant shock and plant stress I

292
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:51,199
don't I don't and and the reason being

293
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:52,759
is that if you really you know a look in

294
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,500
California legal stuff you're not

295
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:56,569
allowed to use really any hormones

296
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,220
anymore for rooting so you can't really

297
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,710
use I don't think you can use in the

298
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,700
tear gas adorn a Placida Cassatt those

299
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:06,710
are those were plant acids that we

300
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,210
utilize to help drive rooting and

301
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,700
commercial agriculture we use them

302
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:13,280
cannabis only tonight leaves something

303
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:18,590
like clone acts or something like that

304
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:20,990
is that both of those so you're not

305
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:23,540
allowed to use that anymore in

306
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,370
California not for cannabis it's not

307
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:26,689
certified for cannabis production so

308
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,850
those are meant those are meant for like

309
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,530
ornamentals so you can buy it at the

310
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,720
store but it's not meant for food

311
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:35,269
production right and so cannabis is

312
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,550
regulated as a food production so you

313
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:38,899
use those to do coronal aids and what

314
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:42,829
you end up doing is you just end up

315
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:46,639
creating healthier plants and you strike

316
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:48,560
less viable ones you just call right out

317
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,819
of the mix and so California is going

318
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,199
into propagation you have a little

319
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,910
different strategy because you don't

320
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,040
have the tools to make things bite like

321
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:57,709
you once did but the seeds you don't

322
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,779
need that and if you take a look at any

323
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,269
of these like commercial rooting aids

324
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,549
they're basically a little bit of kelp

325
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:07,490
to make it look dark and then they're

326
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:11,449
adding some type of soy isolate protein

327
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:13,210
to it which is extremely efficient in

328
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,860
getting the plant to move aggressively

329
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,470
but the bottom line is you can buy soya

330
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,120
silly protein relatively cheap compared

331
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,410
to paying huge money for it mix it into

332
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,578
a can with a little bit of cow

333
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:24,828
to make it look like it's some kind of

334
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:26,870
special concoction so if you look at the

335
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:29,628
labels on those products they're really

336
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:32,980
they're they're micronutrients in a you

337
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:35,600
know organic matrix with some form of

338
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,310
soy isolate something that's going to

339
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,699
allow you to get high nitrogen

340
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:42,979
availability right now and the thing

341
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:46,219
with transplanting is that if you're

342
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,688
gonna go throwing like a water system

343
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,519
which gives you incredible routing right

344
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:51,649
so using water you get root water roots

345
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,419
if you go water roots into the water

346
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:55,370
systems they're unbelievable but if you

347
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:57,110
go water routes into soil list it takes

348
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,639
a minute for the plant to bite it in so

349
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,800
yeah they do bite in and yeah they have

350
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,589
great root balls on but there's a

351
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:06,528
there's a transition with plants having

352
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:08,209
to form the structure of the root and

353
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:11,360
the chemistry of the root to work with

354
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:13,758
the media that's on hand and so the the

355
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,278
fastest way to get any transplant would

356
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,050
be to utilize the system that you're

357
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:19,669
going to use in the end system so it's

358
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:21,708
gonna go soilless it can move through

359
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:23,149
all soil assistance if you're going to

360
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:26,328
go into the plug that you just showed

361
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:28,220
that composite rubber some kind of

362
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:30,229
organic material they wove into a matrix

363
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,439
that can go pretty much into anything

364
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:36,620
because it has movability

365
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:38,659
the root cubes they're good too because

366
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,129
ultimately the root is held inside it

367
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:41,750
really anything that's outside it's

368
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,980
gonna die off pretty much when you put

369
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,409
it into the pot some of you the new

370
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,528
roots that come out of it that make that

371
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:51,528
bug in connection and so if you're

372
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:53,389
trying to do you know it an easy routing

373
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:54,528
transition then what you're trying to

374
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:56,870
make sure is that you're looking

375
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:59,480
downstream of where is the end plant

376
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:02,209
gonna go and then you just match the

377
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,459
media so I use and doesn't be the exact

378
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:08,739
media but has to be similar so the

379
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:11,750
plants developing the system for the

380
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,639
transplant that's why usually your

381
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,769
transplant mixes are very simple and

382
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,180
light and fluffy and then it can go into

383
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:19,220
anything from there because you're not

384
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:23,778
having a large container of roots that

385
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:28,370
are gonna have to readapt and develop is

386
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:31,220
there anyone that you respect who you've

387
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:34,700
had conversations with about you know

388
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:38,940
this like popping

389
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:42,180
seeds to transplanting where they have a

390
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,519
totally they do something that like is

391
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:46,739
different than what you do and you're

392
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,769
like not what I do but that's actually

393
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,480
kind of interesting how you do it well

394
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:53,759
you know I mean I've been I've been in

395
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,690
prop for a really long time as a career

396
00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:00,450
and so I I had krietor cut some you know

397
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,339
commercial education in it and then I

398
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,930
functionally did it for a long time so

399
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:07,410
it let me experiment with a lot of ways

400
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:09,929
and what I know is that I've met a river

401
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:11,490
of people who have little subtleties on

402
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:13,769
how they go about it I know people who

403
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:17,339
do this really they do a nice job where

404
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:19,709
they use one gallon ziplock bags as many

405
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:22,440
greenhouses and they lay a a rolled-up

406
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:25,199
paper towel in the bottom of it as the

407
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,720
routing matrix and they set the imbibe

408
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,060
seed in a line all the way across and

409
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,459
they hang it up where it gets in direct

410
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:34,199
light and the seedling grows straight up

411
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,518
and basically they when they when they

412
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,589
cut open the back

413
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,750
they just with a pair of scissor chop

414
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:43,020
the paper towel and they have a little

415
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,240
paper towel ball of roots and a stem and

416
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,838
coital leading into and true leaves and

417
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,310
I mean sometimes I laugh because the

418
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,990
seedlings have so damn good like that

419
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:54,958
it's funny but they've got a more pin to

420
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:57,778
a wall in a room and and each bag is

421
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:01,559
labeled but their success on that stuff

422
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:03,899
was just unreal and it's really about

423
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:06,418
what works for you and your personal

424
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,039
life mean and like for me because I did

425
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,259
commercial work and I had commercial

426
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:14,389
facilities then I'd be able to utilize

427
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:16,410
racks watering system and and assistance

428
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,209
but for a lot of people if you just

429
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,069
crack in the seat it has to be simple

430
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:22,439
for you so that it doesn't get away from

431
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:24,990
you because once you once you heat them

432
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,870
up you kill them once you dry them out

433
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:30,480
you kill them if you keep them too moist

434
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,789
and not enough light you'll you'll get

435
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,339
some kind of damping off if you're using

436
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:37,139
too much light they'll they'll scavenge

437
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:39,359
themselves too quickly because they

438
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,070
haven't formed a root system so like all

439
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,109
these little things of how you screw up

440
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:44,428
is really what you have to kind of you

441
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:47,099
know take a look at yourself and figure

442
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,940
out how do you get around and I mean

443
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,589
I've seen people you

444
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,110
heating pads that you would use on your

445
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:53,730
elbows to crack seeds where you go and

446
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:54,959
go in the seed room and there's a you

447
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,278
know a heating pad with a little

448
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,500
three-way piece on it and if it's

449
00:17:56,278 --> 00:18:01,440
wintertime they hit high and if it's

450
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,929
summertime they'd hit low and they've

451
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,000
done unbelievable seed germination you

452
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:08,070
know so I don't think there's any one

453
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,750
method of doing it baskets just that the

454
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:11,158
one that I use is always work for me

455
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,859
well because it gives me a tray of

456
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,690
seedlings in a material that I can

457
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:21,898
utilize and the things that I go work

458
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:24,419
with next right so with with clones like

459
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:28,229
I've never been a fan of humidity domes

460
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:30,389
do you use humidity domes or are you I

461
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:34,230
feel like they make kind of wimpy plants

462
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:36,298
I do I well they they serve a purpose I

463
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,909
mean ideally like the best way I think

464
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:40,470
you can do propagation aside say let's

465
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,090
just we'll take micro prop out of this

466
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,319
race will take laboratory prop off

467
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:46,949
because that's out of the range of most

468
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:49,829
people to me the best system is is spray

469
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,778
tables and greenhouses because spray

470
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:53,428
tables allow you to be able to spray you

471
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:55,259
know in and you get if you can put a

472
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:57,570
fertigation solution in so that you get

473
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,250
in mild nutrients spraying on the plants

474
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:02,220
keeping your moisture levels high the

475
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,319
whole time it's using some type of

476
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,350
sensor to indicate how much moisture you

477
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,439
want present and if the climate changes

478
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:12,028
it changes how that frequency occurs so

479
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,808
that you're never going to over wet or

480
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:17,638
under way and you can utilize any type

481
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:19,408
of tray material you really want once

482
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:23,428
you once you dial in the amount of water

483
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:25,289
load so I like that system best for just

484
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,759
pure simplicity where you cut the tray

485
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:29,970
and stick it on a table and walk away

486
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:32,220
from it but humidity domes were always

487
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:35,129
for operations where you don't have the

488
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,159
ability to treat that water and so in

489
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:39,689
some systems you know you'll you'll miss

490
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,850
the whole room you'll increase the

491
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,620
moisture in a room but for me here in

492
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,689
Humboldt County the problem with

493
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:48,268
moisturize in a room is that when we get

494
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,389
the wet season in the in the half of the

495
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:54,480
year you can create mold factories that

496
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:56,368
are present in the rooms and so you have

497
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,679
to be able to control the environment so

498
00:19:56,368 --> 00:20:00,329
in the summertime sprays are a lot

499
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,160
easier because you're gonna suck that

500
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:03,480
moisture up and into

501
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,450
into the air and then you can pull it

502
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,519
out but in the wintertime any kind of

503
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:15,090
excess water in the spaces that we did

504
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:17,549
drop with just didn't work and so I use

505
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:20,129
froth trays and domes for indoor

506
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,659
operations because it allows you to be

507
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:25,650
able to control the environment a lot

508
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,540
more simply and if they're not difficult

509
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,340
to utilize if you just go through the

510
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,649
hardening process but you're using them

511
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,779
to keep the moisture level constant so

512
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:38,130
you can strike a roof once you strike

513
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:39,899
the route then you can start to harden

514
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,990
them off and then you pull the lids in

515
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,660
that BAM now you're in it but they work

516
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,279
really well for controlled environments

517
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,560
where you don't have the ability to put

518
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,619
that much water down as a spray the

519
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:54,839
spray tables to me the best and then and

520
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,519
then micropropagation where you know

521
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,679
you're propagating at a density and a

522
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,240
rate of success that's just you have to

523
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,830
see it to believe it and the plants

524
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,289
coming off of that are the the

525
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:06,539
ever-lovin opposite of wimpy something

526
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:08,579
coming off a season you know what I mean

527
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:11,399
like that is a Herculean little plant

528
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:14,159
because they're completely hormonal II

529
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,540
charged and they have no obstructions on

530
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,540
them from any kind of pathogen
