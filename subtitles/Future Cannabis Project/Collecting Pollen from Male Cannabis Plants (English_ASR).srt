3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,899
welcome back to Heart Rock Mountain Farm

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,300
here we are in our

5
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,358
mail Garden

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,558
and we've only planted

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,559
one two three four five

8
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,179
four and a few rows of

9
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,179
what has had

10
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,820
13 or 14 rows planted and they're deep

11
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,920
rows I mean each each row has 13 or 14

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,679
holes in there but it's kind of nice

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,320
having a small relaxing Nail Garden this

14
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,939
year and we're kind of tucked away in

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,558
here

16
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,140
um

17
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,479
and you know behind us is a big cattle

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,019
ranch in the National Forest

19
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,618
so the wind currents

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,299
take any stray pollen

21
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:10,739
far away from here

22
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,659
and

23
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:16,199
this is where we'll do our final

24
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,118
selection usually I only will flower out

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,920
you know no more than 10 males per

26
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,019
variety and that's just something if I'm

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,359
really trying to narrow something down

28
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:28,319
and I've you know I've already selected

29
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:31,560
for a structure and nose and now we get

30
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:34,139
to look at you know the bud structure

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,180
and we get these uh bouquet up and into

32
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,939
our pollen boxes

33
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,280
and then I'll make my final

34
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:44,059
I make my final notes

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,060
on

36
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,158
the cultivars

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,840
here we have our love laughter

38
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,579
and

39
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,740
I noticed that this one has the more

40
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:56,938
sweet Fino versus like the eucalyptus

41
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,099
Pine

42
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,438
so and I really like

43
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,000
the Strong Nose on this one

44
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,379
so I'll go ahead and give this one a

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,359
star

46
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,699
and

47
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,759
let myself my future self know later

48
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:14,479
that this was a sweet

49
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,479
you know

50
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:18,238
and then we upgraded the hanging tags

51
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,000
this year

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,378
because every year you'd always lose a

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,520
tag in the mail guard and be like okay

54
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:25,259
whoops

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,360
so the hanging tags is a good way to go

56
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:29,039
and

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,940
we drop that in

58
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,939
our jar of water

59
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,679
Falco number two brand brand new one

60
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,679
because I lost mine hiking

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,340
here we go

62
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,560
you can prune away extra leaves

63
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,340
and then we will end up with a

64
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,340
nice little bouquet

65
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:56,899
of male flowers

66
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:28,500
so when you're done there did you just

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,580
kill it off

68
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,439
yeah

69
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:33,599
um

70
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,519
yeah I really don't need it's our

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,900
CBD one I really don't need a lot of

72
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,698
pollen from

73
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:41,099
from that

74
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,900
although we I think

75
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,180
people always always hit me up in the

76
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:46,679
past to buy pollen and it's just so much

77
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,259
work to collect it that it's not worth

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,459
it but might be a

79
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,460
a good year to do it

80
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,220
and then this male is the um

81
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,219
eucalyptus pheno

82
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,300
of the love laughter

83
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,300
and I definitely

84
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,139
running low on level after seeds and

85
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,240
hope to do

86
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,418
a couple generations of work here with

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,418
them

88
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:32,519
you know it's kind of like you're taking

89
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:34,519
uh a cutting a very long cutting

90
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,519
um

91
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:53,219
and this method you know we just kind of

92
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,000
develop this out of

93
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,000
necessity

94
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:05,339
you know growing from keeping

95
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,319
less than a dozen males to 25 males to

96
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,859
75 males to our biggest year which I

97
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,740
believe was a we had 150

98
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,020
varieties of males

99
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,319
in the main Farm

100
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:21,478
did not get seated

101
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,439
but I was I spent a lot of nights that

102
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:24,599
year

103
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,879
up to two or three in the morning

104
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,819
you know working on processing pollen

105
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,819
and you know spraying down the garden

106
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,819
afterwards

107
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,800
and how much pollen can you collect from

108
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:48,799
a bouquet like this

109
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,859
a couple grams

110
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,319
which is a lot of pollen

111
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,300
you know if you were to like cut it

112
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,979
enough to make like tens of thousands if

113
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,978
not hundreds of thousands of seeds

114
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,079
especially uh

115
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:15,739
in the pollen boxes

116
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,740
they just

117
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,139
and it's a way that you know you can do

118
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:24,780
this on a smaller scale to really get a

119
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:27,900
lot of Pawn and a lot of diversity you

120
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,638
know because we're collecting pollen and

121
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:32,279
we're breeding Outdoors you know we're

122
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:36,259
not breathing in indoor under lights or

123
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,258
in you know greenhouses or anything

124
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:42,198
and that's probably enough pollen from

125
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,198
that one

126
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,259
and then

127
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,779
I like to

128
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:51,740
very slowly bend the rest of the mail

129
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,739
over to the ground

130
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,479
and cut it and then I'll come through

131
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,800
and

132
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,598
you know

133
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,220
spray this pollen off because if I were

134
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,259
to let this mail just dry here on the

135
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,720
ground and the wind could come pick it

136
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:10,560
up and take it off you know the the key

137
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,319
of the game is to get the the males just

138
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,899
as they're opening into the pollen

139
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,720
but we're kind of in a unique

140
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:20,818
environment for location to do this type

141
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,819
of you know outdoor pollen collection

142
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,919
that is not recommended for

143
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,400
um

144
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,799
everyone to do it this way

145
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:34,319
but the pollen boxes we're gonna go

146
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,940
walk these two love laughter meals

147
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,320
upstairs

148
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,320
and show you the Palm boxes

149
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:47,819
you know someday I love that little

150
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:50,000
cot Barn for pollen collection

151
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,000
foreign

152
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,060
when you're doing pollen collection you

153
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,180
need water and a spray bottle so I will

154
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,500
Mist off my arms and hands after there

155
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:14,819
and if I were to go out into the main

156
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,620
Farm

157
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,240
and I didn't I would definitely prefer

158
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,639
to change clothes but you could just you

159
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,560
know Mist your whole body off to kill

160
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,819
the pollen so then we're going to take a

161
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,819
look at these pollen boxes here

162
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:29,278
um

163
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,440
my first prototype was a cardboard box

164
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,659
but you know after a season of cleaning

165
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,240
them in between these use they were done

166
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:37,799
for in the wardrobe boxes were pretty

167
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,839
expensive

168
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,059
and what I did with the Wardrobe boxes I

169
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,459
would pre-slit the sides tape them back

170
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,379
up had an extra square of cardboard at

171
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,059
the bottom for the plate but this is

172
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:49,458
much better

173
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,500
um

174
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:56,899
technique so we have a sliding drawer at

175
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,899
the bottom with a Plexiglas sheet

176
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,299
okay

177
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,820
and they're numbered

178
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:06,599
this one here is 33

179
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,640
um

180
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,860
and then they'll sit in the in the jar

181
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,899
of water there for

182
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,039
a couple days a week sometimes if I

183
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,940
don't have a lot of males to move

184
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,338
through I'll let them just get

185
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,860
completely dry let them suck up all the

186
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,060
water and sometimes if you'll notice a

187
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,259
meal will be really thirsty and it

188
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,299
hasn't dropped its poll in it you might

189
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,759
have to refill that jar of water a

190
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:28,379
couple times you can do a light nutrient

191
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,139
solution

192
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:33,240
um in the your jar of water to give them

193
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:36,659
a little extra but and this room's well

194
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,539
lit which which is helpful

195
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,939
um I've I've haven't tried

196
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,799
maybe David would um Silver Dragon Farm

197
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,779
but he he adopted this Tech I think he

198
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,039
does it in the dark and then we have a

199
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,958
lid

200
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,059
with a hole in the middle and we stir up

201
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,439
some pollen which

202
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,439
we'll show you later

203
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,500
this isn't nice

204
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:05,039
looking man so this is

205
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,320
you zoom in on the flowers here this is

206
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,278
like the ideal time to cut a male like

207
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,680
there's

208
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,480
per bud you see like one pollen sack

209
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:15,239
opening if you were concerned about it

210
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,860
you you wouldn't let one open you would

211
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,039
let it get Chunky

212
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,899
start to open cut it jar it

213
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:23,879
and in a may like that you might need to

214
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,100
refill the jar a couple times for the

215
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,620
nutrient solution to finish but you know

216
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,860
they will

217
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,659
drop pollen in a jar of water

218
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,220
and what India if you don't you don't

219
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,899
need a box

220
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,600
you can just put that jar of water over

221
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,759
you know parchment paper on the counter

222
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,680
you know in one mail and you know it's

223
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,299
moving around your house make sure

224
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,338
they're not getting wind

225
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:49,338
and you can collect pollen

226
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,919
Lemonhead F3

227
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,720
this is that Tahoe Kim from Willits that

228
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,519
my my buddy made this is a really nice

229
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,100
one and

230
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,379
at least the F1 really hard to collect

231
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,139
pollen from which is interesting a lot

232
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:12,600
of times the male buds match the female

233
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,360
buds not the case

234
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,800
with that F1 where it had nice you know

235
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,339
chunky

236
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:23,099
dense buds a very sparse pollen but this

237
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,459
F3 now that's that's going to get some

238
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,459
pollen

239
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,220
and

240
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:31,078
you know we're hitting about three

241
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,040
percent terpenes in our no-till living

242
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:37,679
soil with it you know 25 to 30 percent

243
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:41,759
total cannaboids mostly THC

244
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:44,638
nice relaxing Indica body high

245
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,439
actually you know for me it was nice

246
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,899
because it wasn't like psychoactive a

247
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,540
lot of conscious is so psychoactive for

248
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,159
me it's not a relaxing body high but

249
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:56,219
this one lemon head was really nice and

250
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:59,360
relaxing and actually looking forward to

251
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,360
smoking some of the fresh stuff

252
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,300
I mean are you filming yeah this right

253
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,278
here look this is so and you get like

254
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:43,319
look at the structure like this is out

255
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,519
of all the Lemonhead males we're keeping

256
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,379
which is

257
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,959
you know maybe 10 of them because I have

258
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:50,220
different lines like this is a beautiful

259
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,599
bud

260
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,800
and that's one thing you really want to

261
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,259
look for that's why you want to keep

262
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,519
more than one male per variety so you

263
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,740
can see them flower you can see their

264
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,500
full expression and then this is a

265
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,480
gorgeous male flower

266
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,019
and um

267
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,019
yeah

268
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,160
they're edible too

269
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,338
and it's a a very light stimulant

270
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,338
come on

271
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:40,320
oh yeah that is

272
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,278
a beautiful bouquet of

273
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,278
lemon head flowers

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,659
you wanna try

275
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,980
it's like the newest delicacy

276
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:03,920
again in between males

277
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,919
you know you just miss yourself off

278
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:09,179
your tools

279
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,480
that way you're reducing cross

280
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:14,578
pollination which you know will happen

281
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,159
you know in a on a craft Farm like this

282
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:18,599
like it's really easy to tell when you

283
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,458
see when you get a purple plant where

284
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,980
you shouldn't have one but it's usually

285
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,838
just you know one pollen grain either

286
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,199
making it in the field or collecting it

287
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,199
in the field

288
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,820
I mean you definitely gotta um

289
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:34,799
you got to look for Herms in your males

290
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,820
I find keeping large populations of

291
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,419
males

292
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,320
the past couple years I find more

293
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:42,778
hermaphrodites in the mail Garden than

294
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,760
you do in your in the females

295
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,500
and it they're sneaky and just some

296
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,778
hairs on this that's really one good

297
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,879
thing to look out for

298
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:52,799
and

299
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,838
you know you can see

300
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:58,679
which ones are having more or less pest

301
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,860
damage it's always good to take notes on

302
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,359
but definitely look out for

303
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,579
hermaphrodites in your males almost more

304
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,980
than your females from my experience and

305
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:09,359
because you're if you if you keep that

306
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,320
pollen

307
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,240
yeah it'll have that that trait

308
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,278
um you know we don't want to breed

309
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,278
purposefully for intersex

310
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,339
and the main reason I strip away the

311
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,019
leaves is

312
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,440
you just fit more

313
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:36,600
bouquets more stems in the jar that way

314
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,540
but when I go to dump these out of the

315
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,800
jar like it's molded and rotted out in

316
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:44,219
the jar

317
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:47,419
by the time if I let them go long enough

318
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,420
and um

319
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,638
yeah and as you you know sometimes

320
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,198
you'll find that little sneaky

321
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,820
hermaphrodite as you're like harvesting

322
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:55,979
the mail so it's definitely good

323
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,820
to pay attention to

324
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,199
um

325
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,540
and it's something that I've just

326
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:02,578
discovered keeping large populations of

327
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:04,139
males I haven't come across any this

328
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:06,539
year

329
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,480
and that's another reason to keep

330
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,918
more than one male per variety

331
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,599
there's always a bump because and

332
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,419
sometimes the pollen

333
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:18,418
you know doesn't keep collect

334
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:20,640
and with the onset of the hemp aphids

335
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,579
it's even good to spray your male Garden

336
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,559
your male plants because too many aphids

337
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:29,000
can ruin the pollen

338
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:29,000
in your collection boxes

339
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:35,580
and so just like an uh just a soap is

340
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,820
good enough preventative to

341
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:40,798
uh knock back the aphids

342
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:42,418
because they will destroy trays of

343
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,960
pollen

344
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,960
just

345
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,980
what do they do in the pollen

346
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,360
um

347
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,038
you know maybe it's like they're

348
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:02,219
shedding actually it just cakes it up

349
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:05,220
and it it uh and maybe they're like

350
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,220
excretion

351
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:11,038
you see we do have like a light wind

352
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:12,599
blowing this way so I also see which way

353
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,740
the wind's blowing and kind of do my

354
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,740
Harvest that day

355
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,359
but I think with the empty boxes we have

356
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,279
upstairs we're going to be able to clear

357
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,579
out the majority of this mail Garden

358
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,579
today

359
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,879
all right we'll run these up

360
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,579
put a little palm box because we just

361
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,460
want to prevent the wind from hitting

362
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,960
these even a slight breeze so that when

363
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,279
the pollen drop it just falls to the

364
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,120
bottom

365
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,119
of the box

366
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:53,819
when I take the Mayo flowers out of the

367
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:56,159
pollen box this is I dip them in water

368
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:58,798
so it's like

369
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,019
definitely a Dom

370
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,619
and bubbling up real quick I just filled

371
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:03,619
this up last night

372
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:18,240
and see this this area here

373
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:19,500
doesn't get harvested it's a crossover

374
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,419
branch

375
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,419
and anything that's touched

376
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,000
thank God pollen's not in metric that

377
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
you know imagine having to track and

378
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,200
Trace there wouldn't have been the way

379
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,538
and there's really no

380
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,460
you know psychoactive use for pollen

381
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:46,460
this is like basically hemp

382
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,798
what do you mean me and Max have been

383
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:01,200
smoking these

384
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,960
huh we've been smoking this

385
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,819
the males yeah just for fun yeah is it

386
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,220
working

387
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:09,720
just kidding okay

388
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,839
well someone someone told me that

389
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,579
they've smoked pollen on Instagram

390
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,379
now I already harvested the Lemonhead

391
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,779
Skittles males so these are all just

392
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,880
different Lemonheads so this is that was

393
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,660
three different seed lots of

394
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,660
lemon head f3s

395
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,080
you know and it's also important to take

396
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:30,960
your seed Lots down different lines

397
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:34,199
because you might it's a it's a lot of

398
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,779
work to take a a line down the road

399
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,340
and if you go different Forks you have

400
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:40,019
more of a chance of that if you made a

401
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:41,519
mistake with one you didn't make it with

402
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:44,460
the other

403
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,319
and then when you get several lines

404
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,819
way down the road to like your f8

405
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,740
generation

406
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:53,879
then you can cross those with each other

407
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,740
and and easily exchange traits

408
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,299
you know like oh this one's got the nose

409
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,980
and the smell but this one has the pest

410
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,259
resistance

411
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,558
so you cross them together

412
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:08,179
and that's uh that new

413
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,178
and can transfer those traits

414
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:18,500
welcome to dude Bros Farms

415
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,500
foreign

416
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,899
so now

417
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:37,019
we have a male bouquet that's been our

418
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,340
pollen boxes for several days and this

419
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,460
one actually the the flowers are

420
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:42,298
starting to dry and we have this high

421
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,019
tech

422
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:48,900
device here and we have a Plexiglas lid

423
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:51,000
and we're gonna shake this baby up and

424
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:55,640
send that pollen down

425
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,640
to our plexiglass sheet in the bottom

426
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,538
are you ready

427
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,140
oh yeah he's a duster

428
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:37,819
and we'll give it a few minutes

429
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,820
to settle

430
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,720
d

431
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:57,059
the boys sterilizing your instruments in

432
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,159
between use now we're gonna remove this

433
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:02,279
old bouquet here

434
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,480
take it over to our disposal tub

435
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,119
which you know if you're into the

436
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,980
natural farming you know this is just

437
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,319
your Dom here

438
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,679
and I'm gonna Mist it as I put it in

439
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:16,619
there because there's pollen on the jar

440
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,720
give a little rinse

441
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:21,239
let's see and I was right that was a

442
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,779
coffee seed bun those coffees just dump

443
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,779
pulling

444
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:32,179
and then um this coffee F6 seed Lot B

445
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,460
now we're gonna remove our tray very

446
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:41,600
carefully always taking a take a big

447
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,600
breath in and hold it

448
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:54,619
that is Kate

449
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:09,980
and before I touch anything I get out my

450
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,980
jar

451
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,299
get out

452
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,558
silica packet don't skimp on your silica

453
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,119
packets you know

454
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,819
make sure you get a good one because

455
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,699
that's going to protect your pollen

456
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:30,439
and your Harvest and prevent it from

457
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,440
caking if it's not quite dry

458
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,360
coffee F6 c-line

459
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:47,359
B

460
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,720
and then

461
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:58,139
and you know the reason some people use

462
00:24:54,659 --> 00:25:01,520
like a would run this through a sift

463
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:05,900
I just use a couple cards so very

464
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,900
carefully remove the plant material

465
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:09,479
um

466
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,940
just because they're easy to clean and

467
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,240
dry in between uses because you know

468
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,440
I'll do 10 boxes in a row or 15 boxes in

469
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,019
a row and

470
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,440
uh

471
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:23,819
so I'm just very light pressure here

472
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,740
in my hand

473
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:28,278
and it's just removing the plant

474
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,278
material

475
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,080
now I'll bring the plant material over

476
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:50,240
the area that I scrape

477
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,240
and this is a lot of Pawn

478
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:01,619
and yeah I mean if you wanted to you

479
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,559
could run this material through a sieve

480
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:08,119
but I mean this is going to be more than

481
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,119
more pollen than you're going to need

482
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,179
or you could even take this material put

483
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,120
it into

484
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,400
a bag or a pollen

485
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,658
sleeve and put that around a plant and

486
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,700
use that dry material that we're

487
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:26,480
scraping off the table there to make a

488
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,480
branch of seeds

489
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,379
I know I've seen some people do that

490
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,460
Tech I know forest with sunroots uses

491
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,260
that Tech

492
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,259
but they put the bag over the plant

493
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:44,839
it's definitely a safe way

494
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,839
to make seeds in your flower garden

495
00:26:51,900 --> 00:27:00,419
and then I usually store this pollen

496
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:03,119
you know in a cool dry dark room

497
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:06,600
why I'm using it for the pollination

498
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:10,859
season and then I put it into single use

499
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,980
jars and into the freezer

500
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:12,979
um

501
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,159
for long-term use

502
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:23,778
pollen's only viable for about 20

503
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,778
minutes after it thaws

504
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,159
also if your plant material was totally

505
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,038
dry

506
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,960
you wouldn't need to separate it

507
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:53,460
from your pollen

508
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,319
you know just in case there's any

509
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,278
moisture in here and just for you know

510
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:58,278
for long-term storage

511
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:13,798
and then when I do my single use jars

512
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:15,599
for the freezer I do

513
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:17,940
take apart a silica packet and I put

514
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:21,899
silver packets in the little jars with

515
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:24,778
the pollen and

516
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,419
in the vacuum seal the jars into a

517
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:29,960
vacuum seal bag with more moisture

518
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,960
protectors

519
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:34,200
you know

520
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:37,500
because of the work involved in pollen

521
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,659
collection and preservation

522
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,859
I really want to make sure that you're

523
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:43,100
going to be able to use that pollen

524
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:43,099
again

525
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,860
and a lot of that work is the risk

526
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,299
involved

527
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:50,538
because most people are also growing

528
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:50,538
flowers

529
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:10,939
okay fucking

530
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,359
pretty clean

531
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,360
now we're gonna

532
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,959
and you're gonna get the the money shot

533
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,960
here as we get this in the jar

534
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,278
that is

535
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:01,798
a lot of yellow cake remember

536
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,220
but no not actual radioactive material

537
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:04,220
pollen

538
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:11,179
thank you

539
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:14,479
[Applause]

540
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,340
yeah it's my current one in an old one

541
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,759
they're nice like the thin card on that

542
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:49,759
you know

543
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,839
all right

544
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:07,639
and then I got a

545
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,639
very wet rag here

546
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,100
foreign

547
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:41,038
do the same thing to the

548
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,039
the pollen boxes spray and why

549
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:48,019
there is a lot of pollen

550
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:52,099
and this material left on the table

551
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:52,099
so really get it wet

552
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,980
that sometimes when you even stream it

553
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:03,620
like pollen will come up so it's nice to

554
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,620
like have a mister and a little stream

555
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:16,819
see that there's still some dust still

556
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,819
kicking up

557
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,340
