1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,040
[Music]

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,199
[Music]

3
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:20,480
since we're talking about legalization

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,118
and before I introduce the panel members

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,480
I do want to say that I think we want to

6
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:25,480
have a working definition of

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,118
legalization and when I talk about

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,800
legalization and I'll ask the panelists

9
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,599
to stick with me on this I'm talking

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
about the ability of a human being in

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,799
the state of California to use cannabis

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,679
without any fear of arrest or

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,159
prosecution by the government okay

14
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:40,759
that's what I'm talking about about

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,640
legalization now the second part of

16
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:44,280
legalization which is a lot of what

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,160
everyone's talking about it is here

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,280
today is how does that look like in

19
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,479
terms of creating the product and

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,280
distributing the product okay but when

21
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,439
we talk about legalization we're

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,760
fundamentally talking about no one

23
00:00:54,439 --> 00:01:00,079
should be arrested and prosecuted for

24
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:02,159
using this substance someone like Bruce

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,519
margan has been dedicated 40 some OD

26
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,679
years to defending people and and and

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,118
the attorneys like myself and Bruce are

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,600
adamant that this has to end so that's

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,200
what legalization is and that's what we

30
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:16,079
mean okay now uh to my left Dale

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,118

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,879

District 2 which goes from Santa Barbara

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,439
cuts the state in the middle and goes

40
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:37,039
all the way up to the Oregon border and

41
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:40,719
she has been an outspoken advocate for

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,479
the state to get their shit together and

43
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:48,359
make this work okay I'm on film I think

44
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:50,399
um Jeff raber uh uh is uh PhD uh put

45
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,560
together um an incredible business

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,079
called a workshop and law enforcement

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
was very excited about his business to

48
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,758
and arrested and raided it a few months

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,640
ago uh I don't think it was arrested but

50
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,399
you might have been arrested

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,759
yeah so we're still here you know it's

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,960
like the end you know uh uh someone uh I

53
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,038
think it was Ken Coy was talking about

54
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,199
the end of World War II the end of of

55
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,519
Wars are nasty times you know end World

56
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,039
War II Japanese kamakazi Pilots the

57
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,959
Germans at the Battle of the Bulge you

58
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,878
know they go in and they they they wreak

59
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,560
havoc because they're losing and they're

60
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,239
vindictive and that's what we're dealing

61
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,039
with we're going to see more arrests

62
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,120
more prosecution by state authorities

63
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,840
over the next two years until this thing

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,360
three years until this gets sorted out

65
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,000
so be careful out there and

66
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,200
unfortunately Jeff really learned that

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,598
hard way Amanda Ryman is now the

112
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,359

00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:25,120
Supervisors from 2002 to 2006 um in San

114
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,759
Francisco like we didn't really talk

115
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,560
about uh cannabis I mean it was more

116
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,400
about how can patients access it better

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,280
how do we you know ensure that um you

118

00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,399
Emerald Triangle along with assembly

123
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,560
member Jim Wood and Luke Bruner uh found

124
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,719

Luke and talk to me about many of the

130
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,478
issues that are facing this industry and

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,319
I was honestly quite shocked um I did

132
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:15,360
not know um all of these kind of issues

133
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,360
you know the raids and the banking and

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,400
the transportation and um just you know

135
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,560
tracking and and all of that and so we

136
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,918
started my office and I started on kind

137
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,280
of an 8mon uh cannabis 101 learning

138
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,399
listening tour just for ourselves and I

139
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,239
just want introduce my staff who's been

140
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:37,399
here we go on every tour we just got

141
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,319
back from 12 meetings in 48 hours in

142
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:44,519
Colorado yesterday um and so I want to

143
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,520
introduce Seth doton he handles my

144
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,680
Agriculture and as Tony said this is

145
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:55,918
agriculture so Seth is the expert I have

146
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:58,400
Tim Morin he handles my legislation in

147
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,079
Sacramento and then Genevie japa is

148
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,959
based out of my San Francisco go off as

149
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,959
my district director and handles all my

150
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,080
Outreach and so again the one thing that

151
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,720
I think uh that impacts everyone in this

152
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,120
industry is the lack of access to Banks

153
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,800
or credit unions and I can't even

154
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,639
imagine like every day every week having

155
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,879
to go around and get Cashers checks uh

156
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,960
to pay for employee taxes to have to go

157
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:31,478
pay all of your bills uh one by one you

158
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,719
know in cash your utilities your rents

159
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:35,918
your um I mean it is just maddening to

160
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,120
me and that you know cannot use an

161
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,918
electronic transfer you cannot use a

162
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,879
check yet the IRS and the Franchise Tax

163
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:45,839
Board they say no cash allowed right so

164
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,560
how are you supposed to pay your taxes

165
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,318
and then we also found out at the Board

166
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,280
of Equalization that we used to have a

167
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,840
no cash policy as well until we you know

168
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,279
are authorized to collect sales tax how

169
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,959
do you collect sales tax from an

170
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,478
industry who cannot have a bank account

171
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:06,000
and so this really started me on my kind

172
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:09,800
of passion to figure out how we can um

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,800
Bank um this industry because it is just

174
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,598
maddening that there is so much cash out

175
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,439
there and the fact that you all can't um

176
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:19,839
access banking just like normal

177
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,160
Americans is really kind of unamerican

178
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,560
to me um so we've been working on this

179
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,680
uh obviously we've been pushing the

180
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,519
federal government um you know there is

181
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,199
a bill right now HR

182
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,240
2076 um many of the legislators have

183
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,079
signed on but it's kind of stuck as we

184
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,840
all know the federal government I don't

185
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,878
think is going to be um dealing with

186
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,519
this issue this year or next year is

187
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,879
kind of the consensus um in the meantime

188
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,318
you know the co memo and the uh finson

189
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,280
guidelines came out and um it's

190
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,598
difficult for banks to bank this

191
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,519
industry but it's not impossible and we

192
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:56,120
just got back from Colorado and there

193
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:58,399
are six banks that are out so to speak

194
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,598
um that said hey we do want to bank this

195
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,120
industry they're working with software

196
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,839
uh providers to provide better due

197
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,199
diligence and hopes that The Regulators

198
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:09,638
are going to um allow them to continue

199
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,400
to bank and I think California banks and

200
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,199
Credit Unions the Community Banks and

201
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,679
Credit Union should be uh looking into

202
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,240
these technology platforms to do more

203
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,959
Banking and to take on you know this um

204
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,759
this industry um we also have an

205
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,758
opportunity you know passing the three

206
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,520
bills that we passed um at the

207
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,680
legislature you know to see what we can

208
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:35,838
do also uh to try to you know allow

209
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,478
Banking and sem member wood um also has

210
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,399
a bill AB

211
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,320
15409 15

212
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:48,799
1589 15 1549 um that he uh just put over

213
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,720
the desk the last night of session um

214
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:54,799
which is going to uh look to create a

215
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,440
state chartered Credit Union within the

216
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,439
State Board of Equalization

217
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,000
and so we figure the State Board of

218
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,640
legalization has been collecting taxes

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,559
sales taxes legally uh for the last 20

220
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,799
years and you know states are um exempt

221
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,919
I guess from the money laundering laws

222
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,039
and so we've been doing this why can't

223
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,679
we you know increase our capabilities at

224
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,879
the state level at least provide the

225
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,359
basic Merchant banking right paying your

226
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,159
taxes electronic transfers you know that

227
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,759
kind of stuff um so I member wood and I

228
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:33,360
are going to be working very very hard

229
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:35,278
over the next four months um and then we

230
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,680
are going to go into official committee

231
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:40,159
hearings when the legislature comes back

232
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,799
uh in um in January so those are things

233
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,879

237
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,599
going to be a big Market if we legalize

238
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,839
there's enough room for everyone in this

239
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,079

245
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,838

246
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:20,679

them they're they've been really great

251
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,519
does anyone on the panel have any any

252
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,040
kind of followup or comments about Bank

253
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,959
or taxes that they want to make the

254
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,759
driving point because I I'll keep moving

255
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,759
this along um

256
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,480
Dale we've got AB 266 243 643 what is

257
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:49,120
going to happen in November of

258
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,879
2016 the language will drop in the next

259
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,720
two weeks we're told sooner sooner one

260
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:58,600
from uh reform California another one

261
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,480
from another group uh maybe maybe one

262
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,159
what's going to happen happen does this

263
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,600
bill that we saw is that going to become

264
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:08,039
relevant in the future or is is the

265
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,839
legalization initiative going to wipe

266
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,159
out all the medical cannabis regulations

267
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,839
what's what's your view of how this is

268
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,439
going to play out well uh that's a good

269
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:21,519
question um I think we should look at AB

270
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:25,279
266 as a starting point uh for the next

271
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,639
year to uh get the the Machinery going

272
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,600
and to get people in the industry

273
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,320
involved with the various State agencies

274
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,839
that they need to get involved with and

275
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,720
the various State agencies in in

276
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:41,120
position where they can actually deal

277
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,040
with the businesses um after that uh of

278
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,679
course any initiative is going to take

279
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:53,639
effect on uh November 9th uh

280
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:57,519
2016 and uh I think what you'll see is a

281
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:00,759
another sort of broader kind of

282
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,320
framework for General cannabis

283
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:08,000
legalization proposed that will sort of

284
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:13,079
fit like a large glove over AB 266 and

285
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:17,120
allow AB 266 to evolve into something

286
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:19,679
else uh there's going to be a lot more

287
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,600
legislation and a lot of Regulation

288
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:26,638
legalization is a longterm project um

289
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,480
it's it's going to be going I mean look

290
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,079
at prop 215 that's been 20 years and

291
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,519
we're still working on it uh it's going

292
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:39,838
to be 20 years and more that we're

293
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:41,959
working on uh these regulations for

294
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,920
cannabis is anybody else on the panel

295
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,879
want to just sort of follow up on Dale's

296
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,439
uh comments or any thoughts you've had

297
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,958
about how this is going to play out I I

298
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,279
keep telling everyone that I think that

299
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:55,278
once the initiative passes that this set

300
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,958
of bills uh regardless of all the work

301
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,679
and time and energy that went into it is

302
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,479
going to become largely irrelevant and

303
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,838
that the key language that I plan to

304
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,560
advise my clients on is the initiative

305
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,600
language and that that I'm going to be

306
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,838
transitioning them getting ready for

307
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,000
that as opposed to as opposed to this

308
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,920
Cal normal however would advise

309
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,600
everybody in the industry to look

310
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:20,399
seriously now at complying with AB 266

311
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,360
if you want to have a be a step ahead of

312
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,759
everybody else because people who are

313
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,560
compliant with AB 266 are definitely

314
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:30,120
going to be at the head of the line as

315
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:32,000
we move Beyond to 2016 and I we've

316
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,000
certainly been telling everybody every

317
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,559
grower and everybody uh you know with a

318

00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,919
dispensary owners um and the people who

330
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,480
were in The Market already actually got

331
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:14,799
first dibs into legalization so that's

332
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,199
correct and and we also saw that the tax

333
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,278
for medical can patient in Colorado 7%

334
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,758
versus the adult use or I use the word

335
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,159
adult use uh rather than recreational is

336
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,159
31% I believe so that's and you're

337
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,480
seeing a huge and gets back to Tony's

338
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,240
point about Market distortions you're

339
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,720
seeing a huge number of people still

340
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,159
getting doctor's recommendations going

341
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,879
into the the retail brick and mortar

342
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:37,078
places where you can both go as a

343
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,838
patient or as just a consumer but you'll

344
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:44,559
pay more taxes uh and and that does

345
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,680
create some distortions um Jeff rber um

346
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,838
you you're you a brave man you've uh

347
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:53,519
you're encountering the the the the the

348
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,120
Last gasps of a Dying regime uh and and

349
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,759
we should all applaud you for for

350
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,480
standing up in front and and taking it

351
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,639
and moving forward so I really really

352
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,480
want to acknowledge that uh for you and

353
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:06,079
for everyone else who's encountered law

354
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,839
enforcement and and and I and I have to

355
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,159
really watch my language in public about

356
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,399
this but it's it's really a tragedy what

357
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,559
what we're still seeing out there and

358
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,278
it's not ending it's not ending and as a

359
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,479
lawyer I can promise you and Bruce and

360
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:19,679
the other lawyers in the room will tell

361
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,440
you it's not ending uh not it's not

362
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,519
going to end until we we finally you

363
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,600
know Drive the last nail on the coffin

364
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,318
but you know we have a a a statute in

365
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,759
California called the health and safety

366
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:34,159
code section 11379.6 which says that you

367
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:38,039
cannot through any method chemically

368
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:40,719
extract from Cannabis and my chemists

369
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,919
who I cont contact with tell me that

370
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,680
everything you do that to cannabis is

371
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:46,958
chemical extraction whether it's smoking

372
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,278
it putting it in water extracting it

373
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,278
using CO2 extraction using butane

374
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:52,759
extraction and that fundamentally what

375
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,958
the legislature was trying to do with

376
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,360
that extraction statute was to prohibit

377
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:00,599
dangerous activities the bill that was

378
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,639
just passed has a license six and a

379
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,000
license seven for manufacturing which is

380
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,399
really extraction license six is for a

381
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,679
nonvolatile solvent I I don't understand

382
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,600
are solvent can a solvent be

383
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,519
nonvolatile yeah okay and then you have

384
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,399
depends on your definition okay so that

385
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,720
and that is the whole problem that we

386
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,078
have with all of it let me let me get

387
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,920
right there with you and then a type

388
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,359
seven which is the only license type

389
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:24,559
that was specifically uh shows in the

390
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,240
statute as being they're going to have

391
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,000
limitations to it I didn't quite

392
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,079
understand why they did that may maybe

393
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,679
the assembly men's uh the assembly men

394
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,799
uh who are here can explain that to us

395
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:37,000
but the type seven will be for volatile

396
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,120
solvents which are like butane and those

397
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,318
will be allowed but

398
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,318
limited what's going to happen to the

399
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:45,759
extraction industry as we move towards

400
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:47,958
legalization where do you see this all

401
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,120
going it will get much more

402
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,439
sophisticated but it will like where it

403
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,919
will actually go and what we're allowed

404
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,759
to do depends on the definitions so for

405
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,519
20 years we've had no definition of what

406
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,240
you're allowed to do in California and

407
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,159
that's created all the problems that you

408
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,879
see and certainly why we're kind of

409
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,759
caught up in that machine um and the

410
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:08,359
next step will be what is that important

411
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,838
definition of volatile so as you ask

412
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,279
many different chemists you know

413
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,159
different terms May mean different

414
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,959
things to different perspectives when

415
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,160
you have lawmakers who are not educated

416
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,720
in chemistry trying to set definitions I

417
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,480
often see cannabinoid defined improperly

418
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,558
even cannabis may be defined improperly

419
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,038
um that is the key fundamental piece of

420
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,558
any legislation or any law which is

421
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,720
those definitions so definition such as

422
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:33,839
independent or what a distributor could

423
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,600
or couldn't do what volatile means or

424
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,918
doesn't mean or what really are going to

425
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,759
be important pieces of the regulations

426
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,679
and that will Define who's doing which

427
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:45,038
part or not so you know water is that

428
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:47,038
going to be volatile or not volatile

429
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,480
alcohol how what you know alcohol is

430
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,400
definitely volatile so which types is it

431
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,839
set by boiling point is it a long

432
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,120
definition of every type of chemical we

433
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,678
don't know what those things are yet

434
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,519
today but that will definitely Define

435
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,120
who's allowed to do what and I think you

436
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,879
will see see great deal of scrutiny in

437
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,479
terms of your methodologies how your

438
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,480
cleaning procedures are done your

439
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,440
standard operating procedures your

440
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,640
building codes your equipment being

441
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,200
certified by engineering stamps and

442
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,600
everything that a processor is going to

443
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,600
do is be highly highly scrutinized in

444
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,319
terms of safety cleanliness and

445
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:20,319
operating procedures so it will move

446
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,558
much towards GMP production good

447
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,839
manufacturing practice and most

448
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,399
definitely will not be allowed to be

449
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:29,558
done in your backyard anymore my my

450
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,080
clients my clients in Colorado

451
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,798
um have learned over the years that they

452
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,558
have to spend a lot of money on

453
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:38,558
lobbyists and people who can work with

454
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:40,918
the legislature and Regulators uh have

455
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,240
you met with any uh of the legislators

456
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,759
or do you have a plan going forward to

457
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,798
get involved in the regulatory

458
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,279
rulemaking process that if the governor

459
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,200
signs this bill will then ensue

460
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,599
hopefully when he signs it yes we will

461
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,400
be involved um I've done that in five

462
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,000
different states so far to help State

463
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,919
Regulators really understand their

464
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,079
definitions understand you know what

465
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,679
testing means what manufacturing means

466
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,359
how this plant could be handled and I'm

467
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,240
certainly very anxious to get involved

468
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:09,959
in California to the greatest possible

469
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:14,319
extent that I can you know um William

470
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:18,480
wre you go by William or Bill or will um

471
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:21,038
has a um also has a company that uh does

472
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,120
a lot of work in the Cannabis sector can

473
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,599
you talk a little bit about where you

474
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,558
see issues such as product testing

475
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:30,119
consumer confidence and even product

476
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:33,558
liability for for product failure going

477
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:35,558
forward in a legalization regime

478
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:37,240
absolutely absolutely I mean uh doing

479
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:40,519
some research a number came out in

480
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,359
research 11.4 billion and that number is

481
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:44,200
not the state or the size of the

482
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:45,399
California medical marijuana Market even

483
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,960
though no one knows that number is it

484
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,720
was actually the five largest uh

485
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,079
pharmaceutical lawsuits for product

486
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,159
liability now just that's just a

487
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,519
staggering number anything you think

488
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,200
about God that could devastate an

489
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:59,519
industry and starting to read through uh

490
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,360
the proposed language for for ab 66 and

491
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,558
looking at how um testing is now become

492
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:05,839
an independent body uh there's been a

493
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,480
lot of companies in the state of

494
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,158
California today that do internal

495
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,159
testing they have full labs they do a

496
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,280
great job on putting out great product

497
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,880
but from a consumer's perspective they

498
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,879
want that independent they want that

499
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,360
third party to come in and confirm that

500
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,280
that product is you know is is

501
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,599
satisfactory you know it's safe they

502
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,918
they know what the potencies are they

503
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,240
know that if it's an edible or a extract

504
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:30,280
there's no residual solvents or they

505
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,599
know what the limits are and it's below

506
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,798
uh acceptable standards um so as the

507
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,359
industry continues to mature and kind of

508
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:39,879
give you a little bit of background with

509
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,639
my company is we assist companies in

510
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,760
multiple States through the legalization

511
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,640
process as Matt said it's how do I as a

512
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,879
business owner stay legal how do I not

513
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,759
get arrested how do I manage my cash how

514
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,240
do I you know handle the complete

515
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:55,038
vertical um so you know we clients in

516
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,400
Maryland Oregon uh pic have now client

517
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,359
in Hawaii which is going to be a great

518
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,840
place to go visit TR I like that client

519
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:02,158
I need need to go visit them a lot um ex

520
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,519
they're not going to let the lawyers

521
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,039
assist them according to the state 18

522
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:07,558
person State Bar committee that just

523
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:10,200
issued an opinion the other day you just

524
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:12,558
can't form their company but um as it

525
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,360
relates to uh testing going forward I

526
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,480
mean there's some conflicting language

527
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:19,839
in a266 whether or not it's to be you

528
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,519
know can the cultivators or the

529
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,759
manufacturers go direct or does it have

530
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,200
to be managed by the distributor I think

531
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,519
as the uh assembly men have said you

532
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,080
know some of that cleanup language is

533
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,679
going to come through you know where is

534
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,199
that process going to be um but we have

535
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,278
to look at it from an industry side we

536
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,919
have to look at it from a consumer

537
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:37,440
safety side specifically with

538
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,080
recreational hopefully right on the

539
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,080
corner you know the recreational

540
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:43,119
Market's going to be looking at is this

541
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:45,399
product safe you know we don't want a

542
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,678
repeat of what happened in colado end of

543
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,880
last year uh you know prob heard of the

544
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,200
livewell scenario where you know some

545
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,720
supposedly non-infused um uh product was

546
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,840
given away at a at a at a trade or at a

547
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,120
a local event you know and I think a

548
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,199
number of people got SI

549
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,639
cuz they thought they were eating you

550
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,400
know non-infused candies um so from a

551
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,759
liability side you know we're just

552
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,559
starting to see some precedents and as a

553
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:10,919
business owner the the biggest concern

554
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,519
is you know we've acknowledged or the

555
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,120
federal government acknowledged in in in

556
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:15,960
the bankruptcy courts you can't declare

557
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,639
bankruptcy so what happens if you get

558
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,558
sued well number one you need to have

559
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,640
great insurance number two you need to

560
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:25,158
ensure that you're doing everything you

561
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,799
can do to communicate to your customer

562
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,120
of you know product issues product

563
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,000
liability issues um

564
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,639
and I'm not an attorney so but basically

565
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,798
we have enough in the room but the

566
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,720
aspect would be is you know making sure

567
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,679
that you're communicating the everything

568
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,120
you need to do from a labeling side from

569
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,480
a product side uh to your consumers so

570
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,079
that you're protected um just a

571
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,319
correction I I've actually put clients

572
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:49,319
in bankruptcy in the sector so at least

573
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,000
out in the ninth circuit we've done that

574
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:53,038
that may be different in Colorado I saw

575
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,240
opinion that there anyone have any

576
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,278
comment on on on on Will's uh uh

577
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,599
statements anyone

578
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:03,119
yeah good I would just like to say

579
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:05,038
whenever there is a bad actor or a bad

580
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,038
situation and there's media that's when

581
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,440
legislators get all worked up cuz then

582
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,158
we feel like we have to go fix it so I

583
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,558
agree with you like to the extent that

584
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,159
you know you're you know labeling you're

585
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,119
warning you're you're you know policing

586
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,360
you know yourself to make sure that

587
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,038
consumers aren't taking you know too

588
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,000
much product you know I like the rookie

589
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,960
cookie in Colorado where they're you

590
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,839
know actually you know educating folks

591
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,360
firsthand like if you don't know you're

592
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,678
not ready don't do it but um those are

593
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,639
kind of the things that will keep you

594
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,080
know the legislators and government out

595
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,080
of this

596
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,600
industry and I would Echo the same thing

597
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,519
I mean all of regulations are really

598
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:46,599
about building a good label for consumer

599
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:48,400
protection and information so all the

600
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,558
testing that's required is to protect

601
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,840
the consumers as well as understand your

602
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:53,839
operational effectiveness and

603
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,119
efficiencies so it's not something that

604
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,678
I should have to do it's something I

605
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,079
want to do for my brand for my business

606
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,798
for all of those people that are going

607
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:02,399
to be impacted by the products and it's

608
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:03,839
really a great sign of responsibility

609
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,798
and something that everyone should

610
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,918
embrace and want to do and as a testing

611
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:09,000
lab for five years no one wanted to do

612
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,640
it because they thought they were going

613
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,319
to be charging themselves you know an

614
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,400
extra cost but it really is a good

615
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,599
investment in your business and it's a

616
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,000
responsibility position that says I care

617
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:19,719
about those who are going to be impacted

618
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,519
by the products they're consuming well

619
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,480
it's pretty clear based on everything

620
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,038
we've heard today so far that there will

621
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,038
be people who will be able to make the

622
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,558
transition and people who won't you know

623
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,038
one of the statistics I like to use is

624
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,278
in 1902 there were 207 car companies in

625
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:36,038
the United States 8 years later in two

626
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:38,679
1910 there were three and I I think

627
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:40,919
everyone is going to have to learn a

628
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:42,640
whole other level of professionalism and

629
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,960
approaching this if they're going to

630
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,559
survive uh Amanda last but not least and

631
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,480
for sure not last but not least because

632
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:52,879
Amanda Ryman and the drug policy

633
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:56,278
Alliance have were you know I always say

634
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,440
that the drug Reform Group like Dale and

635
00:24:56,278 --> 00:25:00,440
Amanda and drug policy Alliance and

636
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,798
other groups brought the ball down to

637
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,360
the 10 yard line and that it's in

638
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:08,200
probably that the business sector is

639
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,240
going to bring it over the goal line

640
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,798
because of the money resources they're

641
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,839
bringing the Republicans into the

642
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,720
discussion I mean they've just done a

643
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:20,079
lot but Amanda's drug policy Alliance

644
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,360
and her energy in doing reform work and

645
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,398
in Pro you know Prop 47 that the drug

646
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,879
policy Alliance did I mean I can't glow

647
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,798
enough about the drug policy Alliance

648
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,440
and about what the work you guys have

649
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:33,079
done I mean really on the ground really

650
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,679
really important work so here we are

651
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:39,000
Amanda we're probably about to legalize

652
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:42,960
marijuana the very thing that that you

653
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,558
have been working for uh and and you

654
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,000
know and and and and there's going to be

655
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:48,480
a lot of work to be done in the next

656
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
year and we all know it's it's going to

657
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,519
get nasty and dirty out there there's no

658
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,119
question about it and we're all I'm

659
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,679
rolling up my sleeves and you know we

660
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,918
know we've talked about the plans that

661
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:59,840
were things we're doing what's going to

662
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,640
happen to your work after legalization

663
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,000
where where will you be your focus what

664
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,000
will the reformers and the folks

665
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,119
concerned with social justice issues

666
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,240
what what will you be

667
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:13,278
doing retiring in Hawaii

668
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,240
yeah um no I think that's a really good

669
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,798
question you know I was at the Cannabis

670
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,399
business World cannabis World Congress

671
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:21,759
uh last week also down here in Los

672
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:24,199
Angeles and really remarking about how

673
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,319
things have changed in just a very very

674
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,519
short amount of time in terms of who

675
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,079
attends these things the type of booths

676
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:31,278
see I mean there was a time when you

677
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,398
would come to these events and the

678
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,480
booths were all either how to grow pot

679
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:38,278
without anyone knowing how to pass a

680
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,759
drug test or hemp clothing and pipes I

681
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:42,960
mean that was the booths at these events

682
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:44,359
and now it's really changed um but I

683
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,440
want to take a step back for a minute

684
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:47,278
because you know a lot of what we've

685
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,320
talked about on this panel has to do

686
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,880
with that second part of that two-part

687
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,678
definition of legalization and we focus

688
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,640
on that a lot I mean because as you said

689
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,480
you know maybe that's what's going to

690
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,278
bring us over the goal line right is

691
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,480
this idea of the actual industry that

692
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:02,880
this will create and the money that

693
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,558
comes along with it however there was a

694
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,159
lot of marijuana selling and purchasing

695
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:10,720
and consuming going on in this state

696
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,760
long before we ever even had the idea

697
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,360
that it could become a lit industry and

698
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,960
so as we move now to this idea of

699
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:23,000
legalization we have to think about how

700
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,679
our history of drug prohibition and the

701
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,798
War on Drugs is going to negatively

702
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,360
impact this industry for certain

703
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:31,599
individual uals and that it's not okay

704
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:33,240
for that not to be part of the

705
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,719
discussion that always has to be part of

706
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,720
the discussion so what I wanted to do

707
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,798
here with my brief time is share some

708
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,880
information with you um to kind of let

709
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,679
you know why it's really important to

710
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,000
advocate for things like not barring

711
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,519
people with criminal histories from

712
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,960
getting into the industry by advocating

713
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,079
for policies that are expunge records

714
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,558
let people out of jail make sure that

715
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,759
they're not barred from getting jobs

716
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,359
that they're not barred from getting

717
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,759
housing that their children aren't being

718
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,798
taken away I mean these are very serious

719
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,038
issues and let's face it they don't

720
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:03,918
affect everybody equally and looking

721
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:07,398
around the room they don't affect too

722
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:11,000
many of us so I wanted to make this

723
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:13,079
point uh DPA and the ACLU we did a study

724
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,519
looking at who's getting in trouble for

725
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:18,079
infractions uh marijuana infractions in

726
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,120
California as we know in 2011 January

727
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,000
1st possession of less than an ounce

728
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:24,759
became an infraction in California

729
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,679
punishable by up to a $100 fine similar

730
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:29,480
to a parking ticket before this happened

731
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,640
though we still saw racial disparities

732
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,360
and who was getting trouble for

733
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,519
marijuana so when possession was a

734
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:36,959
misdemeanor we saw you know 6.6% of the

735
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,599
population in California's

736
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,519
African-American they make up 177% of

737
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,879
the folks getting misdemeanors so that's

738
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,319
before we even went to an infraction

739
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,760
then we go to an infraction and we're

740
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:49,000
like oh well now it's just a parking

741
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:50,839
ticket now it's no big deal well let's

742
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,919
see if what Los Angeles did with their

743
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:56,199
infractions the first year that they had

744
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:58,240
infractions on the record um so in Los

745
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,600
Angeles African-Americans make up about

746
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,038
10% of the population and they receive

747
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:07,119
25% of the marijuana citations now when

748
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:08,879
we go to a town like mine of Oakland

749
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,879
which believe me I'm an evangelist I

750
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,559
love Oakland to death I will say nothing

751
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,760
but good things about them except that

752
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:19,278
in Oakland sorry African-Americans make

753
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:21,720
up 25% of our population and 76% of

754
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:24,079
people that are getting citations for

755
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,640
marijuana possession so even when you

756
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,439
look at a place that you feel is

757
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,880
extremely cannabis friendly we've got

758
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,000
Oaker Dam down the street we're still

759
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,880
seeing this kind of discrimination so

760
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,200
what does this mean for the

761
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,200
industry how many of you think back to

762
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,000
when you were 18 19 years old how many

763
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,319
of you were in the job that you were

764
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,079
going to do for the rest of your life

765
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:45,079
when you were 18 or 19 years old and you

766
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,798
were like this is my career forever and

767
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:48,918
I'm

768
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:50,398
settled right not a lot of us right so

769
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:51,679
the point is that when you're that age

770
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:53,439
you're still trying to figure out who

771
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,080
you are and what you want to be and you

772
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,200
don't even really know what you want to

773
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:00,519
be so here's the kicker when we look at

774
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,360
the average age that people are getting

775
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:06,359
in trouble for marijuana in California

776
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:09,158
it is not the same across racial

777
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:11,918
categories for whites infractions tend

778
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:14,080
to be given to people 34 year old 34

779
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:19,159
years old or older for people of color

780
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:21,519
blacks and Latinos it's 19 years old so

781
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:24,240
here we are creating this awesome

782
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,000
industry with all of this opportunity

783
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,038
and we're going to be cutting out people

784
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,480
that before they're even old enough to

785
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:34,319
bu a drink have been labeled person non

786
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,440
grada in the new legalization industry

787
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,159
of marijuana and that is not okay so

788
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,919
while we can get really

789
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,440
[Applause]

790
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,519
excited about the industry and while we

791
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,720
can utilize the fact that it is bringing

792
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,798
tax revenue which can go to schools and

793
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,038
can go to after school programs and can

794
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:53,519
go to the kind of services we need to

795
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:55,759
bolster communities that have been

796
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,919
targeted by the War on Drugs we have to

797
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,359
make a special attempt to ask ourselves

798
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,639
how is this going to impact the people

799
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,079
who have been most impacted and that's

800
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:06,000
where we should start from because

801
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,519
honestly at the end of the day it's that

802
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,759
first definition we have to take care of

803
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:14,638
before we can ride off into the sunset

804
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:14,638
and pay attention to the second one

805
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:20,879
right comment anyone uh want to comment

806
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,319
on on these issues yeah Dale uh yeah let

807
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,278
me follow up uh on plans after

808
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:29,918
2016 personally I'm going to retire I'm

809
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:34,119
going to be s next year my goal was to

810
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,559
legalize marijuana in California I will

811
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:40,439
have accomplished that hopefully by

812
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:43,918
November 9th 2016 and uh can uh uh uh

813
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,038
relax but normal is going to stay around

814
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,960
because Normal is the National

815
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:51,480
Organization for the reform of marijuana

816
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:55,159
laws and most of the United States will

817
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,759
not have legal marijuana after 2016

818
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:58,799
there's a lot of work to do and as long

819
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:00,519
as it's illegal elsewhere in the United

820
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,879
States there's going to be this great

821
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:05,919
big black market demand that's going to

822
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,080
continue to drive the the pirate Growers

823
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,200
here in California who have been such a

824
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,158
a problem for our environment and

825
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,240
otherwise D you know that that's a

826
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:18,639
really great point you raise is and what

827
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,759
happens when we vote for legalization in

828
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:22,240
2016 to the rest of the country what you

829
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:24,079
know California they say leads the

830
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,638
nation right we we talk about you know

831
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,079
so many things the environmental issues

832
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:29,519
here start here does does it is it going

833
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,558
to is it going to matter that we

834
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,319
legalize in terms of the rest of the

835
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:36,158
country well I think it will yes it will

836
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,759
matter to the politics of the rest of

837
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,840
the country and I was in Mexico and in

838
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:42,919
fact they were saying down there if

839
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:45,278
California legalizes Mexico's got to

840
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,799
legalize because help they're bordering

841
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:48,038
on us what do you think Amanda oh yeah I

842
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,720
think that the implications for

843
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:51,919
California legalizing are way more

844
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,960
International than National I mean

845
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,559
everyone in the country thinks we crazy

846
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,919
so when we pass legalization I don't see

847
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,398
like other states being like well

848
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,759
California does that we want to be like

849
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:02,918
them I mean I think it does create

850
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,359
momentum but I think it's more about you

851
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,399
know having an economy as large as ours

852
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,678
having legalization when other countries

853
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:11,278
smaller than ours want to legalize but

854
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,798
aren't able because of the single treaty

855
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,960
on narcotic drugs which is going to be

856
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,480
discussed next year and so I think for

857
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,639
the very first time the discussion is

858
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,880
going to be do we just take marijuana

859
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:22,678
out of the list of drugs that countries

860
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,000
aren't allowed to legalize and if that

861
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,840
happens which I think California

862
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,599
legalizing will be a big impetus for

863
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,839
that you're going to see Mexico I mean

864
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:32,599
lots of countries that have wanted to do

865
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,079
this but haven't just because we've said

866
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,439
no and we're the seventh or eighth

867
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,158
largest economy and that that's what

868
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,519
you're saying matters Fiona so I just

869
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,919
wanted to add my my office passed me a

870
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,638
little note asking to explain the

871
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,038
difference between the initiative

872
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:46,839
process versus the legislative process

873
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,480
and we're talking about legislative

874
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:53,079
process and I just want to give a shout

875
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,798
out to Hezekiah Allen uh and and um um

876
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:58,000
uh M Jamie Kerr who have been you know

877
00:33:55,798 --> 00:34:00,679
roaming the halls in Sacramento

878
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,159
educating uh the elected officials and

879
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:04,679
they've been doing a great job as well

880
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,360
as Matt and can uh California Cannabis

881
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,480
voice but when we pass legislation at

882
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,960
the state

883
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,320
level legislators can change the

884
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:18,199
legislation at the state level so if you

885
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,639
know 266 you know we passed it they

886
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:21,358
don't think it's working they can go

887
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,119
back and they can change it internally

888
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:26,039
within the body when we go to an

889
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,079
initiative process once we pass it by

890
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:30,918
initiative the only way we can change it

891
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,519
is to go back to the

892
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:35,358
voters so that's a big difference

893
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,239
between what happens in Sacramento and

894
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:39,039
what happens Statewide and that's why I

895
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,918
think Matt's saying you know depending

896
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,719
on what's in the initiative the

897
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,078
initiative trumps what happens at the

898
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,598
state level so the legislature could

899
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,240
actually pass legalization we wouldn't

900
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:50,079
have to go to a voter initiative right

901
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,799
isn't that how that works assembly men

902
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,560
would you ready to take that what why

903
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,879
don't you just right right let's just do

904
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,000
that right so it isn't it is important

905
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,159
that everybody ways in with your

906
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,719
legislators you know with the initiative

907
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,719
writers you know op EDS whatever it can

908
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:07,679
be because I'm just telling you you know

909
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:10,399
coming from San Francisco I did not

910
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:13,279
realize all the issues and if I don't

911
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,440
realize the issues forget about like

912
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,760
everybody else that's you know um you

913
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,480
know in in public service so I just want

914
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,359
to encourage everyone to do as much as

915
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,960
you can to go and be friend offer your

916
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,000
card go in meets you know offer you know

917
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,480
ask him to come on a tour because it has

918
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,519
made a huge huge difference to like me

919
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,199
and my team and how we view this whole

920
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:35,400
industry and what we need to do as

921
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:39,358
public servants let me let me turn now

922
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,920
it's now September 26

923
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:44,358
2025 10 years from now we've legalized

924
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,800
marijuana in

925
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:50,440
California what what do what does that

926
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,920
look like out here anyone anyone can

927
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,800
give me a little you know I've been

928
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,960
through this before 20 years ago when we

929
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,119
did prop 215 and I remember when it was

930
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:03,079
coming down and I knew it was going to

931
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:04,720
win but I knew that I had no idea at all

932
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,240
what it was going to be like the next

933
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:10,159
day and I and and I really did not I

934
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:15,078
mean the dust is still settling from

935
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:18,960
that meteor uh so uh you know I think it

936
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:20,440
would there's no way to to speculate at

937
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,240
this point what it's going to be like

938
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,440
but let's do concentrate on November

939
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:28,759
2016 and take it one step at a time

940
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,639
anyone uh thanks for the advice is

941
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,960
anyone I I like

942
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:35,199
speculating forecasting is has been

943
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,800
essential for my practice of law for the

944
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,000
last 15 years my clients want to say

945
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,039
what's going to happen next what is it

946
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,800
going to look like anyone anyone have a

947
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,039
well I mean I hope we have a much bigger

948
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,720
broader solid base of knowledge about

949
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:47,480
cannabis how it can impact different

950
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:48,959
people how you can guide them to the

951
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,358
right products because we know more

952
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,880
about the plant what it offers people's

953
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:54,039
physiology and interaction with the

954
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,400
plant and how we can create

955
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,239
professionalized standardized

956
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,920
reproducible products for those specific

957
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:00,799
Al in that fashion and that they might

958
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,480
even teach yes no thank you they might

959
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,880
even teach what the endocannabinoid

960
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,838
system is in medical schools which they

961
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,599
don't do yeah Amanda um well I would

962
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,920
like to see cannabis regulated like

963
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,280
alcohol and what I mean when I say that

964
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,119
is that I would like it to be just as

965
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,440
easy for me to go out with my friends

966
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,920
and consume cannabis out in the world as

967
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,599
it is for me to consume alcohol out in

968
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:25,240
the world yeah that may take 10 years

969
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,160
yeah good well well yeah I I do agree

970
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:29,078
with her Amanda I mean if we look at 10

971
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:30,920
years now we want to see the Tipping

972
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:32,200
Point you know I know you talk about

973
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,318
International but we still got to think

974
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,480
National and down and focus on what does

975
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,119
normal need to do nationally to get all

976
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,960
of these states one of the things we've

977
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,680
seen from our perspective is as new

978
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,800
codes are coming out you know Colorado

979
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:46,598
Washington laid down the foundation now

980
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,400
with Oregon and Maryland and other

981
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:50,000
states you know there there's a lot of

982
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,318
best practicing and Fiona just went to

983
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Colorado and looked at banking what's

984
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:54,679
going on there so what I think we're

985
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,800
going to see is once California's regs

986
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:58,799
are done whether it's ab66 is the final

987
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,680
one or the recreational RS that come

988
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,519
following and the procedures that behind

989
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:04,318
that is other states now have a

990
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:06,480
blueprint in which they can just pass

991
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:08,679
and roll in you know they can keep their

992
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,119
government costs at a lower point and

993
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:12,639
they can immediately roll out and start

994
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:14,760
recognizing that tax revenue um and you

995
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,159
know from a 20125 I mean we really want

996
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,800
to see interstate commerce I mean if we

997
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:18,960
really look at I mean I'm right now

998
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,400
originally from Southern California

999
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,039
living in Las Vegas I look at indoor

1000
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,318
grows in Las Vegas they're they're

1001
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,719
tremendously costly operations and

1002
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:28,759
they're inefficient we need to be

1003
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,159
relying on that California Cannabis that

1004
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,280
could be shipped Interstate you know

1005
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,118
from Sami and Menina homeo County the

1006
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,400
Emerald Triangle you know we got to get

1007
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:38,440
to the point where we see interstate

1008
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:41,599
commerce where we can keep efficiencies

1009
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,760
abroad and keep this business going

1010
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,519
strong yeah if you want to you had

1011
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,200
something or you want to well I mean

1012
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,480
it's taken 20 years for us to regulate

1013
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:52,559
215 and even then I don't

1014
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,400
know what's what's really going to

1015
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,799
happen right um because it's you know

1016
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,440
just a framework but there's no de uh

1017
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,760
details the devils are in the details

1018
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,159
and I would just encourage you know um

1019
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,720
all of you who have been operating in

1020
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,759
this Sphere for the last 20 years and

1021
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:11,519
doing what you think has been the right

1022
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,640
thing kudos for the industry but we have

1023
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,679
not been Reinventing the wheel you've

1024
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,598
been using like standards that have been

1025
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:22,199
used by the federal government the state

1026
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,160
the international um community so I

1027
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:26,598
would hope that our legislature does not

1028
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,759
go back and try to reinvent all the

1029
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,760
standards for for all of the different

1030
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,160
you know industries that are in here

1031
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,040
because you guys have been using

1032
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:37,118
established standards and it's been

1033
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,880
working and and everyone just needs to

1034
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,240
step forward and not be afraid to come

1035
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,039
and talk to the legislators who are very

1036
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:45,838
interested in hearing more about this um

1037
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,119
I think maybe we have time for one or

1038
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,400
two questions anyone have anything uh

1039
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,400
yes uh Mickey actually could could you

1040
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,200
stand

1041
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:58,318
up uh Mickey Norris has been an advocate

1042
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:02,799
for cannabis legalization for I think 40

1043
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:04,838
years now since 89 89 88 and as a dear

1044
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,200
friend with her husband Chris Conrad and

1045
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:08,039
Chris has been testifying around the

1046
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:09,919
state trying to keep a lot of our our

1047
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,679
friends and colleagues out of jail and

1048
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,318
so a real Round of Applause actually to

1049
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:17,199
you and your husband uh you know I mean

1050
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:19,199
this is this is we we're this is a

1051
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,519
celebration beginning despite the war

1052
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:22,519
that's still out there and the

1053
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:25,159
skirmishing and the islands that are

1054
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:27,000
they described earlier that uh uh you

1055
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:29,239
know there's so much that people like

1056
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,079
you did did and Dale and and Bruce I

1057
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:32,799
mean this is a real celebration we're

1058
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,560
we're getting we're we're winning we're

1059
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,079
winning it's just taking time to finish

1060
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,920
it off good your question okay to me

1061
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:42,318
legalization isn't complete until

1062
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,760
cannabis

1063
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:48,960
consumers enjoy all the our equal rights

1064
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,319
the same as everybody else in society

1065
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:57,318
including our you know rights to have

1066
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:59,159
our family a right to work um all to

1067
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:01,838
receive the benefits of society that

1068
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:04,399
everybody else does and I'd like to see

1069
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:07,400
some Protections in initiatives or

1070
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,960
legislation do you see that coming down

1071
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,318
I mean with the with legalization will

1072
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:16,119
hopefully come the end of stigmatization

1073
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:17,639
that that has perpetuated prohibition

1074
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,358
and and all the harms that are

1075
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:22,480
associated with it but to me it's a it's

1076
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:25,400
still a matter of civil rights and and

1077
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,880
we're not done until we have our civil

1078
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,880
rights um one big thing that happens

1079
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,440
when you legalize is that the odor of

1080
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,800
cannabis is no longer probable cause to

1081
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:41,200
suspect a crime which is a huge change

1082
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,720
from where we are now uh so

1083
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:45,879
that's a big uh change for civil

1084
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:47,639
liberties and I I suspect that there's

1085
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,039
going to be some advances for civil

1086
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:54,838
liberties at least for medical patients

1087
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:57,519
uh forthcoming um uh in 2016 too yeah so

1088
00:41:54,838 --> 00:42:00,358
um I also spent six years in the legisl

1089
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,318
before I termed out and the difference

1090
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:04,078
between again the legislative process

1091
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:07,519
and the initiative process in the

1092
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,599
legislative process you have 120 members

1093
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:12,079
uh who are trying to work together to

1094
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,760
try to come to some common usually a

1095
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,160
majority vote when you go to the

1096
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,520
initiative process you can write

1097
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:21,440
anything you want in the initiative

1098
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:24,880
initiative writers can put anything they

1099
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,358
want it does not it is not subject to

1100
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,880
attorney general uh attorney general um

1101
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:33,159
review it is not subject to the

1102
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,280
legislative process review so that's

1103
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:37,078
kind of the good and the bad right the

1104
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,640
bad is that you want to change it you

1105
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:40,559
have to go back to the ballot the good

1106
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,000
is anyone can put anything they want

1107
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,960
like every day will be Fiona Ma's

1108
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,239
birthday and I have to get gifts and if

1109
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,838
the voters pass it then that would be

1110
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,558
the law of the land right that is the

1111
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:51,880
truth of the matter so we really need to

1112
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,599
work all of you need to work with the

1113
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,318
initiative writers to put in all the

1114
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:58,640
things that you think the state should

1115
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:00,920
be doing and just a note you can

1116
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,639
actually put an initiative that certain

1117
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,599
sections of it can be modified by the

1118
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,078
legislature right so you actually do

1119
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,920
have a little bit of a middle ground

1120
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,440
there uh which which we hope to see um

1121
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,599
any other uh questions before we uh

1122
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,000
thank the panelists uh for being with us

1123
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,559
today one more question no yes yeah go

1124
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,059
ahead loud please just speak up I want

1125
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:24,440
to know when it gets

1126
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:26,920
[Music]

1127
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,119
how what you're talking about the 2016

1128
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,119
and initiative once it gets passed and

1129
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,920
we're probably not going to be using

1130
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,838
word dispensaries anymore that's sort of

1131
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,159
a medical term say brick and mortar when

1132
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:39,558
when will the first brick and mortar

1133
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:42,118
state license uh get re uh receive a

1134
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:44,359
license because we already have the

1135
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,240
other dispensaries it'll it'll be about

1136
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:49,400
the middle of 2018 earliest depends

1137
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:52,919
what's in the initi it depends what's in

1138
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,559
the initiative as well you're going to

1139
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,920
see normally in initiatives like this

1140
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:00,519
and and with even with 26 6 there's a

1141
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,880
regulatory rul making process that takes

1142
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:04,199
can take a year year and a half

1143
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,440
depending on how well things how fast

1144
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,199
the government can move and then once

1145
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,760
that is finished they'll issue the

1146
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:11,279
applications they'll start reviewing

1147
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,319
them and then they'll be issuing them

1148
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,079
and I think Dale's right sometime if you

1149
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:17,400
pass it November 2016 you're probably

1150
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:19,359
looking at 2018 before the first license

1151
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,960
would issue yeah so Colorado when they

1152
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:24,440
legalized it took them over a year

1153
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,760
because the legislation said that you

1154
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,318
had to get a local permit before you

1155
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,359
could get a state license and then

1156
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:33,759
everyone kind of sat around going well

1157
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:35,838
who's going to go first and so finally

1158
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,319
right the state had to push and say okay

1159
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:38,480
fine we're going to give you a license

1160
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:40,480
assuming you're going to get a local

1161
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,760
license and then that process took a

1162
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,240
year even for that um for

1163
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,359
them yeah it could it it could depend

1164
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:49,759
plan on two years I want to thank the

1165
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:51,440
panelists if everyone give a round of

1166
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,440
applause for them for thank you very

1167
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,440

1168
