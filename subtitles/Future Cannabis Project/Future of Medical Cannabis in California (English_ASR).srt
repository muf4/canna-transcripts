[Music]

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,050
here we are we're in this new age where

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,970
we're all focused on adult use we're all

4
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,099
focused on licensing we're all focused

5
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:33,570
on getting property and getting

6
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,718
ourselves together so that we have a

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,450
business going forward what seems to be

8
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,420
happening is that medical has kind of

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,040
lost a little bit of oomph and people

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,810
have sort of forgotten about it except

11
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,070
for the couple the sort of the small

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,050
group of people that really want to

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,488
focus only on medical and that's

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,979
wonderful and we're gonna hear from some

15
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:55,229
of them but as a general rule around

16
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,879
this industry I mean it really seems

17
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:59,250
like everyone's focusing on adult use

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,809
and I understand there's there's good

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,390
money potentially attached to that um

20
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,368
but we can't forget that at the end of

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,710
the day this was about our patients and

22
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:09,328
this is about helping people and this

23
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:10,709
was about the technology that's

24
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:12,779
happening and the developments that are

25
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,978
happening on the medical side and so I

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,618
really want to shine a light on that

27
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:19,078
tonight let me introduce them to you rob

28
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:21,539
Rosen heck right here on the end is the

29
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:22,798
founder of Lourdes Jones is anybody in

30
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,599
the room familiar with the brand Lourdes

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,100
Jones if you're not there you go if

32
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,298
you're not you definitely should be they

33
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:28,138
have incredible product we're gonna

34
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,079
learn about it tonight

35
00:01:28,138 --> 00:01:32,908
they have incredible packaging which we

36
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,978
will also talk about tonight and I'm

37
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,689
just really really spectacular and Rob's

38
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,159
just an excellent guy full of so much

39
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:42,118
knowledge so I'm so excited to have you

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,779
thank you rob this man here dr. Jeff

41
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:48,989
chin do you go by doctor all right Jeff

42
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:51,179
Chen is a remarkable man as well he's

43
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,699
incredibly knowledgeable as it comes to

44
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:55,498
medical cannabis he has a group called

45
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,028
the UCLA cannabinoid affinity group

46
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:59,218
which I want to hear a little bit more

47
00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:00,748
about and one of the reasons that I've

48
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:03,208
asked Jeff to be a part of this is

49
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:05,429
because when I first heard him speak I

50
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:08,729
realized that here was a man who could

51
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:10,618
take what is pretty scientific and kind

52
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,420
of can get a little confusing if you're

53
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,949
really not up to speed on on the science

54
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,689
of cannabis and you could break it down

55
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,459
into really digestible bits that the

56
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,500
average person can understand and I find

57
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,790
that very exciting and so thank you

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,949
thank you Jeff for being here too

59
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:23,968
thank you for having me absolutely so I

60
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:25,139
think the first thing I want to do is

61
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:27,449
just give them each a minute to talk

62
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,908
about themselves and their in what they

63
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:33,709
do and why this is important to them so

64
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:36,628
one Rob why don't you start with us I

65
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:41,640
grew up in New York on the East Coast

66
00:02:36,628 --> 00:02:43,590
and I moved to California in 2000 and

67
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,449
became a medical marijuana patient I'd

68
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,120
always been a cannabis user and a

69
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:50,789
cannabis enthusiast so when I arrived in

70
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,139
California I was fascinated that you

71
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:58,548
could become a medical marijuana patient

72
00:02:52,139 --> 00:03:01,469
and use cannabis legally and you know I

73
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:04,319
my knowledge of cannabis at that time

74
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:06,060
was extremely limited

75
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:09,839
you know it's smoked cannabis and I knew

76
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,299
what that did but I didn't know what an

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,090
edible was I didn't know what a topical

78
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:18,810
was I didn't know what sativa was I

79
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,810
didn't know what THC or CBD were those

80
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,969
were all new concepts and

81
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,420
you know I would go to the dispensary

82
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:29,189
and I would try products and it was a

83
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,568
little bit like Russian roulette you

84
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,489
might have this incredible experience

85
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:33,958
with something and you might have this

86
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,050
really terrible experience with

87
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,430
something how many people here had a

88
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:44,880
terrible experience with something yeah

89
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,170
so my background I've done a lot of

90
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,209
different things in my career but I was

91
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,329
a chemistry major and I also went to art

92
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,459
school and I ran a marketing agency and

93
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,350
we worked with food companies and

94
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,229
personal care companies and about four

95
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:00,870
years ago we decided we wanted to create

96
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,909
a cannabis brand that would address all

97
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:07,280
of the things that we didn't see in the

98
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,280
marketplace we wanted something that was

99
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,830
high-end quality transparent safe we

100
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,168
wanted to explain to people what they

101
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,799
were getting when I do it do you mystify

102
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:21,269
cannabis and make it user friendly and

103
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,728
something that you could aspire to there

104
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,728
were lots of people who were catering to

105
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:29,099
the STONER stereotypes and you know

106
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:31,409
associated with Bob Marley and Jerry

107
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,180
Garcia and all that stuff and that

108
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,650
stuff's great and those people who play

109
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,199
it played a critical role in the

110
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,849
legalization movement but there was a

111
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,740
lot of that already out there and there

112
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,289
wasn't stuff that would maybe appeal to

113
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,150
a soccer mom or somebody who would shop

114
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:47,459
at Whole Foods or people who cared about

115
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:49,319
the quality of ingredients and wanted to

116
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,269
understand what they were consuming and

117
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,110
so that was the idea behind Lourdes

118
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:56,788
Jones excellent thank you that's good

119
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,250
Jeff any one tell us a little bit about

120
00:04:56,788 --> 00:05:02,038
you yeah sure so I I grew up born and

121
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,139
raised in Los Angeles and about four

122
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:07,949
years ago I was a medical student UCLA

123
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:10,949
when I saw the CNN documentary by Sanjay

124
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:14,069
Gupta and you know I my mind was kind of

125
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:17,639
opened to how cannabinoids might be

126
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:20,819
useful in epilepsy and what was really

127
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,530
profound for me was me having grown up

128
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,449
in a progressive state like California

129
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:26,788
that had medical marijuana since 1995

130
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,250
being a medical student at a progressive

131
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:31,110
institution like UCLA and if you ask me

132
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,750
the uses of cannabis I would have said

133
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,560
you know pain sleep that's about it and

134
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,449
the more I dug the more I'm

135
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,168
hovering really interesting properties

136
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:40,750
the anti-tumor properties

137
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:42,310
anti-inflammatory antioxidant so now I'm

138
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,300
going around UCLA talking to anybody

139
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,620
they'll listen to me

140
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,870
being like why are we doing research

141
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,930
with this why don't you care about this

142
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,430
and other medical students physicians

143
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,870
had kind of the same reaction again

144
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,100
maybe it's useful for pain and sleep

145
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,790
they didn't really know about all the

146
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,980
other layers so that's when I knew that

147
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,360
by the time that the average citizen or

148
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,919
the average scientist or doctor by the

149
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,210
time they learned about this organically

150
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:06,189
it might not be for decades and that's

151
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:09,430
when I kind of dedicated myself to the

152
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:11,709
cause it was white also around this time

153
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,959
that I entered the MBA portion I was

154
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:16,149
part of a dual degree undie MBA program

155
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,519
at UCLA basically you're trying to Train

156
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:19,989
physicians to run hospitals I'm using my

157
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:26,918
training now to accelerate cannabis

158
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:28,720
research thank you and earlier this year

159
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:30,759
I got a little bit of seed money from

160
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,430
UCLA I created the cannabinoid affinity

161
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,639
group which is a blue sleeo NIH's

162
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,978
interest group who here was that our we

163
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,079
had a symposium at 4:20 on UCLA I think

164
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:43,478
there's a few of us they were here you

165
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,829
were here ok so that's so we started off

166
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:47,109
with that and when we got enough

167
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:48,579
traction and interest from that this

168
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,050
actually happened about two months ago

169
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:52,659
we got a quarter million dollars from

170
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,389
UCLA to start the UCLA cannabis research

171
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,439
initiative which I'm the director of so

172
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,829
that's going to be something going

173
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,629
forward yeah and the idea is to be one

174
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:03,490
of the world's leading research centers

175
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,038
focused on cannabis so we're still in

176
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,780
our infancy right now our website looks

177
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:09,610
horrible it's a splash page don't judge

178
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:12,009
us for it but you know we're getting our

179
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,319
stuff together but my whole hypothesis

180
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,300
or the hypothesis that I want to test

181
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,418
through rigorous research is the idea

182
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,400
that cannabis could be a safe cheap

183
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:23,259
effective treatment for a variety of

184
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,569
ailments and at the end of the day I

185
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:27,969
think this conversation extends far

186
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:30,069
beyond cannabis and that you know

187
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,510
cannabis you could call it instead of

188
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,939
calling it a gateway drug I think it you

189
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:36,519
could call it a gateway herb for how it

190
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:39,009
changes the way that we look at and

191
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:42,339
utilize certain compounds that can be

192
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:43,750
found in food or plants that might not

193
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:45,189
be useful to be commercialized by a

194
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,009
pharmaceutical company because it's

195
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:48,868
unpatentable and

196
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:52,229
you know from from a profit standpoint

197
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:54,389
it's not very viable but cannabis is 100

198
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:56,728
to 1000 times larger of a market in

199
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,408
America than gingko biloba or echinacea

200
00:07:56,728 --> 00:08:00,778
or tumeric so for once

201
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:02,490
there actually is enough money in this

202
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:04,139
pool that we can siphon away a little

203
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,999
bit that we can actually do research

204
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,439
that's never been done I'm not saying

205
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:09,028
that these other herbal products don't

206
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,949
have uses that's just there's never been

207
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:12,718
research money for it now or interest

208
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,490
but for cannabis there is it's a hundred

209
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:16,168
to a thousand times larger than the

210
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,699
market for any other botanical that's my

211
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:20,188
interest in this that's why I think it's

212
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,080
profound and I'm dedicating my career

213
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:24,899
for the foreseeable future for this so

214
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:29,308
that's great yes that's certainly worth

215
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:31,379
giving in my hand this is not I'm just

216
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:34,229
curious are you going to try to apply

217
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,930
for any of the tax revenue that's going

218
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:38,009
to come in from you know Alma yeah

219
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,068
definitely so there's ten million

220
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:42,990
dollars a year to the UC system to study

221
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:45,000
that impacts of legalization now that's

222
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,289
pretty broad you could be studying

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,629
criminal justice you could be crowing

224
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:51,179
studying the economic impacts hopefully

225
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:53,189
a part of that question will also be the

226
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:57,179
health benefit specifically the

227
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,069
therapeutic uses I'm not I imagine from

228
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:01,109
a priority standpoint most of that money

229
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:03,719
is going to go towards criminal justice

230
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,550
youth studying the youth to see if

231
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,870
they're using more economic stuff I

232
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,609
don't think a lot of that ten million

233
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,259
it's gonna go towards a therapeutic use

234
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,089
of cannabis so at the end of the day

235
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,679
we're looking at other ways that we can

236
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:15,300
get money for this type of work

237
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,818
well I'm correct I think it's saying

238
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,469
that UC San Diego was the officially

239
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:20,909
designated school that was going to get

240
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,160
two million dollars a year from the tax

241
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:26,519
revenue comes in from the adult use act

242
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:27,899
and UC Irvine just decided to create a

243
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,269
research program and I think they're

244
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,100
trying to apply for a portion of a

245
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,839
portion of that money so so you see all

246
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,970
these behind you on this so to speak

247
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,589
yeah oh yeah this was they gave us the

248
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,240
money to do this this is an official

249
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:41,940
program I actually moved into my office

250
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,799
a few weeks ago this is an official

251
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,459
program we haven't done any sort of

252
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:49,229
press release press launch yet so you'll

253
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:51,899
be still via that that'll come a few

254
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,060
months down the road I'm really the way

255
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,100
that I approach this is at my heart I'm

256
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,099
an entrepreneur and I don't want to

257
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,420
sleep approach it the way that an

258
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,840
academic or a lifelong researcher might

259
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:02,069
approach

260
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,810
I'm really trying to think how do we

261
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,520
make this sexy how do we get people to

262
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:06,629
care how do we get people to donate to

263
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,240
this research how do we get people to

264
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:11,309
support it so it's kind of a different

265
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,470
philosophy that I'm taking then UC San

266
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:15,959
Diego might or UC Irvine oh that's great

267
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:20,970
and certainly keep us posted because we

268
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,710
are here to help so okay let's start

269
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,769
with Rob Rob you and I've talked a

270
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:28,830
little bit about health and wellness as

271
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:30,419
it relates to medical I personally can

272
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,020
say for myself that cannabis use for me

273
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:35,459
has been almost exclusively for wellness

274
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:36,779
I'd love to talk to you a little bit of

275
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,540
talk to you about that a little bit and

276
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:41,250
and see how you feel that that connects

277
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:44,459
to the medical side of things I actually

278
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,710
had a pseudo little mini argument on one

279
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,170
of the talk shows that I did but while I

280
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,389
was on the campaign about whether or not

281
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:53,819
cannabis is medicine or whether it's

282
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:55,769
wellness and of course for me I go with

283
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,360
the wellness part but of course it's

284
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:59,009
medicine as well and the guy I was

285
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,350
talking to was like no it's only

286
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,720
medicine and I was like well it's it's

287
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,009
medicine to me and it's wellness what do

288
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:12,629
you think what's your take on all of

289
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:15,750
that so our view is that it's all a

290
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:18,779
continuum so these terms medicine

291
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:23,360
wellness adult use recreational use

292
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:28,309
getting high it being a you for ian's

293
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,450
Sacrament you know these are all words

294
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:33,329
so if you look back at the history of

295
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,730
cannabis you know cannabis was first

296
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:39,120
used about 10,000 years ago to create

297
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,970
rope and then about 8,000 years ago it

298
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,789
was developed into textiles and then

299
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,100
about 6,000 years ago it was first

300
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:50,610
turned into paper and about 4,000 years

301
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,100
ago it was first used as a medicine okay

302
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,169
but I mean the just to jumping around a

303
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,810
bit but the word medicine is you might

304
00:11:55,169 --> 00:12:00,509
have tried this on your colleague

305
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:03,149
you know court you know cannabis is a

306
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:05,309
Schedule one narcotic under the

307
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:08,100
controlled substance act and one of the

308
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:09,809
things that defines something's that's a

309
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,050
Schedule one narcotic is that it has no

310
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:16,388
medical value so legally

311
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:19,599
technically in the United States it's

312
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:21,730
not a medicine so again

313
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,800
those words are arbitrary they're just

314
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,499
labels that we put onto things about

315
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:31,808
4000 years ago the Chinese first used

316
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:34,149
cannabis as a medicine and then it moved

317
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:36,610
into Persia and it moved into India and

318
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:40,448
proliferated around the world and for

319
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:43,058
centuries for centuries cannabis was

320
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:45,488
used in virtually every culture across

321
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:48,308
the world as a raw material for

322
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:51,579
industrial use to make rope and textiles

323
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:55,269
and paper and it was used as a medicine

324
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:59,528
and it was used as a euphoria

325
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:02,669
so what is it historically it's been all

326
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:06,009
those things the way you use it

327
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:09,128
engenders a label so when we're talking

328
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:10,449
about medical versus adult use and I'm

329
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,949
gonna try to stay away from the word

330
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:14,558
recreation all I might come out of my

331
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:15,849
mouth a little bit but I think I feel

332
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:17,708
like we've been talking about this a

333
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,048
while and adult use just feels a little

334
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:23,669
bit better to me but either way we're

335
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:26,230
talking about vertical versus adult use

336
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,998
little get your products your products

337
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,899
for example where do you call it where

338
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:34,058
do you put them again personally I would

339
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:36,698
connect our products to the way someone

340
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:38,678
uses them we're you know we're also

341
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:41,289
brand marketers we're experts on

342
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:43,328
consumer behavior so just

343
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:44,588
philosophically as a marketer I don't

344
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:47,469
want to tell someone how to use anything

345
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:49,449
I want to help them use whatever it is

346
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:53,379
they're buying for the best use in their

347
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:56,798
life just generally so somebody who uses

348
00:13:53,379 --> 00:14:00,819
inedible to go see a concert because

349
00:13:56,798 --> 00:14:03,639
it's gonna expand accentuate enhance

350
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:07,058
their experience that's recreational or

351
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:12,039
adult use or they're using it as a you

352
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:15,188
for ian's but somebody who you know

353
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:18,129
unfortunately has you know neurological

354
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:20,738
disease or AIDS or cancer or neuropathy

355
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:23,379
or autoimmune disease or goes to the gym

356
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:26,899
and has sore muscles they're using it

357
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:28,819
for some kind of medical effect wellness

358
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,159
health and wellness is another just term

359
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:33,409
so it's really a gradation as far as I'm

360
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:35,749
concerned if you you know pull a muscle

361
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:38,868
at the gym and you use a cannabis and

362
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:41,439
fuse topical to relieve it you know you

363
00:14:38,869 --> 00:14:44,089
can go to the soup pharmacy and buy

364
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:45,948
ibuprofen for that it's an

365
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:49,009
over-the-counter remedy you know you

366
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:51,049
have nutriceuticals and dietary

367
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,300
supplements what are those you know so

368
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:57,618
these are just terms somebody who is

369
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:59,719
sick who uses it for pain relief or to

370
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:02,360
relieve their nausea or to help them

371
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,839
sleep or to stimulate their appetite if

372
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:09,490
they can't eat it sounds like a medicine

373
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:12,589
to me so we try to educate consumers

374
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:15,110
about the many uses for cannabis helped

375
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:17,420
them make smart choices choose good

376
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,980
products that are you know well

377
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:22,308
manufactured with quality ingredients

378
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:25,129
for the particular need they have we we

379
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:28,100
want to educate consumers and patients

380
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:32,899
and we don't we don't really see it as

381
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:35,629
it's this or that Jeff from your

382
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,818
perspective how do we or should we be

383
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:39,110
looking at medical products and adult

384
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:41,299
use products differently should we

385
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,039
expect something different from medical

386
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:45,068
products than we are said that we should

387
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:48,730
from adult use products going forward

388
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:53,469
yeah it's a it's a really good question

389
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:56,720
and you know looking at other states

390
00:15:53,470 --> 00:16:00,740
where the products are sold alongside

391
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,240
each other in the same stores I wonder

392
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,009
and I'm not I'm not sure about this but

393
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,039
I wonder if often you're basically

394
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:08,449
taking the same products and it's just

395
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,789
all marketing and branding and

396
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:12,649
positioning whether to put a more

397
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:16,370
aesthetically appealing label on it that

398
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:18,289
it might be more medical versus not and

399
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:21,610
then the other layer that I often think

400
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:25,308
about is there's lots of companies who

401
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,899
create formulations that they kind of

402
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:28,458
try to target at different medical

403
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:30,438
conditions and again I wonder how much

404
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,758
of that is just the branding and the

405
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:35,809
packaging and that the actual

406
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:38,180
formulation itself isn't very different

407
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:40,008
the way and this this is where you know

408
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:41,419
I'm not super familiar in this part of

409
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:42,620
the policy but his weight it correct me

410
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:45,259
if I'm wrong but the way I understand in

411
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,419
California is they're likely going to be

412
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:49,039
sold side by side but if you're

413
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:51,349
purchasing medical products you don't

414
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,088
pay you don't pay the 10% Board of

415
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:57,139
Equalization tax but everybody will pay

416
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:58,339
the 15% exactly right and so going back

417
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:00,230
to original question you know I think

418
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,180
there's always going to be people who

419
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,308
will position their products for medical

420
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:07,220
and whether or not it is actually a

421
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:10,068
better product is you know that's gonna

422
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,650
be a completely different black box that

423
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:14,418
we need to answer I guess related to

424
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:19,179
that then is what makes what would make

425
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:22,280
a product more medical than recreational

426
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:24,110
certainly the delivery route is gonna

427
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:27,588
determine a lot of that

428
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:29,689
so obviously combustion fire like not a

429
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,298
good thing there's carcinogens there's

430
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,400
all sorts of stuff you're exposing to

431
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:37,490
you know vaporization traditionally

432
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,580
isn't seen as a medical delivery route

433
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,349
at least in you know Western medicine

434
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:45,408
that could change for cannabis and

435
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:47,798
that's because cannabinoids are poorly

436
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:50,230
absorbed and there's a lot of

437
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:52,700
variability in how they're absorbed

438
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,460
there's enter user variability so

439
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,960
between different people who we assume

440
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,288
should absorb it roughly the same rates

441
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,940
you see differences depending on whether

442
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,859
what you've just eaten before after

443
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,529
that's gonna affect how you absorb it

444
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:09,740
and so I suspect this is why for Marinol

445
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:13,908
you had a lot of people who did not find

446
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:16,730
it had very adverse reactions to it it's

447
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:19,220
because between human subjects between

448
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,569
patients one dose that might work for

449
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,730
somebody if you somebody else on that

450
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:24,710
dose it might be too much or depending

451
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,788
on if they just for instance had a meal

452
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,860
and they took it they're gonna absorb

453
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:30,408
more verses on an empty stomach

454
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:32,109
and now suddenly what dosage used to

455
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:35,450
work for them now suddenly making them

456
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:37,699
you know - it's too much for them so I

457
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,950
suspect that's a part of it and to help

458
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,600
you kind of conceptualize this GW

459
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,509
Pharmaceuticals when they created

460
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:47,418
sativex which is the one to one THC to

461
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:49,158
CBD product there's a reason that they

462
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,590
do an oral mucosal spray there's a

463
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:51,690
reason you

464
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:53,819
Spray it in the back EMF and they didn't

465
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,250
just put it in a pill form that's cuz

466
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:58,319
they quickly realized that if you're in

467
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,319
Doorly ingesting cannabinoids it's

468
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,849
really hard to predict how much is

469
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:04,798
absorbed and how quickly it's absorbed

470
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:07,379
again it varies in between people and it

471
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:10,408
varies on what else is with it so if you

472
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,690
think about edible products how you

473
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:15,360
create the edible product is going to

474
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,419
dramatically affect how quickly absorb

475
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,729
and how much you absorb so if you start

476
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:22,880
thinking about from that standpoint it's

477
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,140
not you can't really just transition

478
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,409
recreational products over to medical

479
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,028
because depending on the complexes that

480
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:31,559
cannabinoids sit in whether it's a brown

481
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:34,429
and versus a lollipop versus the

482
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:37,678
beverage even though it's the same I

483
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:39,210
think even though it's the same you know

484
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,980
even though you're only administering

485
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,200
maybe 10 milligrams of THC if it's in a

486
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,730
beverage versus a cookie versus the

487
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,649
lollipop they're gonna have dramatic

488
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,349
differences and how quickly and how much

489
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:51,028
they absorb so from that standpoint you

490
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:53,099
definitely are going to have to create a

491
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:58,619
dichotomy with how you think about these

492
00:19:53,099 --> 00:20:00,028
products hello oh there we go is that is

493
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:06,199
that something that you are gonna be

494
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:09,028
spending time researching I would I

495
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,909
would like that to be a focus of our

496
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:14,909
research but as many of you know we are

497
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:17,399
precluded from using any cannabis

498
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:20,880
products in our research that doesn't

499
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:22,558
come from the federal government so

500
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,600
theoretically actually you just gave me

501
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,788
a really good idea so one thing that we

502
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:29,129
could do is we could get cannabis from

503
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:31,619
the federal government and then get

504
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,260
approval to prepare it differently in

505
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:36,359
two different formats of beverage versus

506
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:39,000
an edible and then administer that to

507
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:41,308
subjects in our study and that way that

508
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,750
data would actually have more we call it

509
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:44,940
external validity it would have more

510
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,819
real world relevance to what's happening

511
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,710
in the cannabis sector because a lot of

512
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:52,109
the official cannabis research on

513
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:55,528
America it's been done with rolled

514
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:59,609
cigarettes of cannabis of potency that's

515
00:20:55,528 --> 00:21:01,648
maybe five to seven percent potency they

516
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:02,779
haven't been doing controlled studies on

517
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:04,519
dabs or

518
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:06,649
extracts or edibles or anything else

519
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:08,599
really aside from rolled cigarettes and

520
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,880
some studies where they did vaporization

521
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,719
that used like a lily of volcanoes done

522
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,700
at UC San Diego

523
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,850
they used a volcano and they showed that

524
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,289
vaporization was a legitimate way to use

525
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:20,990
the cannabis so that was actually a

526
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:22,250
pretty cool study that was actually you

527
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,200
know I've got that got approved and was

528
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:28,700
done at UC San Diego

529
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,930
with federal well so interestingly the

530
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,000
the so the federal government does not

531
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,799
fund therapeutic research the money that

532
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,599
UC San Diego has been using actually

533
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:37,430
came from California so what's been

534
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,399
funding the research at UC San Diego for

535
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,660
the last 15 years was money from the

536
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,870
state of California that was earmarked

537
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,180
for cannabis research they actually just

538
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:49,969
ran out of that money a year ago and

539
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,410
luckily now they have a pipeline of two

540
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,000
million dollar after prop C form to prop

541
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,440
64 they have a pipeline of 2 million

542
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,029
dollars a year to keep doing what

543
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,400
they're doing so they're studying things

544
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:01,430
like driving impairment what's how do

545
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,660
you measure driving impairment and you

546
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,039
know obviously you don't want people on

547
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,600
the road that are stoned out of their

548
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,389
minds but you also don't want to give

549
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:10,579
people DUIs who are using it for

550
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,200
legitimate medical use and just they

551
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,480
have a high tolerance so that's actually

552
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,720
a very complicated question and it looks

553
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,400
like the answer is some sort of an a

554
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,380
driving simulator an app that you give

555
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,880
somebody on the roadside because blood

556
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,390
levels saliva levels they don't

557
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,710
correlate with actual impairment very

558
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,360
interesting very interesting

559
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,759
um that's probably something we could

560
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,279
talk about all day but Rob I want to

561
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,690
talk to you a little bit about

562
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,369
anti-anxiety meds we've talked a little

563
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,860
bit about this and something that you

564
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:41,239
feel is pretty close to your heart

565
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:43,879
there's something some studies that

566
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,160
cannabis is maybe starting to be able to

567
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,570
replace some of the anti-anxiety meds

568
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,350
can you tell us a little bit more about

569
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:55,669
that and what your thoughts are on it

570
00:22:50,349 --> 00:23:00,500
sure everybody's anxious you know it's a

571
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:03,230
human condition you know we could get

572
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:07,039
you know Jeff can do studies you know

573
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:11,809
double-blind placebo-controlled studies

574
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:14,720
but most people if they smoke a joint

575
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:17,440
they just empirically know it alleviates

576
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,440
anxiety

577
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:26,470
so talking about taking away til bottles

578
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:28,240
that are yeah so we we have where the

579
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,680
Lord Jones brand but we operate a

580
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,079
collective called Hollywood Hills

581
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:36,759
wellness we have hundreds and hundreds

582
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:41,829
of members and we have dozens and dozens

583
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:43,869
and if not more members who have the

584
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:48,299
very similar experience they suffer

585
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:51,489
chronic anxiety they've taken every SSRI

586
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:54,730
imaginable they have adverse side

587
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:58,120
effects and something has led them to

588
00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:00,000
cannabis a friend relative just trial

589
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:04,119
and error and these are not people who

590
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,720
use a lot of cannabis recreationally or

591
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:09,429
for adult use or to get high they're

592
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,950
actually most of them quite reluctant

593
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,630
and sheepish about trying cannabis and

594
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:18,730
they come to us they join the collective

595
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:25,120
and we give them different varieties of

596
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:30,069
cannabinoids and universally they report

597
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:32,169
that they've been transformed reborn I'm

598
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:33,909
my new self all of those things you kind

599
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:37,390
of read about when prozac was first

600
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:39,880
introduced that and more

601
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,130
dozens of testimonials of people who

602
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,290
said I've thrown my pills away and I use

603
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,360
cannabis and I feel better there are

604
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:51,369
fewer side effects and it's more natural

605
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:52,990
and that's been our experience and you

606
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:54,909
know we didn't really know where we were

607
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,130
going when we decided to enter the

608
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:00,490
cannabis industry it was formal

609
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:02,410
collective we we had a pretty pedestrian

610
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,940
view of we're gonna we're gonna help

611
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,769
people get high and we're gonna make

612
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,529
better products and we're gonna label

613
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:12,039
them that was kind of where we started

614
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:14,889
we had no idea about anxiety as an issue

615
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:16,899
we had no idea about pain relief as an

616
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,759
issue we you know we can tell you all

617
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,040
kinds of stories that we learn from our

618
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:23,829
patients every week you know we with

619
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,859
this woman was given one of our topicals

620
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:28,539
as a gag gift by one of her friends

621
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,409
there was a joke at a dinner party and

622
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:31,779
gave it to her and

623
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:34,660
every night before she would go to bed

624
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:37,299
she'd used some hand cream to make her

625
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:40,120
skin soft so she put our bottle on her

626
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:42,849
bedside table and started to use our

627
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:45,339
lotion instead of whatever she was using

628
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:48,250
and she noticed after two weeks her

629
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:50,709
nails her cuticles stopped chipping and

630
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:55,000
they were stronger I don't even know if

631
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:56,829
she realized she had weak nails and she

632
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,569
used up the bottle and then two weeks

633
00:25:56,829 --> 00:26:01,449
after later her nail started to chip

634
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:02,409
again and she called us and we this was

635
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,380
something I mean I don't know if you've

636
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:08,590
studied this Jeff but we didn't we had

637
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,950
no idea like its cuticle health it

638
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:13,149
strengthens nails and we started to tell

639
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:17,080
people about it and it would that

640
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:21,180
happens time and again we have friends

641
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:24,089
who are stylist to the celebrities and

642
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:27,940
one of the women who works in our office

643
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:29,470
hates wearing high heels and went to a

644
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,940
wedding and she took our lotion and

645
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,140
rubbed it on her heels before she went

646
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,029
to the wedding but she came back and she

647
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,770
said look I put this on my feet before I

648
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:37,660
went to the wedding and I didn't have

649
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:39,670
any pain in my high heels I'm crippled

650
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:43,150
when I come home from a wedding and so

651
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:45,070
we we gave it we started to give it to

652
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:51,220
the stylist and we were written up in

653
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:53,889
billboard and Hollywood Reporter and and

654
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,329
our lotion was used at the Golden Globes

655
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,880
and the Oscars for all the celebrities

656
00:26:55,329 --> 00:27:01,990
feet so we're learning you know the

657
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,450
point is people like Jeff you know we

658
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:07,329
need to understand the true potential of

659
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:10,000
cannabis as a medicine because we don't

660
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:12,509
know what it does we'd be expecting a

661
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,839
Lord Jones football any day now

662
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:19,990
he'll bomb for sure so so so on that

663
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:21,579
note I think you know there's there's a

664
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:24,609
lot of amazing anecdotal evidence out

665
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:27,159
there and that actually helped

666
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:31,269
scientists know what to focus in on so

667
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:34,029
if not for the parents who had started

668
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:35,019
using CBD for the epileptic children you

669
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:37,149
know the researchers would have never

670
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:40,150
gotten on board and actually the people

671
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:42,070
of GW Pharmaceuticals CBD for epilepsy

672
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,400
was not in their product pipeline as of

673
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:45,109
like 2011

674
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,269
and it was really they started getting

675
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:50,329
some emails from parents we're like you

676
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:52,430
guys developed this THC CBD drug called

677
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:53,599
Sativex for multiple sclerosis why

678
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,100
aren't you doing CBD for epilepsy

679
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,109
haven't you seen the videos like what

680
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:59,179
videos and so this is a pharma company

681
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:00,949
who was informed by the anecdotal

682
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,930
evidence of patients so I think the

683
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,460
anecdotal evidence is valuable I think

684
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,400
there needs to be a way like a

685
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,250
centralized way that we can collect all

686
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,130
of this anecdotal evidence and really be

687
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,779
able to if if this if the number of

688
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,150
participants in this study is large

689
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:19,700
enough that we can start teasing apart

690
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:21,259
the signal from the noise so you know it

691
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,789
looks like a sense Ichi was partnered

692
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:24,529
with Stanford they were able to

693
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:26,299
distribute a survey to about a thousand

694
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:29,240
cannabis patients to gather their

695
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:32,329
responses my I think how do we get a

696
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,039
hundred thousand respondents to fill out

697
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:36,470
a survey and help us understand what

698
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:38,269
their what it's useful for so then we

699
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:41,179
can take what limited resources we have

700
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:43,460
and hone in on those use cases okay now

701
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:45,800
there is a caveat to all of this and the

702
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,308
caveat is that there is such a thing as

703
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:50,899
the placebo effect it's a real thing and

704
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:52,549
this is so you guys understand this for

705
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,290
cannabis the placebo effect is actually

706
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:56,450
higher than it would be for something

707
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:58,970
else and that's because going into it

708
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:00,620
cannabis already has this reputation so

709
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,819
going in expectations are already more

710
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:03,799
heightened than if I just gave you

711
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:05,509
something I said it's a Chinese herb try

712
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:06,859
it but because I tell you it's cannabis

713
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:07,759
you ready have this preconceived notion

714
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:10,219
that's gonna make the placebo effect

715
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,960
stronger the other thing is when you

716
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,429
take cannabis you actually feel

717
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,049
different because it's psycho at well at

718
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:16,970
least for THC its psychoactive and you

719
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:19,339
feel different that's gonna enhance the

720
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,589
placebo effect more than if I gave you a

721
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:22,759
sugar pill told you was gonna help you

722
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:24,709
but you didn't feel very different

723
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:26,660
afterwards but no I think I'm still my

724
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,039
sleep still pretty bad or my pain still

725
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,870
Birdie bad but with cannabis because you

726
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:31,849
feel the psycho activity that's gonna

727
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:33,769
hence the placebo effect even more so

728
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:35,000
that's justice K that we should take

729
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:36,679
everything with the grain of salt but I

730
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,329
think the anecdotal data is very

731
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,090
valuable and then on the on the topic of

732
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:42,919
being a substitute for pharmaceutical

733
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:45,470
drugs we see this in the literature so

734
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,690
there was a study came out recently that

735
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,630
showed about a two hundred million

736
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,759
dollar reduction in annual Medicare

737
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,200
spending because baby boomers are

738
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:57,490
starting to use cannabis and they'd

739
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,950
attributed this directly to cannabis

740
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,720
and then the other question then at

741
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,750
least for the issue of anxiety which you

742
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,400
guys in benzos you know we do also hear

743
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:09,490
anecdotally that some people smoke

744
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,550
cannabis and they have increased anxiety

745
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,089
and paranoia and I suspect that

746
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:16,000
obviously has something to do with

747
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:17,980
dosage right so maybe it'll load for

748
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,140
instance a low dosage THC is

749
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,299
anti-anxiety properties at a high dosage

750
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,860
it is pro anxiety properties and this

751
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:26,980
leads me to my next point which is that

752
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:28,569
more is not necessarily better and this

753
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,940
is true for a lot of things that's

754
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:32,379
especially true for cannabis and to give

755
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,840
you an example so CBD is an

756
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,970
anti-inflammatory but there are my

757
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:38,319
studies that show if you give if you

758
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,690
give a little bit of C if you give too

759
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,289
little CBD it's not going to have good

760
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:45,940
anti-inflammatory properties if you give

761
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:47,259
immediate moderate dose it's gonna have

762
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,330
anti-inflammatory properties if you give

763
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:51,970
too much CBD the anti-inflammatory

764
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:54,428
properties go away so there's a sweet

765
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:56,440
spot and so how do we find that sweet

766
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:58,809
spot that's part of what hopefully our

767
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,490
research can show as well but so more is

768
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:03,099
not necessarily better and that's that's

769
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,690
you know something that's very you know

770
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:06,849
counterintuitive to the American Way of

771
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,929
doing things but for cannabinoids it's

772
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:10,990
also very true and more is not

773
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:13,120
necessarily better that's actually very

774
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,980
interesting right because especially for

775
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,959
people who build up tolerance you just

776
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,849
you might want to continue to take more

777
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,500
and more and more but actually it's not

778
00:31:18,849 --> 00:31:21,909
gonna really do anything for you well

779
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,829
and also you know your body's make

780
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:27,009
endocannabinoids but when you flood your

781
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:30,339
body with external cannabinoids your

782
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:31,960
body is going to decrease the amount of

783
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:34,569
endogenous cannabinoids that it's making

784
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,000
right it has a feedback system it knows

785
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:39,639
it basically says here's the level of

786
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,679
cannabinoids I want to be at and when

787
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,030
I'm here I bring it back up but if you

788
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,250
flood the body with external

789
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:47,259
cannabinoids like heavy daily

790
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,640
cannabinoids your body's gonna say oh

791
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:50,740
there's plenty of cannabinoids out there

792
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,650
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna make as much

793
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,970
as my own and it's also going to

794
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,170
decrease the amount of cannabinoid

795
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,640
receptors out there because it's saying

796
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:59,529
these cannabinoid receptors are being

797
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,790
over stimulated I'm actually going to

798
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:02,619
decrease the amount of receptors out

799
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:04,210
there and now you're talking about a

800
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:05,558
very Kondo cannabinoid system is very

801
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,870
complex now you start thinking about

802
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:09,129
what what are all the unintended side

803
00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:10,178
effects and consequences so another

804
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,659
reason why more

805
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:15,278
is not necessarily better it's really

806
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:17,049
interesting right yeah I would say

807
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,378
that's give us a round of applause for

808
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:22,808
that let's talk about consistency thank

809
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:25,269
you let's talk about consistency and and

810
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:27,638
from both of your perspectives do we

811
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:29,679
need to be looking at consistency on the

812
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:32,408
medical side anything different then

813
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,749
we're looking at consistency with adult

814
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:35,649
use product or should you know cuz we

815
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:38,319
know that there's going to be pretty

816
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:41,349
stringent testing you know criteria and

817
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:43,089
regulations how do we look forward into

818
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:44,558
the consistency issue because I know

819
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:46,329
that for years that's been one of the

820
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,769
biggest problems right because it's

821
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:49,960
still a plant the end of the day it's

822
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:52,388
still a plant so it can't be exactly the

823
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,829
same every time right that's the

824
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:57,189
difference between a pharmaceutical and

825
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:58,269
a nutraceutical in this case so what do

826
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,519
you either review we don't you want to

827
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:04,778
go first maybe Jeff or about consistency

828
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:06,730
yeah sure so you know at first glance

829
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:09,240
like obviously yes medical needs to be

830
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,470
more consistent you have someone who is

831
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,878
reliant on this for their pain relief

832
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,700
for their sleep and minor and

833
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:17,048
fluctuations in their products suddenly

834
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,720
they're you know they went and bought

835
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:21,278
this item a few weeks later they went

836
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,470
back but the same item from the same

837
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,269
manufacturer and now suddenly they have

838
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,129
to take more or it's not benefitting

839
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,419
their sleep as much and it's because

840
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:30,908
you're dealing with the plant the plant

841
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:32,799
is messy even the same clone the same

842
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:33,970
genetics right slightly different

843
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:37,538
environmental conditions are gonna

844
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:39,669
change what's going on with it even if

845
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:42,368
you standardize to just THC right

846
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:44,919
there's like hundreds of other compounds

847
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:46,778
in there and the other point that I want

848
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:48,759
to make is that even though these other

849
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:52,690
compounds might not be particularly

850
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:54,788
abundant these cannabinoids are distinct

851
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,980
molecules so you might need ten

852
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:59,138
milligrams of THC to have a certain

853
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,118
physiologic effect but for this other

854
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:04,240
random cannabinoid X maybe only need

855
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:05,918
point one milligrams for it to exert its

856
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,349
anti-inflammatory properties or its

857
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,000
anti-pain properties so just because

858
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:11,829
these other constituents in cannabis are

859
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,460
present in very minor quantities does

860
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:17,169
not mean that they're insignificant so

861
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,639
yeah even if you standardize to THC or

862
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:19,929
standardized as CBD there's still

863
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,000
there's all these terpenes there's all

864
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:24,010
these other cannabinoids what do they do

865
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,590
then it gets even more complicated

866
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,270
Clayton when you start thinking of them

867
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,860
having interactions with one another and

868
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:31,509
the way that they can have interactions

869
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,820
within with one another is is a term

870
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,899
called allosteric regulation which is

871
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,230
where let's say I have a cannabinoid

872
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:40,690
receptor here you know I might have this

873
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,960
other cannabinoid that might not

874
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:45,970
directly bind to it but it's gonna

875
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,500
affect how this receptor binds to THC or

876
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:49,178
it'll affect how this receptor binds to

877
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,889
CBD so then you start looking at all the

878
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:53,500
permutations of all these combinations

879
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:55,059
it gets mind boggling which is why it's

880
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,179
so hard to develop pharmaceutical drugs

881
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:59,289
out of botanicals so you know at the end

882
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:02,619
of the day I would say that yes we need

883
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:04,119
stricter standards for medical I'm not

884
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:05,739
sure how to get there though you know

885
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:08,319
without being a multi-billion dollar

886
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:10,659
pharmaceutical company that like GW

887
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,210
Pharmaceuticals they make their drugs

888
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:16,179
out of the plant they grow the plant in

889
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:19,059
the UK but they grow it under incredibly

890
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:21,159
sterile incredibly rigorous conditions

891
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:23,650
and that's how they can get the plant to

892
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:25,210
be 99.9 percent consistent each time

893
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,309
then when they throw it into their

894
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:29,139
extractor with the same settings you can

895
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:31,480
get something that is pretty close to

896
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:33,579
consistent the other area that you guys

897
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,710
might want to look towards the future in

898
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:38,110
in understanding how this might shape

899
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,789
out in America is look at Canada so when

900
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,110
Canada first legalized medical they

901
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:43,630
didn't let you just start willy-nilly

902
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:45,370
growing these people had to put in tens

903
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,920
of millions of dollars into

904
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:50,349
state-of-the-art sterile rigorously

905
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,000
controlled growing environments to be

906
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:54,699
able to produce the plants the same

907
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,380
every single batch how is that going to

908
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:57,849
look if the federal government because

909
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,950
we think it's gonna be stepwise right

910
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:01,360
they'll legalize medical federally than

911
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:04,359
recreational if the feds legalized

912
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:06,849
medical are they gonna make you put in

913
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,130
that same infrastructure the same 30

914
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:11,349
million dollars to get a grow facility

915
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,730
up so for you guys to think long term as

916
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:14,469
to how this is going to shape up maybe

917
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:17,460
look towards Canada that might be a

918
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:20,889
model that we adopt here in the US you

919
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,720
know part of part of this whole topic of

920
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:26,289
medical --too and separating it out from

921
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:27,339
adult uses in the packaging and that's

922
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:29,949
something that you're really familiar

923
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,650
with and I'm kind of curious to see what

924
00:36:29,949 --> 00:36:34,649
you think first of all the question one

925
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,840
question that's been brought up which is

926
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:40,480
are you listing all your ingredients

927
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,620
in your not just your cannabinoids right

928
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,849
how are people doing that cuz we're

929
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:44,079
saying oh this is this is gonna be great

930
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:44,889
for you it's healthy but then you start

931
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,920
looking at the rest of the ingredients

932
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:49,539
and it's really crap right so the one

933
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,030
question would be about packaging and

934
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:54,309
and really being very transparent with

935
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:58,480
your packaging and the other part would

936
00:36:54,309 --> 00:37:00,299
be is are we going to continue to

937
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,429
probably have a lot of white label

938
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,769
product that people just buy and then

939
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:07,960
repackage and slap a brand on it and put

940
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:11,530
it out in the store how were we how can

941
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,809
we distinguish between all that those

942
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:15,280
are really good and complicated

943
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:19,239
questions and I think they're even

944
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:23,140
broader which is you know how is the

945
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:27,269
marijuana industry going to evolve in

946
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:33,309
the u.s. its larger than just labeling

947
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:36,940
packaging medical versus adult use you

948
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:40,509
know I I spend a bunch of time thinking

949
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:48,460
about the future of of cannabis as a

950
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:50,460
product in the US you know will it be

951
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,139
taken over by pharmaceutical companies

952
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,900
the pharmaceutical Lobby is the most

953
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:59,170
powerful lobby except possibly the

954
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,880
petroleum Lobby in the world you know if

955
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,260
it's determined to be a medicine all

956
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,450
again I think all these things are

957
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,850
totally arbitrary if it's determined to

958
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:10,179
be a medicine why shouldn't the

959
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:12,279
pharmaceutical companies take it over if

960
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:15,219
is it a dietary supplement is it a

961
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,260
nutraceutical is it like alcohol is it a

962
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:19,929
is it a vice that should be controlled

963
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:22,930
by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and

964
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:24,759
Firearms and cannabis you know what is

965
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:27,279
it is it a consumer product should it be

966
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,080
you know will will Procter and Gamble

967
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,550
and General Mills take over the can I

968
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:35,619
mean these are big questions you know

969
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:37,360
I'm sorry I didn't really answer your

970
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:38,889
question but I think the questions you

971
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,840
brought up are really complicated you

972
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:44,199
know yes I believe everything should be

973
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,730
labeled should things be you know we

974
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,009
just passed a regulation in California

975
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,929
saying that you can't spray THC on to

976
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,609
you know there are a bunch of companies

977
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:55,328
that just go and they buy

978
00:38:51,608 --> 00:38:58,119
bulk crappy candy made with corn syrup

979
00:38:55,329 --> 00:39:02,619
and artificial flavor and colors and

980
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:05,170
then they spray it and I was I was you

981
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:07,298
know I our company weighed in in

982
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,729
Sacramento and and but that was not a

983
00:39:07,298 --> 00:39:14,708
good way to manufacture cannabis

984
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:17,228
products but you know white labeling

985
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:21,578
yeah I mean you know you have one

986
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:23,828
company that makes edibles and then six

987
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:26,739
other companies slap a label on it how

988
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:28,499
do we feel about that I I don't have the

989
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:31,599
answers to that you know we're trying to

990
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:33,389
control our means of production create

991
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,219
something that's super high quality

992
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:39,278
disclose the ingredients create great

993
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:41,108
relationships with our customers that's

994
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:44,619
we're kind of old-fashioned that way in

995
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:46,778
our approach but you're bringing up a

996
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:48,999
lot of questions about you know what is

997
00:39:46,778 --> 00:39:52,119
cannabis and how should it be regulated

998
00:39:48,998 --> 00:39:54,518
and in Canada they do treat it like a

999
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:56,440
medicine and and the manufacturing is

1000
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:58,208
pharmaceutical grade and when you go

1001
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,679
into a grow house it looks more like a

1002
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:04,239
biotech lab than a cultivation Center

1003
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:07,509
there's lots of benefits to that I think

1004
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:09,068
as far as safety goes there's not a lot

1005
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:11,199
of consumer choice up there

1006
00:40:09,068 --> 00:40:16,150
they don't have edibles and topicals yet

1007
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:18,039
they only have flour so I don't I don't

1008
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,869
know the answers to all these questions

1009
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:22,299
but they're really important questions

1010
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:25,298
we just did chime in for a sec you know

1011
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:27,068
in terms of the labeling and and

1012
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,088
ingredients and whatnot that's more

1013
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:30,458
something that will be handled at the

1014
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:32,018
regulatory level so it's almost out of

1015
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:33,909
our hands as to how that'll be handled

1016
00:40:32,018 --> 00:40:35,649
it'll likely be mandated they've to list

1017
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:37,719
all ingredients the white labeling

1018
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:41,199
aspect it happened so much in just

1019
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:43,690
everyday life that it's bound to happen

1020
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,130
I'm sure everyday you go to the grocery

1021
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,599
store you're you might move you in on

1022
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,068
the same day you might buy two different

1023
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:49,930
things that literally are just the same

1024
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:51,278
cereal that got white labeled like

1025
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:53,078
everything you buy a Trader Joe's is

1026
00:40:51,278 --> 00:40:54,400
white labeled yeah everything at Trader

1027
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:55,869
Joe's is white labeled they go to

1028
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,759
companies ago I like this and I put

1029
00:40:55,869 --> 00:41:00,039
their label on it so that's you can

1030
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:01,989
expect it to happen in cannabis on the

1031
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:04,460
issue of again looking towards the

1032
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:06,108
future maybe there's

1033
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,800
few things that you might want to use as

1034
00:41:06,108 --> 00:41:10,549
food for thought so there are certain

1035
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,470
naturally occurring things that

1036
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,480
currently are sold as nutraceuticals

1037
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:16,759
that also have a pharmaceutical version

1038
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,338
so for instance you can go buy fish oil

1039
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:23,140
as a nutraceutical or food supplement

1040
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:26,029
you can also get prescription strength

1041
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:27,920
like omega fatty acids that are

1042
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:31,310
synthetically created that are much more

1043
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,720
expensive and are arguably more pure but

1044
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:34,159
they're out there's some people that are

1045
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:35,719
was going to buy the fish oil and

1046
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,029
there's some people that want to go

1047
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:40,189
after the whatever is the pure version

1048
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,869
in terms of cost it might be more

1049
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:44,210
expensive to make something that's like

1050
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:46,070
that medical grade but if insurance

1051
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:49,250
reimburses for it that's also gonna

1052
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:51,980
change behavior right you might believe

1053
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:54,500
in that you might desire and believe in

1054
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,909
the natural form but hey if your

1055
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,139
insurance is suddenly paying for one and

1056
00:41:55,909 --> 00:41:58,399
not the other like okay maybe I'll let

1057
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:01,579
my doctor prescribe and I'll pick it up

1058
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,190
at the pharmacy and to be to be clear

1059
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:06,289
the pharmaceutical industry in the

1060
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,970
United States is no different than the

1061
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:09,949
consumer packaged goods industry when it

1062
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:12,739
comes to consumer marketing if you watch

1063
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:15,618
you know MSNBC at night it's all

1064
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:18,858
wall-to-wall ads that was something that

1065
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:20,480
was illegal a generation ago and now you

1066
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:22,909
know generation ago you would go to your

1067
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,960
doctor and the dot year you'd consult

1068
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:26,299
with your doctor and your doctor would

1069
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,309
say you need this medicine and you'd say

1070
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,930
what does it do and they'd say it's

1071
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:32,539
gonna help you with this and they

1072
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:34,489
prescribe it now you you watch

1073
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:38,179
television and you go to your doctor say

1074
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:41,299
oh shit I need viagra you know or I need

1075
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:45,618
you know a vilify or whatever you know

1076
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:47,420
you know so there's a lot of

1077
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:50,539
merchandising and marketing in the

1078
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:53,420
pharmaceutical world to which just again

1079
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:55,219
just makes it more complex I had brought

1080
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:57,139
up a question to both of you earlier

1081
00:42:55,219 --> 00:42:59,809
before we got here

1082
00:42:57,139 --> 00:43:03,108
being the were in West Hollywood who was

1083
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:06,759
on the forefront in the 80s of the

1084
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:10,159
hiv/aids syndromes shall we say and

1085
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,839
medical marijuana was a really big help

1086
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,519
do either of you have any thoughts on

1087
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:17,029
that or any just contribution to that

1088
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:18,440
whole that whole story and how you know

1089
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,750
because that's still a treatment

1090
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,880
right it's medical cannabis is still a

1091
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:25,219
treatment for HIV do you see any

1092
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,108
development happening in that area do

1093
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:29,858
you see any kind of forward movement or

1094
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:29,858
are we still stuck

1095
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:42,260
so hiv/aids and and cancer too in our

1096
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:45,679
experience our patients use it not so

1097
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,780
much to treat HIV AIDS and cancer but to

1098
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,509
mitigate the side effects of the

1099
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:54,410
treatments of HIV and cancer so you know

1100
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,910
both cancer and AIDS medication the

1101
00:43:54,409 --> 00:43:58,460
antiviral drugs they do a bunch of

1102
00:43:55,909 --> 00:44:02,480
things they cause people to become sick

1103
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:04,309
lose their appetite become nauseous some

1104
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,068
people have problems sleeping and

1105
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:10,160
obviously they're create great pain and

1106
00:44:07,068 --> 00:44:12,829
discomfort so cannabis can help

1107
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:16,519
alleviate most of those symptoms that's

1108
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:18,910
why most people that come to us are

1109
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:22,699
using it now there's a whole lot of

1110
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:24,949
noise out there about cancer cannabis

1111
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:27,409
kills cancer and I did read something

1112
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:29,659
recently about that that some of the

1113
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:33,199
cannabinoids may actually attack the

1114
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:35,298
AIDS virus in some way where you know

1115
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:37,669
I'm never gonna tell somebody who has

1116
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:40,338
cancer cannabis is gonna cure cancer

1117
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:43,190
there's no medical proof for that but I

1118
00:44:40,338 --> 00:44:44,480
think there is enough you know if where

1119
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:47,778
there's smoke there's fire it's

1120
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,559
certainly I'll throw this over to Jeff I

1121
00:44:47,778 --> 00:44:54,469
need to really scientifically

1122
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:57,410
investigate that stuff yes on the topic

1123
00:44:54,469 --> 00:45:00,649
of cannabis and HIV or AIDS

1124
00:44:57,409 --> 00:45:03,199
you know Marinol synthetic THC is FDA

1125
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,880
approved for anorexia which is weight

1126
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,618
loss but specifically anorexia

1127
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,809
associated with AIDS right so that's

1128
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:10,789
kind of the first thing that happened in

1129
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:13,579
the late 80s or the 90s they believe

1130
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:15,200
there have also been studies actually

1131
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:17,298
done also again at UC San Diego they've

1132
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:21,469
done a great job looking specifically at

1133
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:23,538
cannabis for neuropathic pain nerve pain

1134
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:26,028
from patients with AIDS and it looks

1135
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:28,220
positive for that as well so you know

1136
00:45:26,028 --> 00:45:29,420
all these things coalescing now then

1137
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:32,149
there's the other question is that

1138
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:35,240
cannabinoids are anti-inflammatories

1139
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:36,710
right which is great if you have an

1140
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:38,659
maybe if you have an autoimmune

1141
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:41,840
condition theoretically it might be able

1142
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:44,119
to help that but anti-inflammatories

1143
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,700
also suppress your immune system and so

1144
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,929
in that sense we actually had they did a

1145
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:50,929
study on this I think at UC San

1146
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:54,049
Francisco because the concern was if you

1147
00:45:50,929 --> 00:45:55,579
have AIDS and you're using cannabis

1148
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,050
maybe to gain weight or to help with

1149
00:45:55,579 --> 00:45:58,610
your nausea but the cannabis is

1150
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:00,830
suppressing your immune system even more

1151
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:02,599
so right the AIDS virus is suppressing

1152
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:04,460
your immune system is killing all your

1153
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:05,960
white blood cells and then the cannabis

1154
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,000
being an anti-inflammatory does it

1155
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,470
additionally immunosuppressed you and

1156
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,719
make you susceptible to all these

1157
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:13,069
infections are you in aids you don't die

1158
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:15,230
from the AIDS virus you die from

1159
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:17,710
infections and it looked like the study

1160
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:20,269
that did that show that it did not

1161
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:22,639
measurably increase your risk for

1162
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:23,989
infections so even though cannabis was

1163
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,569
an anti-inflammatory people who have

1164
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:29,179
AIDS it wasn't further suppressing their

1165
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:32,510
immune systems which is a good thing so

1166
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:34,909
and you added a last point about oh like

1167
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:36,830
cancer yeah yeah I mean cannabinoids

1168
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:38,299
have anti-tumor properties they've only

1169
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:40,219
been done in animal studies but they've

1170
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:45,670
been done across a wide variety of

1171
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:50,480
cancer cell types brain lung colon skin

1172
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:52,760
and many others and the mechanisms are

1173
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,190
multifactorial right so we know that

1174
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,060
they have direct

1175
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:58,340
cancer killing properties through a

1176
00:46:56,059 --> 00:47:01,489
process called apoptosis so when your

1177
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:03,410
cells become at least let me rephrase in

1178
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:06,079
animal studies when cells become

1179
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:08,319
cancerous they actually increase the

1180
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:12,019
expression of cannabinoid receptors

1181
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,130
generally and when cannabinoids activate

1182
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:14,630
these cannabinoid receptors actually

1183
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:17,119
triggers the cancer cell to kill itself

1184
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:19,309
so can't still commit suicide it's a

1185
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:23,150
process called apoptosis so cannabinoids

1186
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:26,029
do that cannabinoids also prevent can

1187
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:28,280
inhibit the cancer cells from getting

1188
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,480
food so cancer cells need to nourish

1189
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,000
themselves especially if they're growing

1190
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,590
fast so they send out chemicals that

1191
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,269
tell your blood vessels to come to the

1192
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:36,769
cancer cell right because the cancer

1193
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:39,289
cell is hungry it needs to feed and

1194
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:40,849
cannabinoids seem to also cut off that

1195
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,619
process it prevents blood cells from

1196
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:44,299
getting to the cancer cells and lastly

1197
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:45,449
cancer cells need to spread and it

1198
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,430
appears that cannabinoids

1199
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:48,899
are also able to inhibit the spreading

1200
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:49,799
of the cancer cells this process called

1201
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,619
metastasis

1202
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,480
okay so through all these mechanisms

1203
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:56,640
cannabinoids are able to do that good

1204
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,349
news is so bad news it's a limpid any

1205
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,088
animal studies good news they just did

1206
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:02,910
the first human study the results came

1207
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:05,670
out it was a combination of THC and CBD

1208
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:07,889
for glioblastoma multiforme like the

1209
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:11,039
most dangerous deadly form of brain

1210
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:13,170
cancer and this was a placebo randomized

1211
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:16,289
control trial and the cannabinoids had a

1212
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:20,730
significant survival benefit so it was

1213
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:23,099
yeah yeah so the people that got the

1214
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:25,440
cannabinoids 83 percent of them had

1215
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:26,099
survival at one year the group that

1216
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,079
didn't get it

1217
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:30,809
53 percent were alive at one year so

1218
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,670
significant very preliminary study very

1219
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:34,920
small study only about 10 people in each

1220
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:36,510
treatment arm the other caveat I want to

1221
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,858
add missus and then we'll wrap this up

1222
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:44,460
not all cancer cells Express cannabinoid

1223
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:45,989
receptors and so if your cancer cells

1224
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,130
aren't expressing cannabinoid receptors

1225
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:49,828
and you're hitting them cannabinoids

1226
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:51,809
you're not really gonna do much what you

1227
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:54,269
might do is you might suppress their

1228
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:55,799
immune system and our immune system also

1229
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:57,780
helps keep cancers in check

1230
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,420
so now you can see where this gets very

1231
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,890
complicated very fast and this is

1232
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,829
another instance where more is not

1233
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:07,949
necessarily better so just a caveat to

1234
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:09,839
keep in mind going forward so I'm gonna

1235
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:11,879
wrap this part up and then we're gonna

1236
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:13,588
take some questions but I just want to

1237
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,990
ask a simple question to both of you

1238
00:49:13,588 --> 00:49:17,159
cuz I bet that everybody in this room if

1239
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:18,929
you're in the cannabis industry you've

1240
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:21,568
gotten this question from someone you

1241
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:23,879
know which is I'm sick fill in the blank

1242
00:49:21,568 --> 00:49:26,219
or my husband wife daughter friends etc

1243
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,240
is sick with something fill in the blank

1244
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:29,009
what do I do

1245
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:30,750
so we're talking about cancer we're

1246
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:32,880
talking about fibromyalgia we're talking

1247
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:35,730
about you know epilepsy and the chronic

1248
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,119
pains where do I go what do i do do I

1249
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:41,400
just go get a paper Iser and call it a

1250
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,260
day do I you know what is it what do you

1251
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,690
as individuals and as people in the

1252
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,040
industry recommend and say to people

1253
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,858
that come up to you because that I know

1254
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:52,710
it happens to me all the time

1255
00:49:48,858 --> 00:49:54,029
what do you respond to that Rob you bet

1256
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:56,010
you could ask that a lot you're a

1257
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,540
product guy so you know that's a tricky

1258
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:03,210
thing because I'm not

1259
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:06,329
dr. but we also we provide access to

1260
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,780
cannabis so it's a weird role we call

1261
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:12,269
ourselves

1262
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:15,930
lay practitioners the first thing we

1263
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:18,480
wanted you know we'll rely on what has

1264
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:20,809
helped patients that we've worked with

1265
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,240
but the big question we want to know is

1266
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:26,250
is this something that's going to be

1267
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:28,979
treated with a topical or an ingestible

1268
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:32,849
is this something that's systemic or is

1269
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:35,429
it something that's local and sometimes

1270
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:38,519
will will offer a combination of the two

1271
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:40,289
so like migraines and menstrual pain are

1272
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:42,000
two things too where we might use a

1273
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:47,460
combination of an adjustable and a

1274
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,429
topical but you know there's a lot of

1275
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:53,820
trial and error and what we do and we

1276
00:50:50,429 --> 00:50:57,269
are basing what we do on anecdotal

1277
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:59,460
evidence as practitioners we're not

1278
00:50:57,269 --> 00:51:02,130
doctors and then also if there's any

1279
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,349
question at all if we don't feel real

1280
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:06,030
comfortable okay we have lots of

1281
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:07,889
patients who use it this way we'll tell

1282
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:09,420
them to go see a doctor I mean we're not

1283
00:51:07,889 --> 00:51:16,019
going to go out on a limb and offer

1284
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:17,670
medical advice yeah it's I don't know if

1285
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:20,190
I can really comment very much on this I

1286
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:21,809
get asked all the time and at the end of

1287
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:24,510
the day I don't really even know what to

1288
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:26,519
tell them because there's so many

1289
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:28,650
questions it's will it work for that

1290
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:31,079
condition what dosage do you take what

1291
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:33,300
delivery format then they like started

1292
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:34,500
asking about what brand do I use like

1293
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,150
how do I know what's how do I even know

1294
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,849
what's in this brand are there

1295
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:39,960
pesticides of this fertilizer so

1296
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:43,289
unfortunately often I can't really tell

1297
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,059
them much at all I wish I had better I

1298
00:51:43,289 --> 00:51:46,110
wish I had a better response for them

1299
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:49,489
but there's really not much I can tell

1300
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:53,460
them at all generally what I say is

1301
00:51:49,489 --> 00:51:56,759
don't replace it with what you're the

1302
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:58,760
kind of traditional established Western

1303
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,500
medicine is giving you don't replace it

1304
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,170
it's easy to get caught up in you know

1305
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:07,800
the the miraculous stories that we hear

1306
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:09,210
and and you know but I I would never

1307
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,800
recommend as a first-line treatment I

1308
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,380
would say if you're using Western

1309
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,460
medicine

1310
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,280
and you're using these prescription

1311
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:16,539
pills and you're not getting relief then

1312
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,130
at that point if you want to consider

1313
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:20,289
adding cannabis on top just understand

1314
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:23,230
the risks and the benefits and use it as

1315
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:24,940
what we call an adjunct an add-on to see

1316
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:31,539
if it can kind of enhance your overall

1317
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:33,639
response and that's kind of what I tell

1318
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:35,320
them and it's yeah I know it's a tough

1319
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:37,329
question because we none of us really

1320
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,920
have answers but we are kind of

1321
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:40,750
considered the experts right now these

1322
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,490
days cuz there really aren't a lot so

1323
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:44,320
you know it is interesting to just talk

1324
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:46,209
about it and say what do you say what do

1325
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,309
you do I mean I find for myself when I

1326
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:51,099
get the call which I do all the time

1327
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:54,429
unfortunately a lot of what my time is

1328
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:57,039
spent is just talking to them just just

1329
00:52:54,429 --> 00:52:59,649
talking just listening talking maybe

1330
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,670
suggesting hey you maybe want to go take

1331
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:02,950
a look at some of these things they

1332
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,990
might help you they might not I can't

1333
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:07,539
guarantee anything but it's just almost

1334
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:09,339
like having some information seems to

1335
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:10,659
give them a little bit of peace and I

1336
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,490
think that that's you know ultimately

1337
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:14,319
what we can be doing right now is saying

1338
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:16,269
well we can't guarantee anything but

1339
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,470
here's some things you could look at

1340
00:53:16,269 --> 00:53:19,829
here's some things you should research

1341
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:23,349
here's some things you can possibly try

1342
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:25,539
and maybe they'll help they've helped

1343
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:28,210
other people do you know feel better

1344
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:29,829
here so there's a chance that it might

1345
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:32,079
help you feel better too but there's a

1346
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:34,269
chance it might not so you know it but I

1347
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:38,409
think that as sort of just almost like

1348
00:53:34,269 --> 00:53:41,289
as a as an ear to just bend I think

1349
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:43,809
that's where I found myself so so let's

1350
00:53:41,289 --> 00:53:45,880
first of all thank Jeff Chen Rob Rosen

1351
00:53:43,809 --> 00:53:48,429
heck it's been incredible incredible

1352
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,980
thank you guys so much if there's any

1353
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:52,599
questions out there it's kind of hard to

1354
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,980
see but yeah alright we're gonna send

1355
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:56,949
one of these mics around well what do

1356
00:53:53,980 --> 00:54:03,250
you guys come or anybody here Peter grab

1357
00:53:56,949 --> 00:54:06,009
one of these microphones this guy thank

1358
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:09,039
you so much I'm a California attorney

1359
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:11,530
who's been concerned about the future of

1360
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:15,159
medical and when you look at Washington

1361
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:18,460
where it's essentially folded you look

1362
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:21,339
at Colorado where adult use market just

1363
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,929
utterly outstripping medical I don't

1364
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,430
know that there's an answer to this

1365
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:25,929
question I don't

1366
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:28,389
this questions really for anyone in the

1367
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:30,210
room who's got any good ideas whether at

1368
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:33,868
the local level or the state level

1369
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:38,530
anything that you think can be done to

1370
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:40,900
protect medical and keep it alive

1371
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:46,450
assuming you recognize it as something

1372
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:49,389
that could be under threat okay I can

1373
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:51,460
talk to you about from a state

1374
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:53,500
perspective we'll start there

1375
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:56,170
so prop 215 which is our medical

1376
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:58,960
marijuana laws here in California it

1377
00:54:56,170 --> 00:55:02,200
would take a constitutional amendment to

1378
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,780
undo prop 215 it's one of the reasons

1379
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:05,889
that prop 64 did not go down that path

1380
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,470
because it was going to be extremely

1381
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:11,230
complicated to undo it

1382
00:55:08,469 --> 00:55:14,829
so rather than undo it they folded in

1383
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:18,429
some protections into prop 64 for

1384
00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:21,340
medical and but then subsequently all

1385
00:55:18,429 --> 00:55:23,199
that's moved into now SB 94 and our

1386
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,510
regulations so how it's all gonna

1387
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:27,429
ultimately shake out I don't think

1388
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:31,180
anybody knows at this point but as of

1389
00:55:27,429 --> 00:55:34,118
right now this time our medical is still

1390
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:35,919
protected in California it it's hard to

1391
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:38,108
say how that will go down but the thing

1392
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,240
that happened in Washington was that

1393
00:55:38,108 --> 00:55:42,099
because the tax difference was so huge

1394
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:44,319
there was no incentive for people to go

1395
00:55:42,099 --> 00:55:45,880
to to adult use so nobody was opening up

1396
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,109
adult youth shops and so everyone just

1397
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,090
stayed in the medical and they went no

1398
00:55:47,108 --> 00:55:50,829
no no so they kind of shut medical

1399
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:52,570
folded it into adult use purely because

1400
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:54,608
everybody was trying to avoid the taxes

1401
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:56,859
I think we have a better system here we

1402
00:55:54,608 --> 00:56:00,608
learned from that as well but at this

1403
00:55:56,858 --> 00:56:02,590
point medical is here to stay for the

1404
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:04,358
time being I cannot predict what will

1405
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:05,950
happen in five years from now but I

1406
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:07,719
think we're safe for a little while

1407
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:09,279
because of the fact that it would take a

1408
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:11,559
constitutional amendment to undo prop

1409
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:18,550
215 that's about what I can contribute

1410
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:20,259
you guys all right I mean if you look at

1411
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,210
someone you were saying how you know the

1412
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:26,170
economic interests people tend to jump

1413
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:30,880
to adult use but if you look at the size

1414
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:32,740
of the healthcare sector in America or

1415
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,240
the size of the pharmaceutical industry

1416
00:56:32,739 --> 00:56:37,719
in America and you compare it to the

1417
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:39,879
size of the wine and beer market

1418
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:41,709
you can see that there's a lot more

1419
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,880
money in pharma than there is in selling

1420
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,710
like alcohol

1421
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,880
now I'm not again not trying to say that

1422
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,679
cannabis is alcohol I know a lot of

1423
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,059
people don't like that comparison but I

1424
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:50,980
would make the argument that from an

1425
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:52,119
economic standpoint there might actually

1426
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,420
even be more money

1427
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:57,880
servicing medical users than there is in

1428
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:58,869
selling to an adult use market because

1429
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,480
at the end of the day an adult use

1430
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:04,059
market you're battling over marketing

1431
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,800
who's who's got the sexier brand who's

1432
00:57:04,059 --> 00:57:07,659
got better distribution but in medical

1433
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,769
if you come up with a formulation that

1434
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:11,019
actually works for a certain condition

1435
00:57:08,769 --> 00:57:13,449
you've cracked the code on the terpenes

1436
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:15,630
and cannabinoids you just stumbled

1437
00:57:13,449 --> 00:57:19,899
across a billion-dollar formulation

1438
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:21,309
right so potentially maybe it's helping

1439
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,809
people realize that there is a ton of

1440
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:24,699
money in medical is just you maybe have

1441
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:26,679
to be more patient and when the money is

1442
00:57:24,699 --> 00:57:28,029
going to be made whereas with adult use

1443
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:29,589
you can kind of jump in now start

1444
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:33,070
building your brand but for medical

1445
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:35,200
really do putting that fixed cost R&amp;D

1446
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:36,550
development in the beginning maybe not

1447
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,489
being super propyl in the beginning but

1448
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:41,289
it's really the back end is is going

1449
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:44,739
under that and actually there's a path

1450
00:57:41,289 --> 00:57:48,130
going forward now for medical products

1451
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:49,809
derived from plants to get FDA approved

1452
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:51,010
you might want to look this up if you're

1453
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:53,349
remotely interested it's called the

1454
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:54,970
botanical drug category under the FDA

1455
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:57,670
it's only been around for the last four

1456
00:57:54,969 --> 00:58:01,029
years only two drugs have made it

1457
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:02,920
through that FDA botanical drug category

1458
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:05,080
one is a green tea extract for genital

1459
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:08,230
warts called Berggren the other is a

1460
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:12,039
Chinese herb for menstrual hot flashes

1461
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:14,230
both of them are plants you extract the

1462
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:16,119
plant put it in a pill and the FDA will

1463
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:19,179
give you clearance you can't patent the

1464
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:20,380
formula but you can have you're the only

1465
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:23,019
one that's allowed to say that this

1466
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:25,329
formula was FDA approved for general

1467
00:58:23,019 --> 00:58:27,099
warts or hot flashes and that's a

1468
00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:29,259
billion-dollar drug if you can come

1469
00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:31,119
across that formula and you can stumble

1470
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:33,190
look upon it and now what's even better

1471
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,140
and one last point I want to make about

1472
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:38,559
this what's even better is a pharma

1473
00:58:35,139 --> 00:58:40,809
company has to spend a lot of time and

1474
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:44,349
money undergoing clinical trials for

1475
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:46,119
their stuff but right now in cannabis if

1476
00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:47,920
you think you have a formula it works

1477
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:49,869
you kind of just sell it to people

1478
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,068
without having to spend a hundred

1479
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:52,778
million dollars on FDA

1480
00:58:51,068 --> 00:58:56,018
go trials so you can already kind of be

1481
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:57,849
testing your formula in a sense without

1482
00:58:56,018 --> 00:58:59,368
having to spend all that money so that's

1483
00:58:57,849 --> 00:59:04,630
another thing that could be valuable

1484
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:10,180
going forward that's great any other

1485
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:13,749
questions okay just a comment to your

1486
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:18,429
question which is the in my mind part of

1487
00:59:13,748 --> 00:59:21,548
the the gap between what to fill in that

1488
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:23,018
gap is really looking at education so

1489
00:59:21,548 --> 00:59:25,059
and what I mean by education isn't

1490
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:28,268
patient education but career technical

1491
00:59:25,059 --> 00:59:30,670
ed so if you go through the State Board

1492
00:59:28,268 --> 00:59:33,879
of Education and create a certified

1493
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:38,289
training that is career tech ed

1494
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:41,349
post-secondary on something around

1495
00:59:38,289 --> 00:59:42,729
cannabis and bud tending or whatever

1496
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:45,219
it's going to be so that you have people

1497
00:59:42,728 --> 00:59:48,248
who are actually trained to be able to

1498
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:50,229
be those kinds of patient advocates then

1499
00:59:48,248 --> 00:59:52,389
that's going to fill in a piece of the

1500
00:59:50,228 --> 00:59:55,478
market that's missing because right now

1501
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:57,759
one of the issues is if you're

1502
00:59:55,478 --> 01:00:00,458
especially if you're older or if you've

1503
00:59:57,759 --> 01:00:03,639
never consumed cannabis in any way and

1504
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:06,399
you walk into well I'm an Oregon so we

1505
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:08,858
can walk in right so for a wreck and we

1506
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,719
walk in what you're gonna get is people

1507
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:13,088
who can't answer it used to be that you

1508
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:15,329
could ask a question and your bud tender

1509
01:00:13,088 --> 01:00:18,458
at the dispensary would be able to say

1510
01:00:15,329 --> 01:00:20,380
well this is a flower you know or this

1511
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:22,028
is a strain that's known for this or

1512
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,009
this is a product that's good for this

1513
01:00:22,028 --> 01:00:25,659
and now you've just got a bunch of young

1514
01:00:24,009 --> 01:00:27,998
you know generally young people that

1515
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:30,759
don't really know anything that are not

1516
01:00:27,998 --> 01:00:34,179
able to give good information so I think

1517
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:36,489
a big piece is creating through and

1518
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:37,899
California has a really open State Board

1519
01:00:36,489 --> 01:00:40,228
of Education in terms of things that

1520
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:43,509
they'll approve creating some kind of

1521
01:00:40,228 --> 01:00:44,948
mechanism to get people in that so that

1522
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:47,380
would be that's one of the things I've

1523
01:00:44,949 --> 01:00:49,599
been emailed I have a question that's

1524
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:53,130
been kind of burning for a long time

1525
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:58,119
around medical product in adult use

1526
01:00:53,130 --> 01:01:00,400
around labeling and this piece of so I

1527
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:02,980
go in and I see a tincture and

1528
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,559
I say you know I'm in this in the same

1529
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:09,099
place that has a tincture topical and a

1530
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:12,130
flower so the flower I can the person

1531
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:14,380
can say to me it's this strain it's got

1532
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:16,660
this percentage it's been lab tested and

1533
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:19,900
it's got this percentage of THC and this

1534
01:01:16,659 --> 01:01:22,929
percentage of CBD data but my teacher

1535
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:25,180
doesn't tell me what strain it is maybe

1536
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:28,539
it says it's a hybrid maybe it says it's

1537
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:32,349
sativa maybe it says it's indica my

1538
01:01:28,539 --> 01:01:35,409
edible maybe it says any of that but I

1539
01:01:32,349 --> 01:01:38,049
know for myself medically that a lot of

1540
01:01:35,409 --> 01:01:41,199
what works for me is strain specific so

1541
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:43,720
I'm just curious your thoughts on how do

1542
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:45,579
we get more of the products that

1543
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:48,189
especially as we're going into adult use

1544
01:01:45,579 --> 01:01:51,789
how do we get doesn't in your opinion

1545
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:54,639
doesn't matter for topicals and tincture

1546
01:01:51,789 --> 01:01:56,860
tincture is to say this is a strain or

1547
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:58,420
is it it doesn't matter because it's all

1548
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:05,340
shake or it doesn't matter because it's

1549
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:05,340
all leaf for sure

1550
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:10,090
so streams when you're talking about a

1551
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:11,769
strain first of all there's a lot of

1552
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:14,620
string confusion because there's a lot

1553
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:16,360
of people who just call they make up

1554
01:02:14,619 --> 01:02:20,559
names or they'll take whatever they have

1555
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:24,220
and call it blue dream or whatever but

1556
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:25,719
when you talk about a strain and best

1557
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:27,459
practices are employed and you're

1558
01:02:25,719 --> 01:02:29,529
actually getting that strain the strain

1559
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:32,429
represents a collection of cannabinoids

1560
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:35,230
and turkeys and so you know this strain

1561
01:02:32,429 --> 01:02:38,799
gives me this desired effect because it

1562
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:41,440
has this much THC this much CBD these

1563
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,820
terpenes this profile and it assuming

1564
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,250
it's consistent you're gonna have this

1565
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:48,640
consistent experience as soon as you

1566
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:52,150
extract cannabis oil or some kind of

1567
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:54,449
concentrate from the plant you've

1568
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:56,769
disrupted its properties

1569
01:02:54,449 --> 01:02:59,919
and you've disrupted his properties

1570
01:02:56,769 --> 01:03:02,559
based on how it was primarily how it was

1571
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,780
extracted how much heat how much

1572
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:07,090
pressure and what kind of solvent is

1573
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:09,550
used so you could take the exact same

1574
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:12,280
flower and extract it ten different ways

1575
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:14,080
and get ten totally different

1576
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,480
cannabinoid profiles and

1577
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:18,039
terpene profiles in the extract that you

1578
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,530
got from the same flower so that creates

1579
01:03:18,039 --> 01:03:23,619
one complication there so if I told you

1580
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:26,050
I'm selling you loose blue dream as its

1581
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:28,869
train that you're gonna smoke and then I

1582
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:30,820
tell you here's a cookie that has blue

1583
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:34,599
dream extract in it it's really going to

1584
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:43,600
be dependent on how it was extracted so

1585
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:45,639
what you really eventful and can more

1586
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:48,789
consumer awareness so they understand oh

1587
01:03:45,639 --> 01:03:53,019
you know what I like a strain that's

1588
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:56,409
high in cbn with lemon een because

1589
01:03:53,019 --> 01:03:59,800
that's immutable regardless of what the

1590
01:03:56,409 --> 01:04:02,379
plant source is so you know the only way

1591
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:04,840
to really kind of predict the desired

1592
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:06,640
effect of a topical or anything anything

1593
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,940
that's a manufacturer product made from

1594
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:11,889
concentrate is to understand which

1595
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:14,679
cannabinoids and which combination and

1596
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:17,529
terpenes and potencies are left in the

1597
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:22,750
final product it's it's chemistry so

1598
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:24,400
it's not an easy answer but just just to

1599
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:26,349
add to that I complete with grief

1600
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,300
everything you said I think then we're

1601
01:04:26,349 --> 01:04:32,349
gonna move away from strain names and

1602
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:33,789
move towards hard numbers like here

1603
01:04:32,349 --> 01:04:35,589
here's the ratio that I like of these

1604
01:04:33,789 --> 01:04:38,710
certain terpenes are cannabinoids or

1605
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:40,809
even if we settle if you find that a

1606
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:42,010
specific formulation works for you then

1607
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:43,420
maybe that's the one that you're gonna

1608
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:46,630
go after and I think what's gonna happen

1609
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:48,190
is companies will create ten different

1610
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:50,559
formulations and if they can

1611
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:52,720
consistently make each one of those ten

1612
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,909
formulations they don't really need to

1613
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:56,739
say that this formulation is going to

1614
01:04:54,909 --> 01:04:58,719
produce euphoria versus creativity

1615
01:04:56,739 --> 01:05:01,959
versus sedation they just have to show

1616
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:04,000
that this is formula a and we make it

1617
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:05,980
consistently and our users will

1618
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,389
eventually self a sort to find the ones

1619
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:09,909
that they like and that's them if you

1620
01:05:07,389 --> 01:05:13,750
can crack that formula you're gonna sell

1621
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:15,219
a lot even the same strain you know

1622
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,960
first off like you said the strain aims

1623
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:19,149
are all messed up everyone's just making

1624
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,949
it up I wouldn't trust anything the odds

1625
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:22,720
that blue dream in this store is

1626
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:25,539
actually a related to the blue juve

1627
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:27,108
another story it's very slim but even

1628
01:05:25,539 --> 01:05:29,509
the same strain the same

1629
01:05:27,108 --> 01:05:30,650
nedick's batch to batch they're gonna be

1630
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,460
totally different like you even

1631
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:32,838
mentioned with the sugar leaves

1632
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,970
depending on where you are in the plant

1633
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:36,588
the ratio is gonna be completely

1634
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:38,268
different you know depending on whether

1635
01:05:36,588 --> 01:05:40,880
using sugar leaves there's this trim or

1636
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:43,459
says no vs. flower at the top versus

1637
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,989
flower on the bottom right and so if

1638
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:47,929
you're saying I locked in to this

1639
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:49,639
particular formulation from this strain

1640
01:05:47,929 --> 01:05:51,078
it's you're not gonna be able to find

1641
01:05:49,639 --> 01:05:53,838
that consistency so it's going to go

1642
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:56,059
likely to the derivatives the extracts

1643
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:58,548
and then really honing in on if you can

1644
01:05:56,059 --> 01:06:00,710
consistently produce a formula that has

1645
01:05:58,548 --> 01:06:02,568
the same amount of these 10 cannabinoids

1646
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:03,499
and these 10 terpenes we're getting

1647
01:06:02,568 --> 01:06:04,670
pretty close to something that's

1648
01:06:03,498 --> 01:06:06,528
consistent and then people will

1649
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:13,579
naturally self a sort to what they like

1650
01:06:06,528 --> 01:06:15,980
and what works for them cranky I so

1651
01:06:13,579 --> 01:06:17,210
that's great I am going to I know we

1652
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:19,338
have lots of questions these guys are

1653
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:20,838
gonna stick around so but I'm gonna wrap

1654
01:06:19,338 --> 01:06:23,630
this part of it and we're gonna finish

1655
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:25,998
off this event and and these guys will

1656
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:27,200
hang out so you come ask questions but I

1657
01:06:25,998 --> 01:06:29,118
really just want to thank you both

1658
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,719
because this has been so wonderful to

1659
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:34,789
talk about this these guys are great so

1660
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:36,969
please come up afterwards and talk to

1661
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:36,970
them

1662
