1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,440
it is redistribution for you where we

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,240
have our own distribution license we use

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,830
so we started with I've been friends

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,769
with Rhys for a long time but then they

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,179
changed like everybody else just don't

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,429
have control over what they're doing but

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,198
there are fulfillment partner so they do

8
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,689
all the last miles table so our real

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,949
focus is to besides cultivators just to

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,329
make sure that we do our own like

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,179
testing and packaging and all that stuff

12
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,559
and then we have a sales team so we keep

13
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,390
the relationships with the clubs because

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:35,600
we add them you know didn't want to give

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,600
them away to some you know the drill

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,989
[Music]

17
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,000
well you know what I can't speak to this

18
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:50,369
cultivar as much as the people that

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,730
farmed it so this is an example son

20
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:55,439
roots farm cultivation and this is a

21
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,698
great example for us because we're

22
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,039
always talking about son grow versus

23
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,628
endure and now that dates are on on

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,929
labeling everything all except that was

25
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:05,219
produced in October and it's July it's

26
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:06,329
like if the Sun grown and people in

27
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:07,739
Southern California starting to

28
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,539
understand the cycle of Sun grown and

29
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,789
the seasons of it all so this is a great

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,618
example of a flower that I can put in

31
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,240
front of a pyro couldn't be like bitches

32
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:16,709
in door and they're like oh that's great

33
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,219
and they're like essentially last year's

34
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,079
outdoor

35
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:24,170
so it's a great it's a really good

36
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,439
strain like the velvet perks it's a good

37
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,549
one

38
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,840
they've been rocking it for a while and

39
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:28,519
it's just it's still resonance and it

40
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,159
hold it's like it's got that sappiness

41
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,500
to it super high terpenes he's got that

42
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,189
SAP to it the kind of suspense it in

43
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,920
time nice yeah it's a good one it smokes

44
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,719
and fermium you know I could be like

45
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,189
opportunity to have a more anxious

46
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,629
feeling and so for like I got to be

47
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:46,129
careful about coffee and things like

48
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:48,289
guys so it's cannabis I'm pretty

49
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:50,478
sensitive to and this is such a it just

50
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,868
is very calming for me it makes me feel

51
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,640
good yeah it's a great example the Sun

52
00:01:53,868 --> 00:02:04,969
good nose kind of reminds me sweetheart

53
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:15,939
yeah it's super circular we control his

54
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:15,939
roll a joint yeah see

55
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,260
[Music]

56
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:23,259
yeah

57
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:32,318
your own farm can also work

58
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:34,419
exactly exactly yeah uh only thing that

59
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,079
I call debate on is the 2500 square-foot

60
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:38,979
license

61
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,590
I ended Mendocino in the community over

62
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:44,729
the last like really over the last like

63
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,689
five years there's been a big push to

64
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,310
other people trying to sell their

65
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:52,359
flowers through us and we'll get to

66
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,949
retail yeah for sure yeah we have Ingrid

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,390
over there absolutely that's a good

68
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:57,818
example of one that was in the Sun way

69
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:59,439
too long today and I'm like it's not

70
00:02:57,818 --> 00:03:03,069
exactly how I want to look it's a

71
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:05,199
beautiful strain but yeah so really one

72
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:07,930
of my I think one of my strengths more

73
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,669
than cultivation it was was going out

74
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,439
and being the voice of a group of us

75
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:12,458
that were cultivating rather than

76
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,900
someone coming in and saying yeah I

77
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,120
gotta sell your herb for you it's like

78
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,129
hey guys I'll do it I'll fucking get out

79
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,360
there and do it so that's gonna shop we

80
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:22,889
cultivate a little bit but really it's

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,890
an aggregation of a lot of small farms

82
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:30,239
Wow and we took in a little bit of a

83
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:34,799
different approach like talking trees we

84
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,030
just it's all single source but there's

85
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,230
also that need to help out other

86
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,449
community too so we're gonna develop

87
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:41,489
another brand so that what like this

88
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,399
mountain is brand and then we can like

89
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,530
co-brand other farms but the talking

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,510
tree it's like we know if we oh it's

91
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,479
just we grew it we know everything about

92
00:03:48,509 --> 00:04:13,620
it if it sucks we're gonna take yeah

93
00:03:51,479 --> 00:04:17,159
it's our farm la seems to me to be the

94
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,379
hardest to tap and the smallest volumes

95
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,420
we like we see compared to some Bay Area

96
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,339
stores tend to go deeper

97
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,680
I think la there's so much so if you do

98
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:28,500
get in a store maybe they'll order sizes

99
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,319
at least to our experience so far the

100
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:35,120
volume of the orders aren't as big let's

101
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,120
say norcal or in our own backyard

102
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:41,370
there's so many more players and more

103
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,050
competition I guess it's so different

104
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,290
it's so different than the Northern

105
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,449
California market - as far as like you

106
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,939
get a lot of like the like and get in

107
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,469
door 417 you know

108
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,719
there's a lot of indoor being cultivated

109
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,280
in Los Angeles and I think there's still

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,850
a lot of education needs to go in and

111
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,549
sun-grown

112
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,760
to get more momentum than that in the

113
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,590
market down here it's it's a lot I mean

114
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,079
just just our experience down here over

115
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:09,889
the last year or cycads it is incredible

116
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,599
how many people are unaware of the

117
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:14,759
agricultural cycle of the seasons of

118
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,430
cannabis and when something they want

119
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,480
something full Sun and in it and it was

120
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,889
harvested in December and they're

121
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,300
getting adjourned I could see it's like

122
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,579
oh wow you didn't know that this was

123
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:31,170
harvested because that's when that's the

124
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:39,599
end of it yeah we do make some pretty

125
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:41,970
rolls for sure probably rather had

126
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,360
someone start with like flour and make

127
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,360
their own

128
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,120
fireproof oh I I go to I would go in my

129
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:53,529
store and get a free roll first thing

130
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,209
just cuz like if I'm traveling or moving

131
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:57,429
around it's easy just to grab a pre roll

132
00:05:55,209 --> 00:06:01,779
and I'm a flower guy I'd rather smoke a

133
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:03,850
joint than a bowl or yeah I'm totally a

134
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:06,699
flower guy that's where a flower flower

135
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,330
to the end and the pre-roll market is so

136
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,800
like people are really in timid

137
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:12,969
fortunate like there's a lot of product

138
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,100
today people don't know what to do with

139
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,150
the natural makes it into a pre-roll but

140
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,890
I'm sure like these guys like we

141
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:20,319
basically we take our flowers and we

142
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,550
grade them there all of the a buds and

143
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,409
things that we decide not to put into

144
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,240
1/8 jars what a pre-roll it's turned

145
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,520
into so it's not like you're taking trim

146
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:38,259
and they're taking random things you

147
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:39,939
know they gotta go quick you know cuz

148
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:42,610
once you break it down and starts to

149
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:45,129
degrade so I mean we tried to go for a

150
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,449
model of like packed or you know packed

151
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:47,199
to order pre-rolled order which you

152
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,860
can't do anymore

153
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,360
because the testing change but we just

154
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,759
can't keep up so it's like we're just

155
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,530
constantly really really rolls and

156
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,420
they're out the door and feel good about

157
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:01,319
that I hate this even sit around for a

158
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,319
month and then go out

159
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,209
what's your best-selling

160
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:14,930
like which was like probably the budget

161
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,930
flower like a nine $10 eight

162
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,348
[Music]

163
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:25,319
we've got a little bit I mean the live

164
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:28,098
markets a little hard to crack there's

165
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,348
so many players and prices are low and

166
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:35,579
we've done really well at bubble ash

167
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:38,968
we're doing really well with my wife we

168
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:42,118
just do full spectrum 70 you good old

169
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:46,699
bubble hash ten dollars a gram wholesale

170
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:50,879
so hits the customers about 20-25 and

171
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:53,968
yeah all that and then we use it for all

172
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:59,879
our edibles our ice water hash and fused

173
00:07:53,968 --> 00:08:03,930
as well yeah this is still funny how it

174
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:07,408
all like full-circle BHO okay gonna

175
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:10,168
bubble hash I mean I always straight

176
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:11,938
away from the solvent world and just ugh

177
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:13,558
I all make bubble hash when we go ash

178
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:16,259
and then we use it for like Space Jam

179
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:18,869
and the tea is and stuff so and then it

180
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,920
just returns like oh well bubble ash

181
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:26,550
what we sell more than anything

182
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,550
I mean us

183
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:31,730
if you were making this in Europe people

184
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,799
would be like we have European people

185
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:38,300
hitting us up trying to buy it it's

186
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:39,228
crazy it's like mobile guys or and

187
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,879
they're like oh we're coming to the

188
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,030
United States and we love Sour Diesel

189
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:47,350
and want to buy a lie-down my well we

190
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,350
can't tell it to you sorry

191
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:57,838
bill days good it's great

192
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:02,278
I mean I've always rather smoking

193
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:06,839
sun-grown over in door myself you guys

194
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:09,088
do indoor - yeah you guys as far as the

195
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,070
um so you guys are cultivating yourself

196
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:15,089
well permis you guys out what purpose do

197
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:17,790
you guys have I have five outdoor

198
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:20,430
permits one under five thousand into our

199
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:22,980
permit and a micro business permit that

200
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:31,289
includes cultivation nursery specialty

201
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:32,990
indoor distribution and retail I have

202
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:35,519
nine permits

203
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:38,870
yeah Humboldt County man there's

204
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,549
definitely like that's always the

205
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,929
balance between small farmers being able

206
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:44,669
to scale up a little bit to be able to

207
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:46,889
actually throwing up to penetrate the

208
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:48,599
market it's easy to aggregate when

209
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,490
you're acting like a 2500 square foot in

210
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,290
the 5000 square foot and a 2500 square

211
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,299
foot you actually end up being maybe the

212
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:57,179
canopy that's similar to what you have

213
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:59,370
with the fiber material CDFA is like the

214
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:02,879
word CDMA is the worse than getting per

215
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:06,720
mass yeah yeah getting permits is not

216
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:10,649
easy at all still no BCC is much easier

217
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,600
than CDF a CDF age it's like really

218
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:15,179
difficult and taking forever and moving

219
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,500
slow or as if you have a micro business

220
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:20,639
or retail or their distribution or CD pH

221
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,620
manufacturing permits I seem to all be

222
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,578
so much easier than getting a

223
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,578
cultivation for a minute

224
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,890
[Music]

225
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,029
well I work with three different local

226
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:38,259
municipalities city of Eureka city of

227
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:40,439
Arcadia and then Humboldt County the

228
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:43,480
county has always been the hardest

229
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,900
Eureka was the last to come on but is

230
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,460
like the easiest they they did they

231
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:50,500
actually hosted the best campus mixer

232
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,170
I've ever been to like a week or two ago

233
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,200
so they've issued 59 permits in the last

234
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:58,719
year give or take in the city of Eureka

235
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,580
City of Eureka and so they brought in

236
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,620
like a half a million in permit fees

237
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,410
that they like they gave us all these

238
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,730
statistics it's created this many jobs

239
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:07,539
it's bringing this much money into the

240
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,970
economy

241
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:12,669
we love cannabis there's one building

242
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:15,040
that was empty for 14 years until the

243
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:17,229
cannabis business moved in so it's like

244
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:25,740
even the city sees a great economic

245
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:27,909
story and it's good to see ya yeah so

246
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,370
they're getting easier the locals are

247
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:33,939
getting easier I think unless you're

248
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,379
dealing with cdfw is also the nightmare

249
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,420
when it comes to cultivation dealing

250
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:39,419
with fish and wildlife is very hard

251
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:50,080
July 1st there's a new waterboard

252
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:51,310
regulation I I diffused that stuff to

253
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,250
other people I don't remember the

254
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:55,989
details but a new waterboard enrollment

255
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,750
and here at ready that's gross has to be

256
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:02,759
enrolled with the waterboard and so

257
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:06,339
they're rolling out a whole new program

258
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:08,439
they have to be signed on a lot of a lot

259
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:09,910
of cultivators that a lot of friends

260
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,500
people that I know with perfect sir

261
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:13,719
they're in scientific review right now

262
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,208
so they're waiting on their provisional

263
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,040
license and they're fairness like

264
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:23,309
suspended state waiting around CDMA yeah

265
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:25,740
so I can see

266
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,448
yeah so hopefully they'll start to turn

267
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,620
on when do you decide what you're gonna

268
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:33,299
grow for the coming season well the form

269
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,159
that we have is supposed to the coast

270
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:36,539
so we Rock genetics out there that we've

271
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,980
been doing just because they work well

272
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:39,419
in those environments and conditions

273
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,740
when you go closer to the coast you

274
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:45,229
definitely have to be thinking as far as

275
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,230
like folds and things like that so

276
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:50,850
watermelon ranchers really really great

277
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:54,208
it's been a great strain the a.k is

278
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:56,399
another strain that I don't know exactly

279
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:58,049
why it works so well out there but this

280
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,789
particular cut works so well something a

281
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:01,799
little school classic okay it's big

282
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:05,009
fucking resinous buds but they don't

283
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,469
mold out and we rock this Ellie's gift

284
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:09,449
out there and that's what we're doing

285
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,709
again so that's what you know that's

286
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:11,789
what we've been doing and then everybody

287
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,679
else in the group would kind of like you

288
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:16,318
it's like people have been cultivating

289
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,429
the same genetics for a long time first

290
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:18,838
up breeding and trying to do different

291
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,370
things but a lot of people just setting

292
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,290
up the same thing that they did they

293
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,028
knocked out last year mark and she'll be

294
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:25,469
registering the grapefruit like he's

295
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:28,198
doing the Viper cookies gabe is doing

296
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,550
the ingrid so people go with what they

297
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:31,889
know it's definitely once you change it

298
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:33,028
up it's it can be a rabbit hole and

299
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:36,419
fives you know I mean finding a cure

300
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:40,078
genetic is it's not easy to come by it's

301
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:41,549
a lot of fucking work so yeah we do a

302
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,128
little bit of both you know there's a

303
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:46,378
few staples like for now that could

304
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:49,350
change with like skittles through the

305
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:51,600
huckleberry buddy work we're trying to

306
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,180
get like over a year ahead and work on

307
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,909
new genetics and trying to just come out

308
00:13:54,179 --> 00:14:00,019
with new strains every year but that's

309
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,019
like a work in progress

310
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,740
well we did a lot of crosses last year

311
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:11,320
and we've got this really good pink

312
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,690
lemonade nail and so we just back crop

313
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,230
we've just crossed that with skittles

314
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,540
like Tahoe cookies candy land a bunch of

315
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:22,000
stuff golden lemons so we just popped

316
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:25,629
all those seeds so now we're gonna you

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,580
know be no Hunnam flower all indoor and

318
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:30,100
just kind of pick the winners and then

319
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:33,459
try and build those up for next season

320
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,500
and try and just at least have something

321
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:39,009
in our profile it's always just brand

322
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:42,009
new and hopefully of the next big strain

323
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:44,259
you never know so when you from the time

324
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:45,730
like we start the process to the time

325
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,559
you find something to the time it's

326
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,659
actually ready in the market at least

327
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:52,409
two years right people that people know

328
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:55,000
yeah yeah yeah it takes a long time yeah

329
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:57,669
breeding in getting a stable good

330
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,278
genetic outage is a definitely a process

331
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:02,439
so everything you're doing is wasn't it

332
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:04,958
started last month as we've been working

333
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,180
on for almost a year already by growing

334
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,479
in picking the selections the male's

335
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:12,789
were grown last year we cloned or kept

336
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,300
the pollen ideal we try to keep the

337
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:18,370
pollen in the clones so they do the

338
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:19,599
initial cross with the with the pollen

339
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,970
that we save and then we can keep the

340
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,220
clones going and produce more of that

341
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,930
same falling well first off do you think

342
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,100
that people should have the ability to

343
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:31,069
patent their strains

344
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,629
I don't really have an whole question

345
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,300
yeah yeah sure so I guess I'm just gonna

346
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:37,879
say I wouldn't you know I would say that

347
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:40,849
the key the key play is just to keep it

348
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,679
really tight and get win a couple cuffs

349
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,409
enter it into things negative

350
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,849
recognition let people know work with

351
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:48,500
the people that you got the genetics

352
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,959
from if they're breeders as well give

353
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,299
them the recognition and just make it on

354
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,289
the string yeah I think like so it's

355
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:56,419
like you don't have to trademark

356
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:58,159
something if you are the one that's

357
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:59,179
known for doing it and if you decide if

358
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,469
you build it up and then you decide to

359
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:02,328
give it to somebody else to do it then

360
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,769
it's like they can do it because you've

361
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,828
given it to them but it's not talking

362
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:09,889
trees so the brain goes a long way to

363
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:12,289
protect the genetic itself I'm I see why

364
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:14,568
people would do it but it's just not my

365
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:16,549
thing I'd rather share something great

366
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:17,479
with everybody and let them play with it

367
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:19,519
and see what they do with it I think

368
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,649
that's I think that's art you know

369
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,318
that's cool yeah breeding and like plant

370
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:27,559
patents and and all that has been a huge

371
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:29,509
like huge conversation and cannabis

372
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:30,439
community these days with everything

373
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:33,740
that's been happening with Pylos

374
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:37,360
bioscience and all that stuff so 20

375
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:41,709
times what do you want

376
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,480
what do you feel like smoke really good

377
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:48,609
any flower madam just a chunk rough yeah

378
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,610
flower for sure see what we got here

379
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,370
that's all we have is indoor right now

380
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:05,919
try the huckleberry what's up with you

381
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:10,029
guys this much distribution working for

382
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,259
you guys okay we do I do all my own

383
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,990
distribution through high grade

384
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:16,269
distribution and I mean it's going

385
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:20,309
pretty good it's a lot of work but we're

386
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:24,180
in probably over 120 stores now so

387
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:27,129
moving I mean we sold out of flour so

388
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,049
and I mean I did try like you know

389
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,160
putting getting some of the homies I'm

390
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,779
like oh I know you're you know a good

391
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,710
grower haven't seen your crop in a few

392
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:38,410
years but and people notice and so it's

393
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,279
like my reps were getting upset I'm like

394
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,540
well dude you're the one that's not

395
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,149
making any money if we're not selling

396
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:44,619
flour so we're gonna we already

397
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,990
developed a brand and then it'll be like

398
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:49,569
alright we can you know showcase other

399
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,460
farms through that brand and just kind

400
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:54,369
of run this branding a single source and

401
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:58,799
when we run out it's out that's kind of

402
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:58,799
like it's seasonal product yeah

403
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:09,288
[Music]

404
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:12,589
and a current volume of cannon just

405
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:15,210
learned in the last season is that

406
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:19,499
probably have enough this is like you

407
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:22,528
know last year it was like making moves

408
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:23,788
where every had to make moves but we

409
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:25,108
have the cultivation campy that can

410
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:29,759
probably get us through about a year

411
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:32,249
supply as we're growing and that's good

412
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,028
it's part of it as well you guys when

413
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:37,139
you got the end or but you've been

414
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:38,940
harvesting already my end or I'm only at

415
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:40,589
1200 square feet built out right now

416
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,298
justice I have the permits but not the

417
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:44,238
money for the build outs but we have

418
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:49,319
forty nine thousand square foot outdoor

419
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:52,169
you know thirty low thirty thousand of

420
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:56,158
its mostly mixed green house alone tarps

421
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:57,190
so we start harvesting first second week

422
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,169
in July

423
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,990
a little little bit a little bit behind

424
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:06,538
this year I like to harvest on like

425
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:09,220
fourth of July I'll be about a week late

426
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:10,929
because I mean where I'm at and just in

427
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,548
my light depths in general almost

428
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:14,548
everything finishes about a week earlier

429
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:23,230
well I mean right now we're not

430
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:28,630
harvesting anything and on the outdoor

431
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:31,839
scale from you know October through July

432
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:35,070
and then July it'll be non-stop until

433
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:38,189
October always harvesting

434
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:38,189
[Music]

435
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:49,960
yeah yeah I'm not selling any bull so if

436
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:52,120
I sell bulk I'm gonna help friends out

437
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,390
and sell their product is bull and only

438
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:58,538
do package for my my flowers today I

439
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:00,880
mean right now we're still in in the

440
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:04,419
growth phase and could've sold a lot

441
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,720
more weed if I had it but we made it to

442
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:09,280
like May what some still having flower

443
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,339
and we're planning to produce you know

444
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,500
more this year every year we add more

445
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:16,779
fans we added this that you know like

446
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:29,679
it's always getting better the

447
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:31,298
infrastructures so yeah the huckleberry

448
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,298
is a strain that actually got from a

449
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:36,940
father-in-law of mine that was bred I

450
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:40,329
think out in Trinity and so Trinity

451
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,860
County so we got seeds of it and grew it

452
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:44,439
for two different seasons to just be no

453
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:47,168
hunted what we call we label the

454
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,659
huckleberry but it's the huckleberry

455
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:56,409
three is the pheno so it's really nice

456
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:59,250
like fruity uplifting tasty bud so we

457
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:59,250
can roll join attack

458
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,818
[Music]

459
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:23,798
[Music]

460
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:29,370
I think that's true but I think they

461
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:31,200
have smaller limits on like canopy and

462
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:33,449
stuff but probably easier to deal with

463
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,429
in terms of the grading and stuff like

464
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,679
that but when you're dealing with cdfw

465
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:40,230
there's cdfw and their state widening

466
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,780
they're not county and and they're gonna

467
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:45,269
be your biggest nightmare yeah as an

468
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:46,918
outdoor grill were in the Hills CD I

469
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:48,058
mean they have been for me maybe other

470
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,030
people's are different stories are

471
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:52,529
different but most people I know in the

472
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:55,168
Hills are humble that's been their

473
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:58,440
biggest hurdle to get a permit to cdfw

474
00:21:55,169 --> 00:22:00,960
and advise the farmer and that's doubly

475
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,558
the case for sure all the local AG

476
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,380
department and the Cal Fire and naval

477
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,990
Water Board like state inspectors but

478
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,760
Fish and Wildlife simply have some

479
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,960
serious business

480
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,809
don't give a fuck about cannabis and

481
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,960
their job is to protect Fish and

482
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:22,099
Wildlife you know so but it's been good

483
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,100
you know but yeah a lot of hurdles

484
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:43,660
do I not necessarily not not so much

485
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:46,480
yeah I mean I think everybody has the

486
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:52,630
right to cultivate and their quality is

487
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:55,240
quality so I think Appalachian I think

488
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:58,450
like I don't know I think that yeah

489
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,069
we'll see how it all rose I mean I

490
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,600
believe there's definitely something to

491
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:04,809
it because even the girl office a great

492
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:08,349
example of it you can give ten growers

493
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:10,329
the same exact cutting and even on

494
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:11,829
indoor I mean you give ten growers the

495
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:13,779
same indoor cut it's all gonna come out

496
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:14,710
different so I just kind of speaks to

497
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:17,889
like yeah there's something to

498
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,420
Appalachia and I mean nothing against

499
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,730
Salinas or Santa Barbara or anywhere

500
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,039
that's growing but elevation definitely

501
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,140
can play a key and a lot of men Dohan

502
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:28,869
below Trinity here between that six

503
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:33,690
hundred two thousand foot elevation is

504
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:33,689
pretty prime cannabis growing weather

505
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,659
plumbing it's just you have to you

506
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,220
definitely have to have earlybird

507
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:46,720
strange I've never stuck that comes down

508
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,089
earlier

509
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,860
unless you're pulling tarps but for us

510
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:52,720
we're doing a full season crop out on

511
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:53,949
the coast so you know we don't want

512
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,829
strains that are going to be going to

513
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:59,200
too far into you know late September

514
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:01,089
ideally they're all coming down just

515
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,038
strange to do well strains that are Airy

516
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:05,678
you're no stranger to luck you know that

517
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,179
are going to grow and there allow good

518
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,419
light to come through and air play the

519
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:12,130
program and the trick is just like not

520
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:14,590
you know giving them exactly what they

521
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,809
need and building the soil out there for

522
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:17,980
a while and it's it's a I think one of

523
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:19,839
the biggest things out in the coast is

524
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,980
just not over watering when you're in

525
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,058
the valley and you have like super high

526
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,720
temperatures it's a whole different

527
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:30,000
animal but on the coast just less is

528
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,000
more more oxygens good

529
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:37,569
okay guys smells good

530
00:24:42,779 --> 00:25:04,990
amazing that is amazing I wish I could

531
00:24:47,529 --> 00:25:06,369
do that dry farm is definitely because

532
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,620
you're really close to the water source

533
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:10,659
on the riverbed stuff you gotta grow the

534
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:12,939
right strains because you're gonna deal

535
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,490
with a lot of moisture similar to

536
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,200
growing on the coast but that mean it's

537
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,089
amazing I've been I visit a couple dry

538
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,370
farms it's like wow you never water

539
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:23,139
these plants you plant them they're like

540
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:25,509
yeah they droop like the first week and

541
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:30,720
then they just come back up and do their

542
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:30,720
thing pretty cool

543
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:36,789
wish I could do that but I'd say in

544
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,930
general a lot of a lot of farmers

545
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:44,529
typically historically do overwater

546
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,529
that's super juicy

547
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:50,549
so yeah we try to conserve as much water

548
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,549
as possible

549
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,019
what are you like

550
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,798
[Music]

551
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,798
[Applause]

552
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:14,759
ya know we're always experimenting and

553
00:26:12,358 --> 00:26:16,989
nothing really through the methodology I

554
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:19,239
mean there's like some hot strains out

555
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:23,200
there or some breeders that are putting

556
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:24,548
out new new genetics so we're trying to

557
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,440
play with it all I don't know it's quite

558
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:28,778
it's part of the fun of it for me it's

559
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,249
just seeing all the varieties of

560
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:35,858
cannabis one strain I've been liking a

561
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:37,419
lot lately that I could enjoy the

562
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:40,388
breeder off the top of my head is the

563
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:42,599
lemon Royale it's a really nice really

564
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:46,088
nice

565
00:26:42,598 --> 00:26:47,648
it's that lemony let me not let me just

566
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:54,509
scent and he's got a little bit of a

567
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:54,508
doji cushy lemon just yumminess to it

568
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,869
[Music]

569
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:11,240
it's a good one it's been my favorite

570
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:13,158
lately - yeah well honestly now there's

571
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,450
another criterias like we go ahead and

572
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,879
like oh this is awesome

573
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:19,788
let's do the potency test because

574
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:22,038
unfortunately we're dealing with that

575
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:25,009
bias and we'd rather have stuff that's

576
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:28,099
gonna be like oh it's over 25% okay yeah

577
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:30,618
like yeah if it's amazing but and tests

578
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:33,980
at 14 15 percent it's like well we'll

579
00:27:30,618 --> 00:27:39,648
keep it around but unfortunately people

580
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:42,710
bye-bye that we actually Terp test all

581
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:46,008
our smokeable so we have with you know

582
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:49,610
Terps are important and where there's

583
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:51,169
more just beyond Terps and THC can

584
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:52,969
happen but there's more going on - like

585
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:56,450
synergies of it because even some of the

586
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:59,899
better strains that get me really high

587
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,190
I've low turfs in low cannabinoids

588
00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:06,969
sometime so there's obviously something

589
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:06,970
else there's all kinds of factors

590
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:20,680
that's super bummed super tasty it's all

591
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:23,879
our indoors soil grown te organic yeah

592
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,880
just smaller amount

593
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,670
[Music]

594
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:43,720
I mean we I think it just produces a

595
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:45,129
better tasting product growing in I've

596
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,829
personally never done anything beside

597
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,360
soil but I've seen and been around a lot

598
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:51,490
of different systems and I know like the

599
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:54,240
flood drain systems work really well

600
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:56,950
all the grodan systems I mean there's

601
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,660
those are more efficient and tend to be

602
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,450
higher yield so from a business

603
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:05,019
standpoint it does make more sense to go

604
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:07,150
and more hydro cents even though they're

605
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:09,910
growing great quality cannabis - I mean

606
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:14,169
I smoke something's really good but I've

607
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:15,790
just always preferred soil just a

608
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,340
preference and I think the Terps come

609
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:21,039
out a little stronger and I've heard of

610
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:23,139
extractors that extract with product say

611
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,789
that they get a better extract out of

612
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:29,880
the same strain if it was soil grown

613
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:29,879
versus say salt grown hydro style

614
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:38,289
No we blend like you know products we

615
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:41,139
get thankfully we work with this company

616
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:44,769
called still escape solutions that Sam's

617
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:46,120
great yeah yeah he's great so he's

618
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:47,589
actually developed this folio I've

619
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:50,500
always been kind of an anti foliar

620
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:52,240
person but he's like just you gotta try

621
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:55,089
you gotta try it so we've been trying it

622
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,430
and it's amazing it's like all these

623
00:29:55,089 --> 00:30:02,169
micro minerals I mean I think there's

624
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:04,600
like 18 ingredients in it but it's true

625
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,850
you use like three mils to like a

626
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:08,409
hundred gallons or something like don't

627
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:10,839
quote me on the ratios and stuff but

628
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:17,500
it's extremely low amount and it's a

629
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:19,629
very effective very very effective yeah

630
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,549
he helps us develop the right program to

631
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:26,380
keep plants really healthy all

632
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:31,169
organically I'm not a soil scientist or

633
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,170
a Bobby so we got to rely on time

634
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:40,210
not so much I mean I've been doing it a

635
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:44,229
long time I mean I used to buy my own

636
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:46,489
nutrients and lime and dolomite and

637
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:49,940
blend it all together the back Juana's

638
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:51,919
and stuff but when someone else could

639
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,169
just do that and we're balanced ratio

640
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,629
based off like testing the soil and

641
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:59,059
develop a program and get you know I'm

642
00:30:56,628 --> 00:31:00,858
just like tossing it in like this really

643
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:02,839
you know it's what I've learned so

644
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:05,868
nothing that was like amazed like my

645
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:08,449
that necessarily but just like the

646
00:31:05,868 --> 00:31:14,228
specific knowledge of the balance of

647
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:18,288
what to be giving it pretty much yeah

648
00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:24,288
but it was always working I'm good

649
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:27,729
actually are you like the person like

650
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:27,729
I've never done by fraud

651
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:35,740
or you like bring someone in like

652
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:38,109
whatever it is well I tried to only

653
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:41,919
focus on non solve it you know solving

654
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:43,779
list solving free products but we have

655
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,970
started making live resins as well but

656
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:47,230
we don't we outsource that with her

657
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,569
actually we partner with a guy named

658
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:52,740
half hash so he does all our high end

659
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:52,740
hash productions

660
00:31:53,970 --> 00:32:02,740
yeah yeah so he manufactures all our

661
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:05,048
hash you know we try to work with people

662
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,929
that you know bring value to each other

663
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:10,240
by working together we can't just do it

664
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:12,460
all it's good to develop good

665
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,950
partnerships and that's what kind of

666
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:17,048
what space gems is is she had an amazing

667
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:20,890
product and brand and we started working

668
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:24,849
together and so now we collab more like

669
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:26,950
right now we're using kavita's I must

670
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:29,048
say I really like the controller's the

671
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,330
system where they all you can control

672
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:35,139
them light dim them and temperature

673
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:38,230
settings but we'll be looking into as we

674
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,940
remodel we're still not built up to

675
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,538
scale for the permit so we'll be looking

676
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,538
at other options

677
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:48,269
try it there's always something new to

678
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:50,999
learn and this is in this game you're

679
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:52,558
killing about testing coming up

680
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:55,048
are you feel about testing and all that

681
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:59,369
shit oh man testing is such a burden

682
00:32:55,048 --> 00:33:02,128
yeah it's so expensive especially

683
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:03,869
they're just like the most organic

684
00:33:02,128 --> 00:33:05,189
farmer ever can you know it's like it's

685
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:08,069
gonna trip eat the table too thick heavy

686
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:10,700
metals to shit like that that's kind of

687
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:13,678
why we went with this foliar program and

688
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,149
we hadn't we hadn't failed anything for

689
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,470
heavy metals yet when we started testing

690
00:33:15,148 --> 00:33:25,189
at the end of last year but uh what we

691
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:27,868
did fail before was Aspergillus and so

692
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:32,909
there's Sam soil escape as I go that's

693
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:35,638
coming from an over ripened fungal class

694
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:38,100
so we were making fungal flats you know

695
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:39,689
try to get the fungal biology going but

696
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,538
there's like such a short window and if

697
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:46,080
you're not microscope and if it blooms

698
00:33:41,538 --> 00:33:50,450
then that somehow Boston or that does

699
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:53,609
that created them fungus Aspergillus so

700
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:59,548
yeah trivia we've had any issues with

701
00:33:53,609 --> 00:34:02,119
the heavy metals don't wait hopefully

702
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:04,710
things change the name

703
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:06,959
like bees enough of some of that but

704
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:10,250
probably gonna Rd everything just to be

705
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:16,340
safe just to be safe because there's

706
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:16,340
some just shift it into another source

707
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:33,659
know where we have our own nursery but

708
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:37,190
it's between four different facilities

709
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:37,190
but it's all in how

710
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,229
[Music]

711
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:53,717
do I do everything

712
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,718
[Music]

713
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,108
right I mean I think you got allocated

714
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:05,630
about 25 to 30 percent of your total

715
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:08,539
space and most most municipalities don't

716
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,789
charge for nursery space so tack that on

717
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,858
and they usually just give you that as

718
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:15,079
you needed that and I mean usually you

719
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:17,989
need about to propagate I'd say for

720
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,108
indoor you can get away with 25% that

721
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:25,088
moms and self-sufficient clone

722
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:25,088
production and keep 75% flowering

723
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:37,420
I would like to I don't really have the

724
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:39,370
source or the funds to pay someone to do

725
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,579
that right now but I'd like to tissue

726
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:46,239
culture everything and start fresh as we

727
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:48,039
move into like a new facilities just to

728
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,589
make sure get rid of pathogens and stuff

729
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:52,900
I mean just to revive your the genetics

730
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:55,500
that you're working with but I haven't

731
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,500
got it done yet

732
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:05,329
you know a lot of farmers who would love

733
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:10,199
to fish you culture their genetics

734
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:13,140
getting back to Ground Zero is a good

735
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,029
way to preserve them save for later you

736
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:17,069
don't take up space like God it's not

737
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:21,610
good right now but I don't want to lose

738
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:22,700
it just catalog it in tissue culture I

739
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:26,690
[Music]

740
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:26,689
do have a story yeah yeah

741
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:36,690
the retail stores yeah

742
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,320
the retail stores definitely helped a

743
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:43,980
lot because it brings in cash flow every

744
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,559
day and it's been pretty successful so

745
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,570
on my model with the store is that way

746
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,269
you know a nice clean environment but

747
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,730
also just to support everybody anyone

748
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:55,949
has a good product we give a chance so

749
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,389
we have a lot of different broader did

750
00:36:55,949 --> 00:37:03,029
McKinley bill which is in northern

751
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:06,809
Humboldt the clientele is super diverse

752
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:11,070
so I would say our clientele averages

753
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:13,380
probably between thirty to sixty and a

754
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:16,230
lot more frequently we're seeing a lot

755
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:19,710
of more elder older folks coming in a

756
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:22,710
lot of people new people yeah even in

757
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:26,070
humble choosing so a lot of new people a

758
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:27,329
lot of curious people younger people

759
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,900
they know what they want

760
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,900
coming in

761
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,879
I can't say that we've seen much demand

762
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,740
for that but like we have brought in

763
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:51,230
products from lemon tree and say alien

764
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:53,298
labs and editor at a really premium

765
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:56,510
price like like how are we gonna sell a

766
00:37:53,298 --> 00:37:58,818
$70 a thin humble and the product sells

767
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:01,250
that sold I don't think it was an issue

768
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:04,460
you know I don't work in the store

769
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:06,079
monitor too much but I know we brought

770
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,358
in some very high-end product I was like

771
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,519
wow how's this gonna fly and humble

772
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:13,190
people we're still buying it so I think

773
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:15,588
there's such a diverse consumer out

774
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,990
there so as a store it's like we like to

775
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:20,719
offer something for everybody I mean

776
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:22,969
like a cheap ten to twenty dollar eight

777
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:24,798
is actually the highest volume selling

778
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:27,739
product when we have a good stock of

779
00:38:24,798 --> 00:38:29,030
them where we live but then there's also

780
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:33,759
people that come in for the super

781
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:33,760
high-end live resins and rosin Stu

782
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:48,289
not so much not so much who think

783
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:50,630
whatever we do is gonna have some niche

784
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:52,220
somewhere market immunities no one can

785
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:56,930
ever get tired of having new strains of

786
00:38:52,219 --> 00:39:09,318
cannabis to try just gotta find good

787
00:38:56,929 --> 00:39:11,598
ones and yeah totally exactly a lot of

788
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:14,088
that a lot of people interested in CBD

789
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,890
products or have tried it and are

790
00:39:14,088 --> 00:39:16,730
looking for another accomplice because

791
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:19,068
it's working

792
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:23,869
oh yeah we have a definitely yeah a lot

793
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:27,079
of CBD infused product yeah yeah I'm

794
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:32,990
probably getting into some pure hemp CBD

795
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:35,298
products as well so non cannabis not in

796
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:39,679
the store but focusing on that on an

797
00:39:35,298 --> 00:39:43,509
adjacent building and then started

798
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:46,909
loosing right next exactly I was gonna

799
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:51,528
make it a consumption cafe but I feel

800
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:54,769
like it might be better to just half a

801
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:56,269
CVD product store there instead and do

802
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:57,190
we could do some manufacturing of

803
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,759
products there too

804
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:03,130
[Music]

805
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,600
you know it's because you wouldn't be

806
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,000
able to split the unit cannabis versus

807
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:13,210
non cannabis because it's not split like

808
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:16,929
that yeah I mean consumption on site

809
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:21,480
would be cool but yeah and it's not sure

810
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:21,480
if it's gonna be a lot more to monitor

811
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,889
[Music]

812
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:31,680
it's allowed you can get a permit for a

813
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:31,679
consumption

814
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:38,420
we were going for it and we still are in

815
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,190
the permit process so depending on how

816
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,309
difficult it becomes we might just drop

817
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:45,440
it and go into CVD but we've already

818
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:48,259
paid a pretty good permit fee and it's

819
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:52,250
been five six months now we're just kind

820
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:54,320
of trucking along in the progress not

821
00:40:52,250 --> 00:41:00,610
necessarily ready to outfit it and get

822
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:06,380
all that done so it's no rush not yet

823
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:13,760
not in Humble I don't think so mando

824
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:16,430
definitely I think a lot of I think yeah

825
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,910
that's um so there is one there's one in

826
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:18,649
Mendocino

827
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:21,250
it's the Ingrid lounge is right next to

828
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,250
Allen

829
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:29,059
and it's it's a private sub membership

830
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,039
base kind of situation and honestly I

831
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:32,630
don't really understand or know how the

832
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,369
regulations go as far as conception

833
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:36,608
lodges and let you know I know that

834
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:38,900
they're really working on and tourism

835
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:41,289
I think consumption might be a little

836
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,289
bit of a gray

837
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:52,579
there was

838
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,579
