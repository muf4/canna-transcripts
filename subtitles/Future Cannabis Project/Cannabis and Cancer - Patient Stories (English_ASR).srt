2
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:28,410
in May of 2017 I was diagnosed with

3
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:31,769
uterine cancer stage four B so about as

4
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:41,030
close to the last degree that you would

5
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:44,429
want and I was sent into shock and

6
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:52,698
numbness and fear all at the same time

7
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:55,439
and anger because there was a strong

8
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:58,079
immediate feeling of wait I haven't done

9
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:01,170
everything I want to do in my life I

10
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,210
haven't touched as many people or

11
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,478
experienced as many things as I want to

12
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,420
do I can't have this stopped now I'm not

13
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,000
ready for this to stop now and probably

14
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,290
anybody who's been in my shoes feels the

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,969
same way immediately it's an incredible

16
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:21,200
shock to the system that you may be

17
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:25,728
checking out sooner than you wanted to I

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,710
went in to panic and I also went in to

19
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:33,959
research also at the same time and I

20
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:36,059
started looking for help and I didn't

21
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,009
know where to go aside from I had an

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,070
oncologist at that point saying he

23
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:44,250
wanted me to start my chemo treatment

24
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:49,399
before surgery so that the tumors could

25
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:53,030
be reduced as soon as possible and so I

26
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:57,450
discovered through this wonderful book

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,950
by dr. Kathleen Turner called radical

28
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,780
remissions which was sent to me by a

29
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,299
friend who learned that I had just

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,609
gotten this diagnosis of a woman named

31
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,368
Dale fig-tree who had helped herself

32
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:09,669
cured herself through nutrition after

33
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:11,318
she had been sent

34
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:15,119
you know through chemo and radiation

35
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:17,649
30-plus years ago and she shared stories

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,319
when I reached out to her she's still in

37
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,819
practice in Santa Barbara of her clients

38
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,339
and how well they're doing and one of

39
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:28,149
the things that she recommended I do was

40
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:31,840
check out California providers and get

41
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:34,480
myself doing CBD oil while I'm gonna go

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,729
through treatments and she said it was

43
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,259
well vetted by her and it's the only

44
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:45,429
recommendation that she would make for

45
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:46,899
that type of medicine and so I think all

46
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,969
of us in this position you're

47
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,650
overwhelmed people are coming at you

48
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,359
from all different directions telling

49
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,519
you what they think you should do or you

50
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,209
shouldn't do many of my friends didn't

51
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:01,090
want me to do the chemo my family wanted

52
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:05,530
me to so it got difficult to know what

53
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,780
was the truth for me and having Dale

54
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,090
victory be the first point of reference

55
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,979
that felt like somebody I could relate

56
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:16,060
to and I could trust I just decided to

57
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:18,369
go with that so I also because the

58
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,009
diagnosis happened and then the

59
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:24,489
opportunity to start chemo happened so

60
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:26,828
close to that time there was only three

61
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:29,709
days myself and my family had no time to

62
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:31,810
prepare for what I was about to go

63
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,299
through and everyone was leaving town it

64
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,979
was Memorial Day weekend doctor

65
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:39,099
connection he said somebody needs to be

66
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:41,018
with Hilary observing her because who

67
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:47,680
knows how she'll respond to this chemo

68
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:51,040
treatment and I called you I reached out

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,159
to California providers when I first

70
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:59,250
came home from that first round of

71
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:02,859
treatment and I was in quite a bit of

72
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:07,079
pain but it was a pain unlike any that I

73
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:10,120
had known before it was like my bones

74
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,459
were in pain like a fever that just

75
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,530
wouldn't break and typically they say

76
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,538
that you don't experience that unless

77
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,470
you're given a white blood cell boost

78
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:21,159
shot but I did have pains in my bones

79
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,330
and it

80
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:29,050
was non ceasing pain and so you sent

81
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:32,529
Patrick the cabinet see to be de oil and

82
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:37,650
the cannabis oil shipped it overnight

83
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:40,269
and a friend had given me some cannabis

84
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:41,799
edible cannabis that I took with me for

85
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:45,129
my first round of chemo which really

86
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,900
helped me relax because I was quite

87
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:54,100
anxious as anybody going through this

88
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:55,679
experiences and yet I was so grateful to

89
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,420
be informed that when you're using

90
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,310
products that can come from any number

91
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,920
of places they may not have the same

92
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,899
stringent quality control and there

93
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,689
might be pesticides or residue or

94
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:10,709
petroleum emulsifiers which is also why

95
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:12,519
Dale factory said you were the only

96
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:15,669
reference that she would feel

97
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:18,669
comfortable giving so it felt good to

98
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:21,400
know that I was taking in something that

99
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:27,310
was not aggravating and already toxic

100
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:29,979
overload to my system and it was a lot

101
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,930
to ask of that medicine even to help

102
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:37,390
that first round of chemo was quite

103
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:40,870
strong but I didn't get sick the entire

104
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:43,000
time I was through that first round I

105
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:47,110
had no nausea and I was told I would

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,529
have incredible nausea and I also was

107
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,650
relieved that although nothing sounded

108
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:58,359
appealing I was hungry by 3:00 in the

109
00:05:53,649 --> 00:06:00,939
afternoon each day and needed food I

110
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,069
felt I needed food not intellectually

111
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:06,360
but physically and so I was able to eat

112
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:10,779
the food that people were bringing to me

113
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,780
and I was able to sleep because I was

114
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:15,219
tired from both what I was going through

115
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:17,819
and I think the assistance of the

116
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:22,360
cannabis oil was helping me have sleep

117
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:26,319
so I would also share that right when I

118
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,259
started the treatment my doctor dr.

119
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,089
Godfrey connect me who's an incredible

120
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,339
oncologist was very receptive when I

121
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,008
informed him I'm going to try taking

122
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:36,498
cannabis oil

123
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:39,229
and CBD oil I've been told that it might

124
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:40,759
be beneficial and he said absolutely he

125
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:44,088
left the room and came back with a

126
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:47,479
script for that prescription without

127
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:49,668
hesitation and without judgment he'd

128
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:52,248
said he'd had enough other patients

129
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:54,079
mentioning it to him that he was open to

130
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:57,710
seeing you know if this will help

131
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,688
absolutely try it so having the blessing

132
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,938
of my oncologist for that was very

133
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:07,909
helpful as well so I didn't feel guilty

134
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:11,860
or anxious about counter indicating what

135
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:18,949
I was doing from the Western standpoint

136
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:21,110
and as that first round waned off in its

137
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:30,620
side-effects it took about four or five

138
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:36,528
days I would attribute the CBD oil with

139
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:40,870
helping me also have less fear about

140
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:43,579
this road I was starting on because I

141
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,800
knew I had five more rounds ahead of me

142
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:51,288
I knew that my hair was going to fall

143
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:53,899
out shortly I was unclear how well I

144
00:07:51,288 --> 00:08:00,519
would do through this experience my

145
00:07:53,899 --> 00:08:07,579
prognosis was not great at the time and

146
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:12,139
the level of ease with which I was able

147
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:15,620
to live out those first five days after

148
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:19,069
the first round of treatment surprised

149
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:27,309
me and surprised my friends but I was

150
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:29,838
able to be somewhat released from an

151
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:35,810
overwhelming sense of doom and fear

152
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:40,309
because my anxiety never got sort of the

153
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:42,799
better of me and I was told to take

154
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:46,188
Advil for the pain that was happening in

155
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,689
the bones and I tried to balance that

156
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:50,899
with the advil and the CBD

157
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,670
by day but it didn't touch it and I

158
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:54,679
didn't like the idea of taking the Advil

159
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:59,209
because my liver was already taking such

160
00:08:54,679 --> 00:09:01,189
a hit from the chemotherapy so I started

161
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:04,100
utilizing the cannabis oil which was

162
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,060
specified for evening only during the

163
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,730
day when the symptoms were really acute

164
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:13,909
the higher THC level and it really

165
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,720
helped taking the highest THC level

166
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:19,639
during those four or five days where

167
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,820
you've just come home from your round of

168
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:27,049
chemo as opposed to just taking the CBD

169
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:31,160
oil in the day really helped mitigate

170
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:33,829
the pain and it did intensify the

171
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:38,059
munchies and I was experiencing some

172
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:41,170
symptoms of being high or being stoned

173
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:43,549
as it said in common vernacular and

174
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:46,899
instead of judging that or being anxious

175
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:50,569
about that I allowed myself to just

176
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:53,169
accept it and surrender to it because I

177
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,960
knew that this medicine being natural

178
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:58,490
was going to have no negative side

179
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,080
effects on my body and therefore I

180
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,200
didn't need to be worried about it I

181
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,240
just needed to allow myself to use

182
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,340
whatever I had available to me to help

183
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,830
me get through without tensing my body

184
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,379
as my sister who is a nurse said Hillary

185
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,450
you need to do whatever you can when

186
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:16,610
you're in pain to help ease the pain

187
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:20,840
because otherwise you're adding more

188
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:22,970
cortisol to your system so with the

189
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,629
blessings of even my family and friends

190
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:29,930
I continue to use the medication the

191
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:33,110
cannabis oil and the CBD oil when the

192
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:34,849
intensity of the chemo rounds left by

193
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,070
the end of the first week I had two more

194
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,040
weeks to start rebuilding myself until

195
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,490
the next round and then I was okay to

196
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:46,129
just resume using the CBD oil by day it

197
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,560
really helped with still keeping an

198
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:51,740
appetite because as anyone going through

199
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:53,569
chemo knows you lose your appetite and

200
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:57,289
you become very finicky about what

201
00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:01,089
sounds good and the finicky wasn't

202
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:01,088
really ever able to be

203
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:07,039
overridden it was difficult to know what

204
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,420
I was going to be hungry for in any

205
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,709
given moment and something could sound

206
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:11,689
really good and my friend could bring it

207
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:15,080
to me and then I'd look at it and I

208
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:18,020
think I can't I can't do it but the

209
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,900
hunger was always there and for sure by

210
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:25,009
2:00 in the afternoon thanks to the CBD

211
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:28,730
oil I had a very strong appetite and so

212
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:34,220
I was able to put weight back on within

213
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:35,659
a month I went from 127 down to 117 by

214
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,300
the time I started my first treatment

215
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:40,730
from the way that cancer was taking the

216
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:43,279
muscle tissue and within a month's time

217
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,830
with the CBD oil and the acupuncture and

218
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:50,809
the supplements and the protein powder I

219
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:52,970
was back to 125 126 so feeling my body

220
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:56,629
weight come back and feeling my lack of

221
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:59,029
anxiousness really helped my mindset

222
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:02,299
feel like I actually I'm going to

223
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:07,009
survive this and once I had that thought

224
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:10,490
and I felt my body resoundingly support

225
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:12,110
that thought I think I held on to that

226
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:16,100
and that's what got me through the next

227
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,629
five rounds is just trusting that I am

228
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,490
gonna get through this and that there's

229
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:21,649
something coming from my going through

230
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,529
this that I'm gonna be able to pass

231
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:27,379
forward to others and it's going to open

232
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:30,529
me up to a new life as well so I was

233
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:33,379
taking the the CBD oil not in a tincture

234
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:36,199
during the day but thankfully you sent

235
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:38,350
it to me in capsules already measured so

236
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,360
I didn't have to guess at what I needed

237
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,399
you also sent me the cannabis oil to

238
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,490
take at night in three different

239
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:50,299
gradients of strength to build up slowly

240
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:53,389
and a tincture if I ever needed to add a

241
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:56,059
little bit more so by day I would take

242
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:58,789
the capsule of the CBD oil titled

243
00:12:56,059 --> 00:13:01,969
sunrise which was very helpful sometimes

244
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:04,819
you need it spelled out for you and then

245
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:09,440
just before going to bed I would take

246
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:12,379
the cannabis oil but this was that was

247
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,880
the regiment in the two weeks prior I

248
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:16,789
mean the two weeks

249
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:19,039
after my first round of chemo or second

250
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:21,948
or third or fourth but during the first

251
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,919
week after any round of chemo I was

252
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:28,969
often taking the cannabis oil in the day

253
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:30,860
as well to help with the pain that I

254
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,709
would experience in my bones from the

255
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:38,240
chemo so the CBD oil I would take in the

256
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:40,399
morning started religiously and then I

257
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,089
would take a cannabis oil often in that

258
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:48,078
first week coming home from chemo around

259
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:53,560
12:00 or 1:00 after I'd gotten some food

260
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,559
in my system and yeah yeah

261
00:13:55,629 --> 00:14:06,198
sunrise yes is it 3 2 1 oh hell yes and

262
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:09,379
that prominently a-ok cbda is the first

263
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:12,258
number that's the 3 and the tha is the

264
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:19,669
second number that's the one so they're

265
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:21,800
all cannabis oils okay okay yes yes the

266
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:24,110
second one is anytime which is the

267
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:26,838
tincture right which is a 20 to 100 L

268
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,379
okay then the third one is called relief

269
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:34,339
and that's a 1-2-3 oil so that means

270
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:36,198
that there's one CBD to 3 THC so that's

271
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,850
the nighttime oil so the relief is

272
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,919
generally the nighttime oil even though

273
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,659
you found it effective during the day

274
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,328
time immediately following the

275
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:47,088
chemotherapy right and then you found

276
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:50,679
the three to one oil to be to be

277
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:52,069
effective throughout the course of your

278
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,129
correct

279
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:57,409
I found the three to one oil to be

280
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:59,059
beneficial every day throughout the

281
00:14:57,409 --> 00:15:05,198
chemotherapy throughout the six months

282
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:08,659
and then I found the evening oils the

283
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:11,958
relief oils that I would take before bed

284
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:14,208
to be very beneficial during acute pain

285
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,528
in the daytime which was usually just

286
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:18,318
for about the first four or five days

287
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:20,419
once I was home and then I would just

288
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,229
resume taking the relief oil in the

289
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,909
evenings

290
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,550
starting with twelve point five

291
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:27,409
milligrams through a whole bottle and

292
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:39,049
then graduating up to 20

293
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:42,769
five milligrams I started noticing that

294
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:46,250
I was having much easier time of going

295
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:49,149
through the chemo than others in the

296
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:52,879
infusion rooms when I would show up and

297
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:55,220
I knew that there were multiple prongs

298
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,129
of things that I was doing as I said I

299
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:02,089
was doing nutrition sort of a ketogenic

300
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:04,909
diet more so I was doing intermittent

301
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:08,290
fasting right before my chemo and just

302
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:11,629
drinking vegetable broth during chemo I

303
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:15,429
was doing acupuncture and I was doing

304
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:18,110
the cannabis oil in the CBD oil and I

305
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:21,378
would start to have conversations with

306
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,389
the infusion nurses and they started

307
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:25,759
sharing with me that they were curious

308
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:29,629
because they were seeing how well I was

309
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:32,300
doing and how my body weight looked and

310
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:36,589
how my temperament was and my appetite

311
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:38,448
and I started sharing my experience and

312
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:40,790
what I knew and my resources with some

313
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:43,698
of the other patients on the floor with

314
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:47,328
me who were open to it and receptive to

315
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:51,769
it and many of them didn't know where to

316
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:53,719
go to find cannabis oil or CBD oil and

317
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:55,669
they were intimidated to just go to a

318
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,589
dispensary down the street or friends

319
00:16:55,669 --> 00:17:01,219
would bring them buy things or bake

320
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:05,689
things for them and it felt so good to

321
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:08,838
be able to tell them of a product that

322
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:13,850
was created by a cancer stem cell

323
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:15,828
researcher and where it was absolutely

324
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:18,889
imperative that all of the ingredients

325
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:23,389
were clean that it was emulsified with

326
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:25,788
an organic ingredient and that it was

327
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:29,299
set up from the standpoint of being

328
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:31,579
interviewed by you and learning what my

329
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,710
experience was what my needs were and

330
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:37,398
then getting sort of a customized

331
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,890
treatment that made such sense to me and

332
00:17:37,398 --> 00:17:41,389
it made me feel so good that I wanted

333
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:45,410
everyone who was going through this

334
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:50,750
situation as I was to have that benefit

335
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:53,660
as well and again I felt lucky because

336
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:57,970
my oncologist did not have a stigma or

337
00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:02,029
resistance to me doing this medicine and

338
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:05,089
neither did my family or my friends but

339
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:07,970
I started to get a little bit on my

340
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:09,889
soapbox because other people who thought

341
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,079
it was okay just a smoke wherever they

342
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,930
got something or who were just offered

343
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,849
it I really wanted them to understand

344
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,160
that they might be taking something into

345
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:22,730
their body that may have pesticides or

346
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,460
herbicides on it and that it's more

347
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:29,450
important that they really get access to

348
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:37,970
a safe source of the cabin oyd of the

349
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:55,519
CBD oil you could expect you know some

350
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:57,680
relief from the symptoms the reason that

351
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,960
smoking was not an option for me as the

352
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,970
cancer had metastasized to my lungs and

353
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,120
to my liver and so the idea of putting

354
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:10,759
smoke into my lungs felt completely

355
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:13,669
wrong and I know that it's hard on your

356
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:20,240
lungs regardless if you have tumors in

357
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:22,990
them or not that hot dry smoke so I was

358
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,609
relieved to also be able to have it be

359
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:28,970
edible for that sake you know that I

360
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:30,709
didn't have to smoke it it was only five

361
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,850
or six years ago that a dear friend of

362
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:38,470
mine who went through an ovarian cancer

363
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:41,539
experience didn't have access to safe

364
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:44,360
cannabis and just smoked what her

365
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:46,430
friends brought for her on occasion she

366
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:49,039
felt a lot of relief and the two of us

367
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,808
from the symptoms as you were saying and

368
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,230
she didn't have metastases in

369
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:56,269
her lungs but as far as whether or not

370
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:59,538
it was actually helping mitigate her

371
00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:03,099
cancer or halt the growth or the spread

372
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:05,388
yeah probably not but both of us

373
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:09,798
commiserate in and said I don't know how

374
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:14,599
anybody got through this without the

375
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:19,778
cannabis assistance because it's I think

376
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:27,259
the reason I can safely say that others

377
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:33,069
either fell off their conviction of

378
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:38,749
surviving the treatments or gave up is

379
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:42,678
because it's so hard to be sick to your

380
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:46,850
stomach and feel wretched and lose your

381
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:49,879
hair and lose your muscle and lose your

382
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:55,038
eyelashes and your eyebrows and your

383
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:58,038
confidence and not have a day where that

384
00:20:55,038 --> 00:21:01,460
isn't the case and when you have

385
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:03,528
something like the cannabis oil staving

386
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,139
off the nausea so that you can eat so

387
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:08,359
that your body can stay stronger and

388
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:15,609
you're building muscle again and your

389
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:17,868
feelings of despair are also softly

390
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:20,808
absolved because you're not in a state

391
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:23,028
of fight-or-flight or fear continuously

392
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:26,599
because you're more relaxed as a result

393
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:28,970
of the cannabis oil so you have moments

394
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,339
where you can have perspective and you

395
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,798
can realize you know what I can get

396
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:36,558
through this there are cases of people

397
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:39,859
who survived stage 4 cancer it's not a

398
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:43,940
death sentence any longer and

399
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:45,709
all of those factors are why I feel so

400
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:50,058
strongly about giving this testimonial

401
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:52,130
because my prognosis five years ago

402
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,509
probably would have been we're just

403
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:57,620
gonna try to give you some quality of

404
00:21:53,509 --> 00:22:00,140
life for however long you can get it but

405
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:04,369
both the Western cancer treatments have

406
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:06,410
come so far luckily for me and the

407
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:09,379
integrative approach with Eastern and

408
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:14,029
Western medicines have become more

409
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,690
acceptable that it no longer is a death

410
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:17,889
sentence

411
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:25,039
instead it's maybe a rebirth really and

412
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:27,759
I think that the nutrition the

413
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,700
meditation the acupuncture the

414
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:34,129
supportive oncologist and the cannabis

415
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,600
oil all played a part and why I'm doing

416
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:39,440
as well as I am right now

417
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:43,879
I had a 95 percent response to the chemo

418
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:47,240
in 99 percent shrinkage to the only

419
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,070
tumor that still seems to be seen on my

420
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:55,429
lungs we don't know if it's dead cell or

421
00:22:49,069 --> 00:23:01,189
a tumor marker and my ca-125 markers

422
00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:06,048
last week are down to six and they

423
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,529
started at 232 so I just I'm gonna keep

424
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:09,558
going

425
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:11,990
and I'm gonna keep using the CBD morning

426
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,910
sunrise oil to work on the inflammation

427
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,950
which is happening now as a result of

428
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:19,700
the immune therapy that I've now started

429
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:23,048
and then I'll continue to do the relief

430
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,640
oil in the evenings to try to approach

431
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:29,480
supporting my immune system and halting

432
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,940
the development of the cancer spread if

433
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,140
that's possible so I have started taking

434
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:40,580
immune therapy as my next tier of this

435
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:45,080
regimen and it's a new relatively new in

436
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:49,269
the oncology world medicine that in

437
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:51,889
effect goes in and helps your t-cells

438
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:53,329
register that the cancer cells that they

439
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,330
might be finding

440
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:59,388
in fact cancer cells that need to be

441
00:23:55,329 --> 00:24:01,339
eradicated holds them together like a

442
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:03,678
staple in effect so that your t-cell

443
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:06,499
stays attached long enough to then do

444
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,460
its business and take care of it the

445
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:11,480
side effects which aren't nearly like

446
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,499
chemotherapy you don't lose your hair

447
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,179
you don't have nausea so to the Western

448
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:18,950
medicine world it seems like you don't

449
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:21,379
really have side effects but in in fact

450
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:25,100
I've been experiencing a lot of

451
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:29,058
inflammation and our thrit ik symptoms

452
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:31,579
in my joints and if I compound and go

453
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:34,579
running or stretching too

454
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:37,009
enthusiastically I've actually incurred

455
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:39,739
injury and then the injury is very slow

456
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:42,048
to heal because of the inflammation so

457
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:45,528
the anecdote to the Western world is

458
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:48,308
take a leave or take some oxy coat and

459
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:50,898
when you first experience these symptoms

460
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:54,138
when I herniated my back just recently

461
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:56,689
and the side effects of the immune

462
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:59,748
therapy creating this hyper inflammation

463
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:01,879
in my body it's become very challenging

464
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:04,579
to heal the herniation it's taking

465
00:25:01,878 --> 00:25:07,358
longer and it's painful because of the

466
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:12,308
hyperinflation so I've been utilizing

467
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:17,538
the relief oil by day as opposed to the

468
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:19,428
oxy cotton because the oxy cotton not

469
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:21,349
only did I notice after taking it three

470
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:25,009
nights in a row that I felt worse in the

471
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:26,329
daytime emotionally I also didn't like

472
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:27,769
the idea that I was taking something

473
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:30,949
that I was potentially gonna get

474
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:35,720
physiologically addicted to and I didn't

475
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:37,879
like the sleep that came from it there

476
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,618
were weird dreams and it was a bit

477
00:25:37,878 --> 00:25:42,918
restless once I'd wake up around three

478
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:45,918
or four in the morning so I decided to

479
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:48,710
not use the oxy cotton any longer and I

480
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,139
resumed taking the evening prescription

481
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:54,319
of the cabin oyd cannabis oil

482
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:55,559
the relief by day to help with the pain

483
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,460
and

484
00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:01,359
[Music]

485
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:04,480
and it's helped I'm still having to do

486
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:06,579
the physical therapy to heal up but it

487
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,470
turns out that immune therapy does have

488
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:11,349
side effects it can cause hyper

489
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:17,259
inflammation it can also be hard on your

490
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:20,129
thyroid so I'm gonna need to approach

491
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:23,740
this with nutrition and supplements and

492
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:26,860
the cannabis medicine to help my body

493
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,269
get through this period of time because

494
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:32,439
I will be on the immune therapy

495
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:33,730
potentially for a year could be longer

496
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,910
it's such a new medicine they don't know

497
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,559
how long to put patients on it is one

498
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,590
year enough is two years enough they

499
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,359
just don't know yet so I'm sort of one

500
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:46,000
of the guinea pigs of this new medicine

501
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,500
but it's quite exciting because it

502
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,440
really is allowing your own immune

503
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:54,279
system to go after the cancer cells

504
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:58,450
although unfortunately the side effects

505
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:01,690
of the inflammation are the same issues

506
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,279
that created a comfortable situation for

507
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,910
the cancer to develop in the first place

508
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:09,250
so I'm gonna weigh that out myself with

509
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:13,500
what feels right but again I'm really

510
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:16,720
grateful to be able to have safe access

511
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:21,309
to the cannabis oil to assist me with

512
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,620
the pain safely I don't drive when I'm

513
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:26,980
under the influence of the stronger

514
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:31,239
relief dose in the daytime but when I am

515
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:34,470
taking the sunrise dose I'm very clear

516
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:41,769
I don't feel altered I don't have any

517
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:43,960
side effects of stone enos and as long

518
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:46,089
as I am good about my diet and eating

519
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,340
sort of every couple of hours throughout

520
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:51,429
the day I tend to also be fine without

521
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:53,980
strong case of the munchies by the end

522
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:57,700
of the afternoon but it's really been a

523
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,890
huge help and I want everybody that I

524
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:05,130
know that's going through this to have

525
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:05,130
this same access for the same reasons

526
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:11,169
just as you've gone through this

527
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:16,118
experience incorporating cannabis into

528
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:18,220
your recovery regimen your conversations

529
00:28:16,118 --> 00:28:19,720
with your doctor with other cancer

530
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,028
patients you're meeting when you go to

531
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:28,118
whatever various clinics and facilities

532
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:33,460
you go to with the nurses with my doctor

533
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:37,238
I think he was open but he's quite busy

534
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,759
and he was receptive and respectful but

535
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:42,519
it interestingly enough it was the

536
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,558
fellow working under him who wanted to

537
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:46,839
get the information from me so that she

538
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,249
could pass this on to her patients she

539
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:51,038
had more time to spend with me in the

540
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:54,069
room she asked for the website I gave it

541
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:57,598
to her because she was impressed she

542
00:28:54,069 --> 00:29:00,278
said you know really you're doing

543
00:28:57,598 --> 00:29:03,158
exceptionally well from where you

544
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:06,519
started to where you are now and so I

545
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:08,499
think as a result of how well I have

546
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,378
responded to the chemotherapy and how

547
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:15,608
well I've gotten through this whole six

548
00:29:11,378 --> 00:29:18,579
or seven months more of the nurses also

549
00:29:15,608 --> 00:29:22,388
on the infusion floor are asking me as

550
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:24,339
well what can I share or what what are

551
00:29:22,388 --> 00:29:27,368
some of the things that I know have been

552
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:29,048
beneficial so they too have asked for

553
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:32,949
the information and for the website for

554
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:34,598
the California providers and just this

555
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,278
last week when I was getting my last

556
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:38,589
round of immune therapy one of the

557
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:40,598
nurses on the floor asked if I would be

558
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:42,398
open to speaking to a group of women

559
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:45,158
that collect once a month that are

560
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:47,258
called mothers with cancer down in the

561
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,799
South Bay to share what I've learned and

562
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:57,038
what I'm doing and it makes me realize

563
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:59,048
how specialized this is and how few

564
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,558
people actually do have access to this

565
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:05,138
information and how lucky I feel I am

566
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:08,819
that I received the input from the

567
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:12,488
different people I did along this way so

568
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:15,939
the nurses are impressed and asking

569
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:20,259
questions I think that sea change is

570
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:22,450
happening because my oncologist did ask

571
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:24,460
enough questions about the acupuncturist

572
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,980
which is a little bit more comfortable

573
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,829
probably for him and he is now referring

574
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:32,919
patients to her where is the first

575
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:34,599
several months of going in and espousing

576
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,250
how well I feel like I'm doing as a

577
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,980
result of the cannabis and the

578
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,450
acupuncture he was polite but I don't

579
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,279
think he was impressed and by the end

580
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,480
seeing my results he's now impressed

581
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:46,869
enough that he's starting to make

582
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:50,069
referrals so I think that the proof is

583
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:52,689
always in the pudding and that's why I

584
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:54,460
think more people are asking me and I'm

585
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:59,230
also being more vocal about wanting to

586
00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:05,710
offer information when I see people on

587
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:09,220
the infusion floor and I know intimately

588
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:12,220
what they're going through I know how

589
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:17,200
hard no matter what time of life it is

590
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:21,509
for you no matter what your age how

591
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,490
frightening it alone you can feel so I

592
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:26,079
love being able to approach these people

593
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,429
and ask them if they're interested in

594
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:29,909
learning some of the things that I've

595
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:35,320
learned and if they are then I share

596
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:38,470
with them and every time I've been

597
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:40,839
received with thank you so much you know

598
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,360
I didn't know where to go and Oh

599
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:45,308
somebody had mentioned that I should

600
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:49,359
start taking some of the cannabis and

601
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:52,450
didn't know where to find it I think

602
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:57,599
nine times out of ten any cancer patient

603
00:31:52,450 --> 00:32:01,000
is now become aware that people are

604
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,769
suggesting or mentioning or having

605
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,839
stories of somebody else that's been

606
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:11,019
benefited by using cannabis it's in this

607
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:15,480
particular ilk of people cancer patients

608
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:18,429
I think it's the more common new

609
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,400
conversation in terms of helping you get

610
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:23,530
through it but again it's access to

611
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,390
knowing where to find it for most people

612
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:26,859
they just don't know where to go and the

613
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,720
idea of just going down to a local

614
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:32,369
dispensary is very overwhelming or

615
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:36,000
intimidating or non

616
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:40,649
doable for many reasons probably for

617
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,359
them so it was encouraging to me to see

618
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,850
that my doctor was open-minded to it

619
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,519
that obviously he's heard enough of it

620
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:50,819
now that that's changed how he perceives

621
00:32:47,519 --> 00:33:02,420
it and he was really supportive which

622
00:32:50,819 --> 00:33:02,419
was really encouraging yes where did you

623
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:09,029
sow with the dropper the 20 to 1 boil

624
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:12,150
I've just recently found it to be more

625
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:16,859
useful since going through this

626
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:19,950
herniated back and not wanting to take a

627
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:22,049
leave or ibuprofen to help reduce the

628
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:25,019
pain and the inflammation I've on

629
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:29,819
occasion just given myself small drops

630
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:33,829
under the tongue and in probably 30 40

631
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:36,659
50 minutes or so I start to feel a

632
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:39,509
lightening of the intensity of pain

633
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,960
around the herniated area I'm able to

634
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:45,750
stand up a little bit more upright and

635
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:48,090
work I was able to work on a landscape

636
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,429
designer by trade and I had a job that I

637
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:53,189
had to do and it was painful to drive

638
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:55,230
out to Silver Lake to do the job so I

639
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,630
was just taking the tincture with me and

640
00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:00,058
just dosing myself very lightly very

641
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:02,250
minimally a couple of times a day while

642
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:03,629
I was on the job site and it helped

643
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,849
tremendously I didn't have to take

644
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,650
ibuprofen or Advil which I didn't want

645
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:12,239
to do for my liver because I also had

646
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:16,110
had metastases in my liver and it just

647
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:18,178
gave the slightest bit of relief but I

648
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:21,899
thought was interesting is I didn't ever

649
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,309
feel the high from it I just felt the

650
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:26,819
pain relief probably because I was

651
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:28,980
taking such a little amount I'm not I'm

652
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:39,330
not quite sure but it worked so it just

653
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:41,579
became my pain management okay so it

654
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:44,069
really was helping that yeah so the

655
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,489
level that was in the tincture really

656
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,720
was helping with the inflammation of it

657
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:49,539
because it really helps with the pain

658
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,939
and that's that's a common response that

659
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:53,889
we especially with back thing we have a

660
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,110
lot of patients who respond really well

661
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:59,890
over 21 cancer from from back pain oh

662
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:01,329
great yeah as well as the 1 2 3 formula

663
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:03,309
the relief for me whether they take at

664
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:08,920
night because they can sleep through the

665
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:11,650
night that's exactly right that's

666
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,690
exactly right frequently not taking

667
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,730
anything during the day right

668
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:18,970
as far as cannabis except for that

669
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:21,969
nighttime dose so your responses is not

670
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:23,799
unusual that's great yeah I I would say

671
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:26,769
one thing that I would suggest to

672
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,289
anybody using the cannabis oil and the

673
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:33,940
CBD oil is I became aware that I needed

674
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:37,210
to increase my fee Lewis I could feel

675
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:40,240
somewhat dehydrated in the morning after

676
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:42,369
taking the relief oil at night and that

677
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:45,099
ended up being a benefit anyway because

678
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:46,300
you want to be taking in a lot more

679
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:48,279
fluids when you've gone through

680
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,519
chemotherapy to help flush out those

681
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,560
toxins so if you're just good about

682
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,019
drinking some water for singing in the

683
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:59,108
morning a cup of warm water with lemon

684
00:35:56,019 --> 00:36:01,090
or just some water by your bed and then

685
00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:05,170
drinking more water than normally

686
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:07,630
throughout the day that really adds to

687
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:10,059
the benefit of all of it it wouldn't be

688
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,670
just one tool that will help me heal

689
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:16,358
from the cancer and luckily in Los

690
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:18,369
Angeles and I hope broader there are

691
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:20,259
integrative approaches that are becoming

692
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:22,840
more and more available and more common

693
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:26,290
and so I knew that I would need

694
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:28,420
nutrition from the assistance I got from

695
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:30,909
a nutritionist that I consulted with I

696
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:33,579
knew I would need the supplements and

697
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:36,549
the acupuncture I knew I would need the

698
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:39,699
CBD oil and the cannabis oil and I knew

699
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:42,820
I would need the chemo and all of them

700
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:46,858
together and the meditation and the

701
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:49,539
clean water played a part in me

702
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:51,880
realigning myself and my life and

703
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:56,380
healing my body letting my body heal

704
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:58,190
from the inside out yeah

705
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,170
so I don't think

706
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:03,289
I don't think we can succeed in getting

707
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:05,420
ourselves well again from something by

708
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:07,610
using just one tool in the toolbox

709
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:12,440
because it wasn't just one thing that

710
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:15,470
got us that SiC and the more that we can

711
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:19,340
start to understand that the eastern and

712
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:24,349
the Western are here for a reason and

713
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:26,990
that together those two fields are what

714
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:28,150
will give the optimum holistic approach

715
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:35,029
to healing

716
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:45,789
so nothing yeah nothing can do it all by

717
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:45,790
itself frequently because they've

718
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:54,949
experienced agree yes and then they're

719
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:57,440
fearful of it right but there's a

720
00:37:54,949 --> 00:38:00,049
ramping up or a titrating of the dose

721
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,840
that helps you to reach a maximum

722
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:06,410
tolerated dose that if it's done

723
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,910
correctly you don't really experience

724
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,039
what what some people would consider an

725
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:11,989
overdose of cannabis but yeah lethal

726
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:15,889
overdose by any means it's just you're

727
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:19,819
you're it's more than you're mentally

728
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:22,009
capable of handling at that point in

729
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,840
your in your life okay so and this is

730
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,730
great this is another this is probably

731
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,280
one of the primary reasons why I was

732
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:31,519
such a fan of you and what you guys are

733
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,910
creating because when I was given some

734
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,710
cannabis oil edible from a friend for my

735
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:41,149
first round of treatment it was from

736
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:44,260
some dispensary in Venice and it was ten

737
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:49,300
point something milligrams I think and

738
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:53,810
not being used to eating that much oil

739
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,560
cannabis oil I was unprepared for how

740
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:58,190
strong it was

741
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:00,829
I had experienced being stoned earlier

742
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,360
in my life so I wasn't afraid but that's

743
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:05,389
a really good point that anyone who

744
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,829
hasn't experienced being I it could be

745
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:09,469
intimidating if they would just went

746
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:11,808
straight into it without gradually

747
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:15,328
building up a tolerance

748
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:18,298
once I spoke with you and you sent the

749
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:21,809
capsules in there gradated you know

750
00:39:18,298 --> 00:39:26,038
gradually from 12.5 to 25 to 50

751
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:28,680
milligrams I was surprised it took about

752
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:32,519
three or four days for me to get used to

753
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:34,169
the 12.5 in the evening because I was

754
00:39:32,518 --> 00:39:35,338
also taking it a little bit earlier on

755
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:38,159
in the evening because I was still

756
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:39,989
wanting to deal with the pain and you

757
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,558
were absolutely right by the time I was

758
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:43,940
done

759
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:47,359
midway through the bottle of the 12.5

760
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:50,309
there was no problem I wasn't

761
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:52,798
experiencing heavy duty I was sleeping I

762
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:54,900
was waking up rested I was not having

763
00:39:52,798 --> 00:39:58,588
the pain in the same way during those

764
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:01,349
weeks so I I don't know if I'm answering

765
00:39:58,588 --> 00:40:05,308
the question appropriately but i I've

766
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:08,519
strongly encouraged people to call you

767
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:10,170
because when other people have told me

768
00:40:08,518 --> 00:40:12,118
about having to go to a dispensary and

769
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,009
guess what the amount is that they'll

770
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,619
need or when they've tried to figure out

771
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:19,710
if they're doing it in drops how many

772
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:22,200
drops they need and they can over dose

773
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:24,509
themselves it can be especially if

774
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:26,368
you're older and this is not a common

775
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:27,659
experience for you it could be super

776
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:29,789
intimidating and you might just snore

777
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:32,399
the baby out with the bathwater so

778
00:40:29,789 --> 00:40:35,190
having it come already in gelatin

779
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,579
capsules measured out with the right

780
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:41,489
time to take it because midway through

781
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:43,979
chemotherapy you really need it to be as

782
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:45,509
simple as possible having it say sunrise

783
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:47,699
and having it say evening was very

784
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:49,289
helpful when you're fumbling around for

785
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:55,978
bottles in the middle of the day or in

786
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:58,559
the evening and yes I think that I think

787
00:40:55,978 --> 00:41:00,478
most people have experienced an altered

788
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,400
state to one degree or another whether

789
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:04,318
it was through alcohol you know they all

790
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,940
maybe knew what it was to have too many

791
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:09,599
beers when they were in high school or

792
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:11,429
college or too many margaritas or maybe

793
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,969
they know what it's like to have taken

794
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:16,768
some other type of recreational drug and

795
00:41:13,969 --> 00:41:19,798
I think one of the things that's unique

796
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:22,949
to people going through cancer is you're

797
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:24,480
already in such a state of surrender

798
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:27,299
when you're going through chemotherapy

799
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,440
treatment by virtue of you have to your

800
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,630
life is on the line

801
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,900
you're willing to do whatever it takes

802
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:37,588
including taking incredibly toxic drugs

803
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:40,108
into your system intravenously with the

804
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:42,960
hopes that this is going to save you so

805
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:44,719
you're a lot more receptive to trying

806
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,769
things that you would not have

807
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,269
previously I believe when you're going

808
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:51,989
through something where you're fighting

809
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:56,579
for your life and the more you can just

810
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:58,049
be in surrender and and the ease you

811
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,329
feel of taking something that you know

812
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:02,490
is natural and for a change is not

813
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:07,619
harmful to your body into your body to

814
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:09,269
help it's a huge relief and so some of

815
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:12,269
the side effects if you're feeling some

816
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:15,030
of the stone enos actually can come as

817
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:19,019
quite a relief as well because it can

818
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:20,519
help you relax and as I found it also

819
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:21,989
helped me have more of a perspective

820
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:24,539
about what I was going through I

821
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:29,149
actually had moments where I got so

822
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:32,190
quiet and so meditative and so

823
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:36,119
appreciative of the natural world around

824
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:38,099
me again cancer can give you a timeout

825
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:41,608
button from your life and it can help

826
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:43,769
you read introduce yourself to what it

827
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:46,619
is about living that you knew as a child

828
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:48,358
that you'd forgotten and you feel more

829
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:52,380
inclined when you're under the influence

830
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:54,838
I felt of the CBD oil by day or the

831
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:58,460
relief oil by day if I needed it to be

832
00:42:54,838 --> 00:43:01,380
outside which I also think is a hugely

833
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:04,679
therapeutic part of healing for anybody

834
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,960
is to be in nature you end up finding

835
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:10,588
that you feel more drawn to the things

836
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,050
that are more natural to you by virtue

837
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:15,119
of the experience of slowing down and

838
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:18,269
being relaxed and being open minded

839
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:22,789
which the CBD oil seems to be conducive

840
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:26,608
towards so any of the anxiety about

841
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:28,800
being out of control or not feeling in

842
00:43:26,608 --> 00:43:31,348
control that a lot of people experience

843
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:35,660
if they get too much of anything that

844
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:37,910
alters them is mitigated by you creating

845
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:39,829
the capsules according to who they are

846
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:41,839
and what they need in such a way that

847
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:43,639
they just no I just need to take that

848
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:46,760
one capsule that says sunrise in the

849
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:49,879
morning and one in the evening and I'll

850
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:53,540
gradually work my way up but I won't

851
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,829
ever be out of control it's really

852
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:57,469
helpful and it's helpful to know that

853
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:59,420
you can be called that I was able to

854
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:02,029
call either of you at any time if I

855
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:06,260
needed to to ask questions was also

856
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:08,030
tremendous comfort because there's a lot

857
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,500
of questions sometimes that come up in

858
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,970
your mind about what you're doing and

859
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,039
what might work and what might not work

860
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:15,199
and to have somebody on the other end of

861
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:16,909
the phone who's kind and thoughtful and

862
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:23,489
receptive

863
00:44:16,909 --> 00:44:23,489
