1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,890
so they just gave you this topic and

2
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:14,739
said this is what you're gonna talk

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,510
about so I spent some time really

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,309
locking it down what does that mean what

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,250
is open source how does it apply what

6
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:22,839
we're doing are we really open source I

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:28,719
can't tell but that's what we're gonna

8
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:31,050
call it so the check check check check

9
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:39,189
check check

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:40,149
never check check check check check

11
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:43,269
check check

12
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:46,140
all right I'll try again there was never

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:50,559
a war on drugs it's always been a war on

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,189
people on the little guy this war did

15
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,189
via

16
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:09,000
yeah good point so took the government a

17
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,159
whole long time but we the people the

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,709
non-centralized offensive guerrilla

19
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:20,759
force have the ability to change at a

20
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:23,159
moment's notice point point made because

21
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,290
this time the people have a tool more

22
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,929
powerful than any government corporation

23
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,270
this time we have the ability to freely

24
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,640
communicate at a global scale

25
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:34,640
this time we have the open source model

26
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,460
[Music]

27
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,990
[Applause]

28
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:42,750
don't take my word for it though let's

29
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:45,629
take a look at Microsoft circa 1990s and

30
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,149
early 21st century executives at

31
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:50,030
Microsoft were terrified of Linux and

32
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,409
the open source model for good reason

33
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,570
they claimed that it was a cancer to

34
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,879
their business internal memos at the

35
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,859
company acknowledged open-source as a

36
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,049
methodology capable of meeting or

37
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,700
exceeding proprietary development

38
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,379
methodology so basically their entire

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,978
system that they built this company on

40
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,849
was that threat of losing to this wild

41
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:09,899
open-source thing that they couldn't

42
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,489
even put a pin on there's

43
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,289
non-centralized didn't know who was

44
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,219
running it how do we stop this

45
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:19,139
Ballmer called this new threat communism

46
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:21,479
Microsoft developed intricate proprietor

47
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,958
intricate strategies to lock customers

48
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:29,569
into proprietary software embrace extend

49
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,569
extinguish was their model conquer all

50
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,409
flash forward 20 years Linux is the

51
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,719
backbone of the internet and most of

52
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:39,479
your smartphones Microsoft still makes

53
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,189
plenty of money and not only owns but is

54
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,328
the number one contributor to github one

55
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:44,810
of the largest communities of

56
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:46,620
open-source software on earth and

57
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,479
nobody's living in communes

58
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,950
unfortunately that's a different that's

59
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,090
a different speech so what happened

60
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:56,250
Microsoft realized that they couldn't

61
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,590
compete with shared development the

62
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,810
flexibility and capability of a global

63
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,420
network of contributors far outpaced

64
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,939
their ability to keep up when they

65
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,530
accepted this they also switched a good

66
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,019
portion of their business model to Mir

67
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,750
this more successful model Microsoft now

68
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,120
makes

69
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,310
more money on Linux based cloud services

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:22,629
than they do on proprietaries Windows

71
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:24,909
software adapter dies at work but that's

72
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:27,549
software not cannabis processing

73
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:30,459
formulation or science so what does

74
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:34,780
open-source actually mean to us let me

75
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:36,340
tell you about skunk farm so once upon a

76
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,709
time I was just a guy in the garage

77
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,959
doing my black market thing trying to

78
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,520
figure out how to extract cannabis oil

79
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,800
without killing myself like all the

80
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,510
people on the news we had one of my

81
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,120
friends had a really successful edible

82
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:51,549
company in Washington captain cosmics in

83
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,289
the good old medical days yeah there's

84
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,840
the good stuff these brownies holy cow

85
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:57,189
2000 milligram brownie and that was like

86
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,719
a we were just guessing we weren't even

87
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,979
testing everything it's probably about

88
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:05,080
2000 based on last time they were strong

89
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:06,579
but we needed to refine our extraction

90
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,200
method and he put me in charge of

91
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,890
figuring out what does that mean how do

92
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,199
we do that

93
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:12,969
so as anybody at the time could to tell

94
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,780
you you you search anything extraction

95
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:16,149
on the internet you're gonna come across

96
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,709
skunk farm so I scoured skunk form I

97
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,089
spent you know I've got this weird thing

98
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,100
that's where the data dump came from

99
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,539
where if I get on to a track I'm just in

100
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,150
a wormhole for a long time

101
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,460
so I spent weeks refining my craft based

102
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:30,699
on skunk farm use that to build that

103
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:33,279
company into something great move ahead

104
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,659
a couple years and I've bought land out

105
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,789
in the middle of the woods to be my

106
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,560
bug-out I'm done with society I've gone

107
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,700
off the deep end on conspiracy theories

108
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,168
and I realized that there's no point

109
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,939
thinking about them so I'm just gonna go

110
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:44,228
and find my own personal liberty I'm

111
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:46,418
gonna grow food and I'm just gonna be

112
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:48,699
done with it all six months later this

113
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:51,159
little bumfuck town i moved to is where

114
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:53,680
the first 15 licenses in the legal

115
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,729
marketing kit in washington come and my

116
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,259
partner and i looked at he tried to say

117
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,120
hey here's a sign we should get into

118
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:01,478
this so I become the general manager of

119
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,069
a shop and I get positioned to set up

120
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:05,189
the lab of which I know nothing about

121
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:08,259
again this is this is a little while ago

122
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:10,810
the first thing I do is go to skunk farm

123
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:12,370
and find how to contact them and I give

124
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,019
them a call and I said hey would you

125
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,790
guys do consultation can you come set up

126
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:17,469
a lab and they said surely we cost a

127
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,360
whole bunch of money but if you really

128
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,560
need us to hold your hand we'll come and

129
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,270
do it right there is like one of my

130
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,490
major pivoting points by the way is like

131
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:27,109
oh okay if you give away the information

132
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,918
people are willing to pay you whatever

133
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,810
because you're the guy so they ended up

134
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:34,579
poaching me out of that position and I

135
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,439
go start working for gray wolf and I

136
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:38,300
wasn't big on icy mags so I wasn't

137
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:40,730
really sure who it was it was Joe that

138
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,370
poached me and I end up working directly

139
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,050
under the old grumpy bastard for 18

140
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,389
months and I learned more than you could

141
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,770
ever imagine and one of the most

142
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,569
important things I learned from him is

143
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:52,310
all of this information that he'd been

144
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:54,349
sharing for free all of this how to

145
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,060
build extractors how to do all of these

146
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,950
things safely and effectively

147
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,780
he had also started a business selling

148
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,459
those exact things he was giving out and

149
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:03,319
so that was another pivotal point for me

150
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:05,269
was okay how is it that this guy's

151
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,009
giving out everything for free and it's

152
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:08,990
not only getting paid to be this source

153
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:10,069
of knowledge when when people need their

154
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,780
handheld but he's also started a

155
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,029
business selling the things that he just

156
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:15,559
told you exactly how to make piece by

157
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:17,329
piece where to buy the parts everything

158
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,370
because people will pay for the

159
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:21,500
convenience and that's kind of a you

160
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,209
know a core model here where you can

161
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,470
give everything out for free and still

162
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,269
make a lot of money because people

163
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,520
always pay for the convenience like the

164
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:30,829
open source Linux platform and Microsoft

165
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:32,149
great example they still put in the work

166
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:33,199
and their customers still pay them

167
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:34,788
because the customer is not going to go

168
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,800
out and build their own Linux based web

169
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:42,949
server that runs on on Windows it's

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,930
crazy that I work for skunk farm under

171
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,939
farm gold they have their own issues

172
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,439
I left that because of management

173
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,930
disagreements and the way that the skunk

174
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:53,509
farmers were getting treated but from

175
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,728
that I had I took those lessons and

176
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,409
that's when we got into pesticide

177
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:59,149
remediation I started looking an error

178
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,770
in listening really to what are the

179
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:02,179
problems and as I was coming down to

180
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:04,219
California for work I started seeing

181
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,840
more and more people with stockpiles of

182
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,130
distillate I started asking alarum why

183
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,629
do you guys have so much distillate

184
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:09,949
everywhere and I said oh because there's

185
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,509
poison in it and now we can't sell

186
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,339
poison anymore it's full of my club you

187
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:15,199
know I said oh wow there's you got a

188
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:17,299
million dollars worth of micro butanol

189
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,319
distillate right here I bet if I figured

190
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,060
out a way to get that out you'd probably

191
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,579
pay me a decent amount of money to turn

192
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,769
unusable product and usable product so I

193
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:27,259
partnered up with nug farms in Photon

194
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:28,829
and got a little bit of help from some

195
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:31,110
other people and we

196
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:33,060
put that into trials and discovered

197
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,590
pesticide remediation through you know

198
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,750
what is novel to cannabis but what is

199
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:39,089
really elementary chemistry and and I'm

200
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,560
not a chemist so you know I was walk

201
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:43,289
through what is chromatography how does

202
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,879
that work but what I retained through

203
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,760
all of that was the IP to the entire

204
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,509
tech and in I went through this little

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,750
moral dilemma

206
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:53,969
do I keep this tech to myself and sell

207
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,699
it if I do how long till someone just

208
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,320
bootlegs it and gets rid of it maybe I

209
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:01,409
should just release it out because

210
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,319
really the goal my goal always has been

211
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,300
can how do we get people more high for

212
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,620
cheaper safer with better product right

213
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,800
so those are kind of like core tenets

214
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,780
and so we I released the pesticide

215
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,150
remediation wrote up an SOP some little

216
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:18,359
half-assed scientific journal entry and

217
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:20,609
let it out and that was really when the

218
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,150
flood wave came that was the that was my

219
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:26,400
first interaction with the open sourcing

220
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:28,289
of information based on you know these

221
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,689
lessons I had learned and it worked to a

222
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,890
tee my social media following exploded

223
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:33,659
all of a sudden I was getting calls left

224
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:35,069
and right even though I had given out

225
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,750
all this information completely for free

226
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,830
the people with the money they didn't

227
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,120
care they wanted their hands held

228
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,430
they're willing to pay whatever it was

229
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,570
that I would charge to come down and do

230
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:44,519
it for them

231
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,230
so we took that model and applied at the

232
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,899
ethanol extraction falling film

233
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,550
evaporators and this all culminated in

234
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:56,759
the form that Travis had mentioned

235
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:58,589
earlier so future 4200 calm as anybody

236
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:02,220
in the room not never heard of future

237
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:06,500
4200 calm maybe no don't want to say

238
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,500
okay I don't believe you but all right

239
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,899
the forum has become really the number

240
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,789
one place on earth for the open

241
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,639
communication of ideas revolving around

242
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:17,679
cannabis processing a platform for

243
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,439
people to present refine ideas with

244
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,449
their peers a symbol of how an open

245
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,730
source of data can thrive and empower

246
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,000
its contributors several industry

247
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,029
changing revolutions have occurred there

248
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,490
the first big one in my eyes is the O

249
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:35,620
TSS crystallization so in the early days

250
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,299
of the forum I get hit up by a guy he

251
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,129
had identified all these models that I

252
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:40,389
just told you which as a permaculturist

253
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:42,279
I love because it's all about

254
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:43,960
identifying successful natural patterns

255
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,879
and repeating them so out of the blue

256
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,290
this guy says hey we're making these

257
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,090
diamonds that all these big companies

258
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:51,009
are making and I'll I'll tell you

259
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,899
exactly how to do it if you if you'll

260
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:54,159
put it up on your forum and give me the

261
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,730
credit for being the guy that told you

262
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:59,469
how to do it so he sends me like a 2,000

263
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,629
word run-on sentence and says here's the

264
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,420
SOP and I said oh my goodness

265
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:06,370
this is okay so we spend like a week

266
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,289
refining it and we let this out giving

267
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,639
him full credit not the other first

268
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:13,509
group of every told that I proof read

269
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:15,399
that wrong sentence and man did it work

270
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:17,799
thus it the model repeated itself

271
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,809
beautifully here it is here's the

272
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,729
information for free 90% of the people

273
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:23,289
went grab the information went home and

274
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,899
made diamonds on their own but that 10%

275
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:30,959
that wanted to have their hands held may

276
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:35,470
Bob a rich man on his free information

277
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:38,110
Travis the next really big one and this

278
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:41,139
one is huge this one is one of my

279
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,450
favorites color remediation cartridges

280
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:45,990
again novel to the cannabis industry

281
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,390
some really basic basic chemistry

282
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,610
chromatography using a different solvent

283
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:53,230
nothing crazy there but nobody I guess

284
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,789
people had been applying it nobody was

285
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,289
talking about it that was the big thing

286
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:57,730
and the same with the Diamonds he didn't

287
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,349
invent the diamond tech' he was just the

288
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,399
first guy to tell you how to do it and

289
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:06,040
same with this so a combination of endo

290
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,939
fabs and dread pirate now we get a lot

291
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,659
of input from

292
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,100
Marie and we're watching this this time

293
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:13,179
it's much bigger last time Bob was

294
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,399
really the only one that came out of

295
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:17,199
that as a paid man now we're seeing

296
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,629
companies formed out of open source

297
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,730
technologies multiple people have formed

298
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:24,100
very lucrative consulting businesses

299
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,230
they're teaching classes because people

300
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:33,420
are willing to pay for this open source

301
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:37,000
knowledge but this is bigger than

302
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:38,889
cannabis yeah this is like a holistic

303
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,440
thing that we're facing right now and

304
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:43,600
it's kind of getting back into what the

305
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,710
the host of this venue it we're talking

306
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,170
about before I got up here is this open

307
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,030
source model is a community thing this

308
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:53,769
this is forcing us to interact with each

309
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:56,139
other which is really the true nature of

310
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:57,819
being a human and I'm a capitalist to

311
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:59,710
the core but I believe that we need a

312
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,690
cycle capitalism I bit I believe that we

313
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,610
need permaculture based capitalism your

314
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,110
capitalism has to be based on taking

315
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,000
care of the earth and taking care of

316
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,100
people first and I trust me if you do

317
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,710
that you're gonna be more successful so

318
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,690
more importantly than the creativity and

319
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,330
innovation open-source thinking can

320
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,150
inspire is the defense against a closed

321
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,570
system when we allow closed systems to

322
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:24,129
rule the world we give away our freedom

323
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:27,220
inevitably closed systems control

324
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:29,740
information and data and with data you

325
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,600
can control people with the money you

326
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,940
can derive from this data you can

327
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,250
control the government when one company

328
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:39,400
controls both the people and the

329
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,259
government we have serious issues closed

330
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,329
systems allow power to consolidate

331
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:45,309
closed systems are why the majority of

332
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,950
existing cannabis patents are currently

333
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:49,779
held by a few large companies companies

334
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,940
that don't give a fuck about the plant

335
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:54,220
or you or any of the things that we've

336
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,570
built over the last 70 years of

337
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,670
prohibition patents that were acquired

338
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,589
during the depths of that prohibition

339
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:04,360
for the long-play before any of us were

340
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:06,370
even thinking about before a lot of us

341
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,450
were born but before any of us were even

342
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,039
thinking that this is going to be

343
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,480
something legal that we might build

344
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,819
businesses and put our whole entire

345
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,149
lives into these companies were solid

346
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,150
aiding power

347
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,110
they acquired these patents knowing that

348
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,110
it would be nice to control that as well

349
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,278
so I don't suggest to have the answer to

350
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,750
the serious problems that face the

351
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,028
cannabis equipment manufacturer

352
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,110
regarding open source same way I

353
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:33,610
couldn't have answered the music

354
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,159
industry's problem with Napster at the

355
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,570
turn of the century I do know that

356
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,179
Chinese companies are going to steal

357
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,770
your ideas replicate them ship them back

358
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:42,250
to the US for cheaper than you can

359
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:44,528
imagine

360
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,839
regardless of what model you take sure

361
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:47,919
you can fight the Chinese maybe even

362
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,260
leverage the government to shut down

363
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,088
trade with them not that any of the

364
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:53,860
other multi-billion dollar industries

365
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:56,350
have had any luck with that approach but

366
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,200
good luck but just like shutting down

367
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:01,450
Napster led to Kazaa LimeWire and much

368
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,950
worse torrents fighting the theft of

369
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,360
intellectual property in the 21st

370
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,240
century feels like a short-sighted

371
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,820
approach perhaps if we focus on the

372
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,320
things that we can control things we can

373
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,450
leverage through the same internet

374
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,700
channels that seem to be leading to our

375
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,480
destruction we can tap into what people

376
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,220
really desire corporate trust

377
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,620
transparency and personal relationships

378
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,750
with customers things no foreign company

379
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,019
can provide but building community

380
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,600
within we can all level up together see

381
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:33,220
that's the real solution here the only

382
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,589
way to protect the plant and our

383
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,470
economic futures involving said plant is

384
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:40,390
to work together open-source is probably

385
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,070
the wrong term for this idea but the

386
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:43,720
point is that we need to open up to each

387
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,000
other to build a better future for

388
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,830
cannabis professionals for the canvas

389
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,999
plant and for society as a whole

390
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,999

392
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:04,188
thank you Thank You Dustin we're gonna

393
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:06,379
take a couple quick questions if anyone

394
00:15:04,188 --> 00:15:08,539
wants a show of hands but is a question

395
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:10,490
for Dustin you know this you're getting

396
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:15,588
a free question usually it cost you a

397
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:21,948
truckload of money anybody in the back

398
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:25,309
there no and I never will I'm not a I

399
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:27,740
don't sell equipment he asked are you

400
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:28,429
are you selling CRC tech er or the

401
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,778
equipment

402
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,578
I'll sell you the tech if you need your

403
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:34,698
handheld but no the equipment there's

404
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:35,808
multiple industry or manufacturers in

405
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:38,808
the industry right now that are selling

406
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:40,778
that MBO ler endo fabs busy will

407
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:42,649
probably jangle you something together

408
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:44,299
really any of the stainless

409
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:46,429
manufacturers can put you together a

410
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:49,609
cartridge I think open-source steel is

411
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:52,429
still around I also think glacier tanks

412
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,199
is probably still around killa on the

413
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:56,808
forum is will put you together one

414
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:59,688
really cheap if you if you want China

415
00:15:56,808 --> 00:16:00,980
parts I'm really gonna probably be

416
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:03,379
getting China parks wherever you go of

417
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,519
