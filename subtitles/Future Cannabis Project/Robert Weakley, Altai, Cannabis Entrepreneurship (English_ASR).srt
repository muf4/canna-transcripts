1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,710
the co founder CEO president of alt

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,960
Indus Holdings that is an IP company

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,990
that actually holds the IP for Dixie

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,820
California along with Iran all ty based

5
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:22,709
in Monterey California Salinas Valley

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,689
you know we started looking at this

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,420
about two years ago really hardcore

8
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,060
about a year ago we got into this to

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,429
create a brand an edible brand on the

10
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,600
market that can be trusted that was

11
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:38,939
about transparency low-dose

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,829
single-serving and and really have a

13
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,869
product that everybody knew when you had

14
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,739
this product that you'd have the same

15
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:48,599
experience time after time we met Dixie

16
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:49,828
kind of in the research as we were

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,620
looking at all tie and how we are

18
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:57,359
launching our own brand trip and Chuck

19
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:59,339
and I met in in Las Vegas actually with

20
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,530
a business partner of mine had met trip

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,930
before introduced us and we just hit it

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,909
off we were so like-minded in the way

23
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,609
that we want to look to continue to

24
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,430
elevate this industry and to continue to

25
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:13,739
bring legitimacy and transparency and

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,210
safety to this industry and so that's

27
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,309
kind of where the conversation started

28
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:19,739
with Dixie probably about six nine

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,629
months after we started down the road

30
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,658
with all Thai and we ended up launching

31
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:27,170
both brands at the same time both Dixie

32
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,909
and all tie and it was a great synergy

33
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,950
Dixie's been in the industry for five

34
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,430
years they've gone through a lot of the

35
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,859
ups and downs the different regulations

36
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:40,200
and in Colorado they have the ability to

37
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,780
have science on property and in their

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,130
science department is unbelievable to

39
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,140
where we were able to benefit from that

40
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,908
we're in California we can't really get

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,500
into the extraction process and some of

42
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,270
that science where we had that

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,920
experience with them and then my

44
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:55,048
business partner Mark Ainsworth two

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,149
heads because you're not we're not

46
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,399
allowed to correct extraction is still

47
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,340
an issue here in California and so

48
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,409
having the plant materials legal having

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,930
the oil is legal the process of making

50
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,300
it from plant material into the oil is

51
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,580
still considered illegal here in

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,689
California now with 266 that's changing

53
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,890
and they'll actually be

54
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:18,740
an area there that's written into the

55
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:20,299
bill that that highlights extraction and

56
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,200
perm and you can actually get a permit

57
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,969
for either in volatile or volatile

58
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,709
extraction processes but so that's

59
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:30,229
really kind of where where the things

60
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:33,290
came through mark Ainsworth use my other

61
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:35,989
business partner works for he had his

62
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:37,849
own manufacturing facility where he

63
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,320
produced for Whole Foods nationally for

64
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,269
the last eight years he was a pastry

65
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,039
chef for ritz-carlton for eight years so

66
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,290
we understood understood food science

67
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,729
and quality and shelf life and that's

68
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:48,500
where you know really got us excited

69
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:51,500
about coming into this industry also is

70
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,669
that a lot of the the products out there

71
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,020
were people that were in the cannabis

72
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:56,149
industry that maybe didn't have any

73
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,580
experience in in actual food

74
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,520
manufacturing and understanding food

75
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,900
science and shelf life and safety

76
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,370
mechanisms to where you know we had all

77
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,980
of that and we use cannabis as an

78
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,330
ingredient in our products so oil is the

79
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,549
cannabis oil is just another ingredient

80
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,620
so we look to create a product that

81
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,830
could stand up on Whole Foods or in any

82
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,569
gourmet shop on its own and then look to

83
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,709
infuse the oil to make sure that we have

84
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,269
the medicine for the people here in

85
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,580
California there's no reason medicine

86
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,500
needs to taste bad you know we we looked

87
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,810
at really going into the low dose of 10

88
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,110
milligrams and 25 milligrams are the

89
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,270
only two serving sizes that we have our

90
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,980
belief is that that's where the where

91
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:37,040
the market is going to go he wants to

92
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:39,139
take a 500 milligram cookie and break it

93
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,239
into 10 pieces and have guessed work of

94
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:42,769
how much am i having what is you know

95
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,239
last time I you know I had a good

96
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,980
experience this time I gonna have a bad

97
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,689
experience what how much medication am I

98
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:50,060
really getting all of our stuff is

99
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:52,159
triple tested so when we tell you it's

100
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,900
ten milligrams or 25 milligrams it's

101
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,500
really 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams of

102
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,719
active THC and so we feel that's really

103
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,150
the future on a lot of things as as you

104
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,639
look at California Colorado and their

105
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:07,219
regulations it's all now it has to be 10

106
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,969
milligrams serving size maximum of 100

107
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:12,349
milligrams proportion or per container

108
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:15,139
you know it really leads to making sure

109
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,600
with the safety aspect and as people get

110
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:19,310
into it to understand you know when you

111
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,410
talk to a lot of people these days they

112
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,538
talk about how edibles they're excited

113
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,790
they like it but they're still unsure on

114
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:27,490
how to actually

115
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,920
medicate with edibles what is the

116
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,290
appropriate dose how am i how do I know

117
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,730
and there's really a lack of education

118
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,560
out there on some of this and that's

119
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,080
what we're really trying to push is the

120
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,329
education level that consistency level

121
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,430
that people can really understand and

122
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:44,259
and know what to expect every single day

123
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,079
every single time they have it as we

124
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:49,509
looked into licensing a product here

125
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,550
into California like Dixie you know it

126
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:53,649
was it was one of those opportunities to

127
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,910
as we jumped into this market to have

128
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:57,310
somebody that had a lot more experience

129
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,590
than us and knowledge into things and

130
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,389
and to be able to benefit from that so

131
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:02,949
when we started talking with Chuck and

132
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,899
trip on the licensing things and being

133
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:07,389
able to feel comfortable sharing

134
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:08,319
information we're going you know latest

135
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,300
like you guys are starting your own

136
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,639
edible company anything else we're going

137
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:16,060
to share our recipes and our process and

138
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,050
the science behind it and we quickly you

139
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,970
know we worked through a lot of that

140
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,250
stuff because we had the experience in

141
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,620
food science and manufacturing which

142
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,110
week we could also lend to Dixie and

143
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,470
really help elevate each other's brands

144
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,610
where they're really strong we were a

145
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,740
little weaker where they were a little

146
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,110
weaker worse we were we had we had some

147
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,579
more expertise and so we're very big i

148
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,259
come from the restaurant industry where

149
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:40,719
restaurants the camaraderie between

150
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,189
chefs and restaurant tours we constantly

151
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,050
help each other out we loaned the

152
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:47,290
neighbor restaurant a bottle of vodka if

153
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,120
they run out or you know i just ran out

154
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,439
of sugar you run next door to your

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,269
neighbor restaurant and they loan it to

156
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,219
you you know there's not a lot of that

157
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,810
camaraderie in this business and we're

158
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,330
really starting to see that to where

159
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,490
like-minded individuals like-minded

160
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:02,189
brands can can really help each other

161
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,650
there's plenty of room on the shelves

162
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:08,079
for multiple brands that that are all

163
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:10,029
doing it in the right way so that we can

164
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,430
bring transparency and we can bring

165
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:15,099
safety and we can bring expectations

166
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,980
into this industry the industry with in

167
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,740
terms of camaraderie has as definitely

168
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,900
some room to grow and as we can all get

169
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,650
together and share trade secrets and

170
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:27,789
different things on how we do things

171
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:29,469
it's going to be great for the industry

172
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,640
and that's where i think that there's a

173
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,080
lot of like-minded people that are

174
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,899
starting to see that and come together

175
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,300
and say there's plenty of shelf space

176
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:39,068
there for the best in class

177
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,228
that that will help elevate this

178
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,030
industry that will help move the the

179
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:45,750
movement will help with legislation and

180
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:48,579
be part of it versus fight the system

181
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,408
and that's that's a big part of what we

182
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:51,848
want to do we are very open we have a

183
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:54,788
15,000 square foot manufacturing

184
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:56,889
facility in Salinas we have we have a

185
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:59,079
license business license actually States

186
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:02,500
cannabis infused products we've invited

187
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:05,620
we've had congressmen senators police

188
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,079
chiefs FBI all walk our facility torrid

189
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,840
other competition we've opened our doors

190
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,788
to everybody else to say listen it's an

191
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,168
open book let's let's get together and

192
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:15,490
make sure that we're all doing this in

193
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:17,948
the right manner so that we can elevate

194
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,990
this business and we can stand on this

195
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,598
on the steps of Congress or the Senate

196
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,418
and say listen we pay our taxes we're in

197
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,639
childproof packaging we do everything to

198
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:29,769
be a legitimate business and to continue

199
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,300
to give patients you know the medication

200
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:33,399
they need or in other states like

201
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,360
Colorado and stuff adults that are over

202
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:39,609
21 years of age an alternative to a way

203
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,439
to unwind at the end of a day's work or

204
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,718
to relax or to medicate in a way that

205
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,689
they see fit licensing in the cannabis

206
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:49,810
industry is always a very interesting

207
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:50,918
you know a pathway because there's so

208
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,339
many things that the federal government

209
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:57,758
still doesn't recognize contracts really

210
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:59,528
in the cannabis industry so you really

211
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,240
have the rights as was going to stand up

212
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:03,550
in court if you're going to do if it

213
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,379
ever came to that so it's really about

214
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,288
doing business deals with people that

215
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:09,728
you trust and like and you know I always

216
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,110
joke life's too short to be in business

217
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:13,930
people you don't enjoy being in business

218
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,310
with or working with and so that was one

219
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,098
of the great things with Dixie and all

220
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:21,129
thi is that we have the same mindset the

221
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:22,990
same goals long term with elevating this

222
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:25,090
industry you know but it's interesting

223
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,348
because we want to share ideas and share

224
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,598
product but you can't go across state

225
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:30,579
lines because they're federally

226
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,500
regulated and so you have to be able to

227
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,598
come up with systems where you know our

228
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,240
packaging comes from Colorado for Dixie

229
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,379
but we manufacture everything in

230
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,250
California so we buy all local

231
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:44,649
ingredients from California all

232
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:47,559
accustomed to their recipes and in touch

233
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,328
with that all of the cannabis and the

234
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,429
oil comes from Monterey County in santa

235
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:53,919
cruz county all the test results are

236
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:55,689
here in California so it's really

237
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,669
looking at how you build out markets and

238
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,920
being able to trust your brand because

239
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:02,379
as we all know your brand is everything

240
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:05,049
and to be able to sit down with

241
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:06,730
individuals and say listen here's my

242
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:08,559
baby that I've nurtured for five years

243
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,480
and we've created this amazing thing and

244
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,799
you know in the area of Dixie where

245
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,600
they've spent five years and built this

246
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,669
brand in Colorado that's so recognized

247
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,769
and to be able to turn that over you

248
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:19,958
know to us here in California know that

249
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,939
we will we'll treat that brand just as

250
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:24,579
they will in Colorado and to make sure

251
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,550
that the safety and the aspects and all

252
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,080
the manufacturing and science and

253
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:31,000
everything they put into their bars and

254
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,889
their products that will maintain that

255
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,570
quality standards you know it's great

256
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:36,129
with the licensing deal too and the

257
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,260
relationship that we have with Dixie as

258
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:40,570
we look at the markets the difference

259
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:43,389
between Colorado and California ologies

260
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,459
they are very vast you know California

261
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:48,759
has had a cannabis movement for over 20

262
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:50,439
years Colorado you know as much as they

263
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,139
passed us with their recreational or

264
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,900
adult use hace California was way ahead

265
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:57,759
of them and obviously the culture you

266
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,889
know with the growers everything that we

267
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,958
have here in California so we spend a

268
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:04,000
lot of time with Dixie whether we're in

269
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:06,579
Colorado where they come here and our

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,720
facility as we start to tweak recipes to

271
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,120
make sure you know there's no humidity

272
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,129
in Colorado or very little compared to

273
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,350
California and so recipes have to be

274
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:17,950
tweaked for that also making things at

275
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:20,379
7,000 feet elevation vs sea level all of

276
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,990
these things are taken into effect as we

277
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:24,580
build out recipes and product lines here

278
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,009
in California again you have a lot of

279
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,150
areas where people have been utilizing

280
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:30,338
the product for a long period of time

281
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,809
they're looking for higher dose so we've

282
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,000
taken things like the toasted rooster

283
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:36,789
that was 84 milligrams in Colorado and

284
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,078
it's 180 milligrams here now again it's

285
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:42,789
it's scored for 15 milligrams per square

286
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:45,009
I think when anybody looks at doing a

287
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:47,289
licensing deal with another company is

288
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:51,789
really do your research look at the

289
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:54,189
brand understand if you're your core

290
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:56,588
concepts your core values are aligned

291
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,970
and also do you like the individuals

292
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,950
that you're doing business with because

293
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,709
hopefully it's going to be a long-term

294
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,000
deal I would always stay away from

295
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,869
short-term things putting your toe in

296
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,519
the water

297
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,230
you don't want to go out and build some

298
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,120
of these brand put bring everything into

299
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,399
a bunch of entries and then walk away

300
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,759
from that in the year so always looking

301
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,289
for long-term relationships and do your

302
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,289
research really dive into things

303
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:22,870
understand what is the what is the the

304
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:24,759
consumers feeling about this brand what

305
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,940
is the industry's feeling about this

306
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:30,159
brand and to make sure that when you

307
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,080
when you go into a partnership like this

308
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:36,809
you're bringing the right brand the

309
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:40,210
right values the right package and

310
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:42,369
product to fill a void in your market in

311
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,440
the edible market you're going to see a

312
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,179
lot of growth over the next few years as

313
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,130
you've seen in the last year I mean the

314
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:50,679
the markets I think quadrupled in the

315
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:53,439
edibles when you talk to Steve DeAngelo

316
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,909
and harborside edibles used to make up

317
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,450
this tiny little portion of the

318
00:11:54,909 --> 00:12:00,610
Harborside in a corner two years ago and

319
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,740
now it has primetime space right in the

320
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,710
middle as they're seeing consumers

321
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,330
continuing to move towards that if they

322
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,920
especially here in California where

323
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,290
smoking people are so sensitive to

324
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,329
smoking for smoking flower edible seems

325
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:15,610
like it's it's it's not this illegal

326
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,730
thing right it's hate popping a piece of

327
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,320
milk chocolate or a bonbon doesn't feel

328
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,080
illegal but it gives me the medication

329
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,970
it gives me the relaxation that the

330
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,190
feeling that I'm looking for in a way

331
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,840
that I am NOT you know publicly out

332
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:32,800
there smoking or

333
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,990
and you know any other ways you're

334
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,240
looking to ingest the the product I

335
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,159
think it's you know beverages are

336
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,750
definitely an area Dixie elixir in

337
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,519
Colorado I mean it's more than fifty

338
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,740
percent of their revenues is their lick

339
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,199
sirs and their sodas it's definitely a

340
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,360
popular area to go again for people who

341
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,710
don't drink and to be able to go out and

342
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,259
and be able to be social with people

343
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:55,090
these days and be able to have their

344
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:58,059
their soda their medicine their thing

345
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,250
that's equal to a glass of wine or a

346
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:02,079
beer and have a Dixie one which is you

347
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,019
know 10 milligrams it's pretty much

348
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,790
equivalent to a glass of wine or a mixed

349
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:11,500
cocktail and be able to be social like

350
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:12,849
that in the in that marketplace so I

351
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,629
think you're going to see continued more

352
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,009
low dose items more regulation where you

353
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,350
actually know what's in the product

354
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:22,090
everything's tested versus being Saran

355
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,399
wrapped with a sticker on it or

356
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,019
something like that to where regulations

357
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,970
going you know regulations and good

358
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:30,970
things in different areas to keep people

359
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,410
safe so tamper-proof packaging it's

360
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,550
definitely going to be a big area that

361
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:35,379
you're going to see things moving down

362
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:38,169
and again low doses people start to

363
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:39,909
experiment back into this industry and

364
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:43,089
understanding what their comfort level

365
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:44,559
is and to be able to be social and just

366
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,060
be able to take the edge off as we've

367
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,259
jumped into this industry it's been

368
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,119
interesting it's been a year in the

369
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,309
works we've actually had product on the

370
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,560
shelves now for only eight weeks both

371
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:56,409
all tie and Dixie and we continue to

372
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:59,169
grow the team we have 10 sales reps

373
00:13:56,409 --> 00:14:00,549
throughout California that that build

374
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:02,740
out everything and visit all the

375
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:05,949
dispensaries we have a manufacturing

376
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,289
team right now of about 15 people that

377
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,690
work you know monday through friday our

378
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:12,339
plants 15,000 square feet it's all

379
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,740
automated so we have the ability to

380
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,980
really ramp up and and look towards that

381
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,019
ramp of you know november 2016 when most

382
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,690
of us here think that california will go

383
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:25,269
adult use that will go into effect most

384
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,980
likely in january of 18 but really

385
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:29,199
ramping up for that and so as we see

386
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,909
that will need to really build the

387
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,100
manufacturing side out and make sure

388
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:34,350
that we can handle

389
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,970
the the new influx of people that are

390
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,329
very interested in the industry and

391
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,639
looking to try a different alternative

392
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:44,059
when it comes to you know social being

393
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,060
social
