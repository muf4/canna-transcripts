1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,318
all right morning

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,000
good morning so i'm sol alba from

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:11,120
beneficial insectary

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,480
michael arsenault maven we're here to

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,838
talk about some

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,039
natural enemy releases and some tips on

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,320
how to do it

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,679
um we're starting with you know the

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,439
general soil predators um that can be

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,480
used together we're talking about

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,399
delosha corey aria uh the roe field

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,200
predatory rope beetle

13
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:39,200
targets drips pre-pupa and fungus gnat

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,719
it's formerly known as a theta choriaria

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,760
but the entomologists

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,359
that the taxonomist and the

17
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,799
insect taxonomist changed that recently

18
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,320
along with that we're going to release

19
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,878
uh stradiolaelips symmetus which is

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,558
the predatory soil might also target

21
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:02,079
serps and fungus gnat

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,239
um this one was known but as a

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,680
hypo aspis most people still know it as

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,960
hypo aspis but

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,000
we just call them strats so anyway

26
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:15,118
um first thing you want to do

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,640
basically uh when you uh show up and are

28
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,000
prepping for a release

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,118
is to acclimate the bugs um

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,560
you know they come in in ice packed in

31
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,719
ice

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,960
so you want to warm it up you know it's

33
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,640
a i guess would be the equivalent of

34
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,039
you waking up somebody waking you up

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,960
with like a bucket full of ice water

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960
right you kind of want to acclimate it

37
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,679
to the grow conditions so

38
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,919
as you can see right here we we have

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:48,079
both containers

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,079
this is a this is the soil predator mite

41
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:58,000
and this is

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,000
the predatory rove beetle

43
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,718
and we have these acclimating here to

44
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,718
get to the ground temperature

45
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,560
basically we're going to show you how we

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,280
do it

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,159
so after this acclimation um what you

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,439
want to do

49
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,959
is you want to inspect

50
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:24,400
them for viability so

51
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,759
just tap them out and you'll see them

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
there

53
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,359
they're called rove beetles because they

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,080
just

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,519
move everywhere they're just constantly

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,760
like mini search

57
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,759
yeah kind of like that right they flip

58
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,120
their tails up like all road beetles do

59
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,239
oops so anyway those all look pretty

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,080
viable

61
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,400
um bro fields do fly

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,200
they're not great fighters but they do

63
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
fly so

64
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,518
that's a huge advantage strats are a

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,680
little bit more difficult to

66
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,920
see but often you can see them crawling

67
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,920
on the

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,360
there's none there

69
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,719
[Music]

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,560
but yeah you want to carefully inspect

71
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,800
for the viability

72
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,878
[Music]

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,239
it may require a loop so you may not be

74
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,799
able to see them

75
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,560
really and then they also could still be

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,920
sluggish we didn't quite wait

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,000
you know the 30 to 45 minutes and that

78
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:28,958
we should have so

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,199
for purposes of moving this video along

80
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
we'll uh we'll take a closer video to

81
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,598
show you what they look like when

82
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,200
they're crawling around

83
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,079
um although you know that pretty much

84
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:41,759
shows you and

85
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,560
they're just mites so i think i did say

86
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,919
the

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,360
white carrying you know the little foam

88
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,919
top for the

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,920
refrigerated box yeah

90
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,280
so um this is

91
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,640
probably these are probably enough mites

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,199
for

93
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,958
several um i think i remember

94
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,679
calculating somewhere like 600 square

95
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,840
feet

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,040
something like that so we're going to

97
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,759
overload them here but

98
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,598
there's a living soil so mike really

99
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,000
wanted to try to establish them

100
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,280
and that's one of the beauties of the of

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,279
this

102
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,478
these predators here in particular is um

103
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,638
both of these are some of the easiest

104
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:28,319
to get to establish in your growth in

105
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,360
fact um that

106
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:34,319
uh that was the case

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,160
um the farm i work with where we need

108
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,959
very few releases to actually get them

109
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,320
to establish

110
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,120
they like them they like your

111
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,120
environment they will uh

112
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,478
they'll establish readily so if you

113
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,639
don't have like

114
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,758
heavy fungus that pressure or heavy

115
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,319
thrust pressure

116
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,879
um and there's not an abundant food

117
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,599
source

118
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,240
in the soil with those two uh pests what

119
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,080
other

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,280
things can these guys you know that's

121
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,879
that's a good question

122
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,799
um some mites will eat uh fungus i'm not

123
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,000
sure if hypoaspis

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,960
eats or strats eat fungus um about like

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,120
springtails right

126
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,918
tails is yeah springtails are great in

127
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,720
fact i'm working on a rearing system for

128
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,399
delosha um which requires rearing

129
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,039
springtails first and then feeding that

130
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,879
to them

131
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,240
and just for fun there's some

132
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,839
springtails buried in this bed

133
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,918
are they well they'll help you with

134
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,799
those it's an extra food source for them

135
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,478
um

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
i don't know which is their preference

137
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,839
but these are frequently used

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,520
as um an adjunct to

139
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,359
nematodes for fungus not control

140
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,719
but the nematodes are obviously your

141
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,000
best choice but

142
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,160
two more weapons right

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,800
speaking about speaking of rearing

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,960
springtails um

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,840
lot of growers don't know this it's been

146
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,879
done for

147
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:56,079
for a while now other greenhouse

148
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,560
operations of other crops

149
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,000
you can build what are called delosha

150
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,680
breeder boxes

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,680
basically that is you know a box where

152
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,160
you have a food source and salt the soil

153
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,000
and you release some of your delosia in

154
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,680
that

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,800
and it's covered you allow them to

156
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,720
reproduce and colonies form

157
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,919
because you've given them food and so

158
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,759
you have all sorts of

159
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,719
life stages you have eggs you have

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,080
nymphs or larva and you have the adults

161
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,400
and then you can open the box

162
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,719
and adults will leave the box but you

163
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,758
have this generation in the box it's

164
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,880
essentially constantly producing um row

165
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,038
beetles

166
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,478
and you just very simple to maintain you

167
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,199
know every once in a while you add some

168
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,800
food

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,400
keep them moist and and

170
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,639
you know this has been done for a while

171
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,598
i've done it um it's really cool it's

172
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,960
like a little

173
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:57,918
mini insectary or you could call it like

174
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,680
a giant delosha sachets you know if you

175
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,719
know what a sachet is

176
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,160
anyway um so yeah um

177
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,479
it's really pretty simple to release

178
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,919
these um and like we said we want them

179
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,719
warmed up so they're moving

180
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,000
and um it's just that really you can

181
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,479
either tap them

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,759
you know tap them in you know but

183
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,758
they're uh

184
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:23,759
they're probably like these are also

185
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,038
you know pretty pretty tough beetles

186
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,199
what's the carrier like cocoa and

187
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,120
vermiculite yeah it's a it's a cocoa and

188
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,199
vermiculite carrier pretty much i'm

189
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,360
sorry pete and vermiculite carrier

190
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,520
let's see them right there so we're

191
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,160
gonna go ahead and

192
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:45,839
empty this container

193
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,840
these guys will

194
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:59,359
um you can actually

195
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:02,000
do flats like this but they're wet so

196
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,240
the carrier will stick obviously to the

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,720
leaf but if you've got them

198
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,079
where they're if you have them where

199
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,599
they're um

200
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,120
you know with without the dome and

201
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,240
they're fairly dry then

202
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,038
you can just shake the uh you can just

203
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,598
shake the

204
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,680
extra carrier off the leaves once once

205
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:22,800
the beetles have

206
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,280
moved down into into the soil

207
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,560
or fake soil or whatever whatever it is

208
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,439
i'm gonna hand this over to

209
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:41,839
mike here nice and you pop out in the

210
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:41,838
back there

211
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,399
whoa

212
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:11,679
a little bit left

213
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:11,679
all right

214
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,159
so

215
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,399
now for the strats you know the same

216
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,440
idea

217
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,080
you can sprinkle them or in this case a

218
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
lot better to

219
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,879
just stand out are there feeder mites in

220
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,039
the lotion as well

221
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:39,200
in the strats you mean or in the um

222
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,159
i'm not sure that we it was a real

223
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,278
beetle

224
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:46,079
um i'm not sure what's in the carrier

225
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:48,000
um if anything they might have put some

226
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,480
some eggs

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,000
of feeder feeding eggs like zamoth

228
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,959
um that lays eggs that we can use

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,759
for for feeding certain predators i'm

230
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,759
not sure

231
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,919
i know delosha eats those i've seen them

232
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,200
do it

233
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:09,759
with the mites i don't think so

234
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,120
that's why we do overnight shipping just

235
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,639
to get them to you

236
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:19,679
you know get them out you go

237
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:21,120
thanks sir oh it's important too

238
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,799
i don't know mike it might remember to

239
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,399
do it over there but what's that you

240
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,199
kind of want to leave these

241
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
caps and the open bottles out in the

242
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,839
grill for a while

243
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,000
nice in case you know it's just a good

244
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,480
practice

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,480
it's a

246
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,000
it's as simple as that probably the

247
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,838
easiest

248
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,839
release there is out there it's a

249
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,560
no-brainer

250
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:59,120
and like we said it's both of these have

251
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,119
the ability whoops the ability to

252
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,159
establish

253
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,120
readily in your growth

254
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,399
um i've even seen them actually at

255
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,159
mike's operation

256
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,440
um these actually haven't has them

257
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:18,078
established

258
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,560
in a rockwool media and

259
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,319
another grower i know in l.a downtown

260
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,439
l.a

261
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,320
had a natural a native

262
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,120
native population of delosha that is

263
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,079
established

264
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,120
oh yeah along with strategies they never

265
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,039
released but they were there

266
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,320
they're everywhere delosha was the

267
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,480
gateway

268
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,040
uh benny for our facility so they didn't

269
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,639
like to invest into venues because they

270
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,240
didn't think they would persist

271
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,720
and then one day uh during a cut down

272
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,519
i'm seeing some delosha rolling through

273
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,639
the rockwool cubes this is probably

274
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,759
i'm guessing six months post you know

275
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,360
last introduction into the field and

276
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,799
when i showed that to my cultivation

277
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,120
manager he was like

278
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,719
okay well we'll you can get back to

279
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,320
ordering those since those do seem to

280
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,070
persist and that with the nematodes

281
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,109
really seem to

282
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,109
[Music]

283
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,838
not so much for us because you know our

284
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
business is selling

285
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,040
family and beneficials and you're

286
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,360
essentially getting one that tends to

287
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,439
establish

288
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,120
but uh that's fine we just want bio

289
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,320
control to work for you

290
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,320
that's pretty much it um

291
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:39,839
easy right definitely it's my

292
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,839
insurance policy thank you
