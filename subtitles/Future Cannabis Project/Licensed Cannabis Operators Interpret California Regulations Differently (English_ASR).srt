1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,890
what's interesting and concerning to me

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,870
at the same time is on each question I'm

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:08,789
finding that throughout the supply chain

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,089
you are interpreting the regs

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:16,278
differently and so if you're gonna

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:19,649
reflect back what are what could we do

7
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:21,240
to make sure and I know you're going to

8
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,909
tell me I know we got to get information

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,320
out but with all of our other

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,469
responsibilities do you have any good

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,018
ideas for us where we could do a better

12
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:34,369
job of explaining the regs I mean maybe

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:37,350
it starts with the regs themselves but

14
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:39,659
you know I think there's better ways to

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,879
get the information out and and one

16
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:45,089
thing that I worry about as we come to

17
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:47,009
the final leg of our rulemaking how do

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,289
we make sure we're continuing to

19
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:52,019
communicate and collaborate we've done

20
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,210
it a lot getting these regs out but how

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,250
do we going forward make sure we keep

22
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,640
that momentum so I'd love your thoughts

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,399
on that you know I think there's an

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,579
agency to agency component right so a

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,460
lot of the operators are are kind of

26
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,658
wrangling multiple sets of regulations

27
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,539
that they have to comply with

28
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,969
cultivators have California Department

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,790
of Food and Agriculture open air

30
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:19,140
cultivators have the water board the

31
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,970
water resource control board they have

32
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,840
Department of Fish and Wildlife and then

33
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,950
depending on how they choose to

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840
transport their product if they have say

35
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,618
a self distribution transportation

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:36,750
license now they have BCC right and and

37
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:39,390
so how how like as a cultivator we

38
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,640
digest that body of material is really

39
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,868
challenging and then I find that there's

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,310
not always the same I don't know if

41
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:49,859
definition is the right word but maybe

42
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,469
interpretation of specific definitions

43
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,349
from statute so like we're really

44
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:57,298
suffering with the continuous premise

45
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:59,009
component especially as existing

46
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,250
cultivators that already built out right

47
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,750
how do we fit into that box but BCC

48
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,938
seems to have a little different way of

49
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,949
dealing with contiguous premise and say

50
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:12,959
CD FA or CD pH so those pieces make it

51
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,500
really kind of a quicksand feeling

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,009
because

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,259
you're not sure who to look to for

54
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:22,859
answers in some of those cases so I

55
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:28,799
think kind of more interagency

56
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:30,570
communication and sort of joint

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,240
educational opportunities would be

58
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,430
really fabulous you know what I was

59
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,830
yearning for in this in this last round

60
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,280
of these of the draft regulations and

61
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,200
also actually with July 1 in lab there's

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,939
not a lot of us who are currently

63
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,409
offering I think there's maybe 30 or

64
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,180
maybe more licensees now as they keep

65
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,949
adding on but in terms of operators it's

66
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,060
it's I think it's less than 15 probably

67
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:56,519
right now and what we're doing is fairly

68
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,920
complicated there's a lot of details and

69
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,110
if we get it wrong we can have a serious

70
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,269
economic impact on a party completely

71
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,680
unintentionally by making by

72
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,420
misinterpreting something to miss

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,420
applying it on a CoA that then can't be

74
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,559
amended and so when those transitions

75
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,149
happen I said you know why it would have

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,400
been really great from a collaboration

77
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,620
perspective if we could have gotten the

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,719
lab operators on the phone with the

79
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,090
regulator's to really walk through what

80
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,280
what the ask from us was in terms of

81
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,719
changes to help us understand the label

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,379
claim thing has been a little over the

83
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:31,080
top to understand what it means what has

84
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:33,090
to be what doesn't have to be where's

85
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,709
the where's the area of permissions

86
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,870
where's the area of no permissions and

87
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:39,209
so I think like a literally a simple

88
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,890
conference call with the lab operators

89
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,629
because we're a small number would have

90
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,159
been amazing and it would have cleared

91
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,229
up a lot of kind of disparate things

92
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,669
between us which affected the

93
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,560
manufacturers and it affected

94
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,289
distributors because our interpretations

95
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,370
affect everybody in a big way now I

96
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:54,719
don't I don't think that's totally

97
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,129
doable for everybody because there's a

98
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,709
lot more manufacturers and a lot more

99
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,900
distributors than there are labs so that

100
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,479
may not be applicable for each group but

101
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,860
that approach which may mean maybe there

102
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,599
needs to be more funding for outreach

103
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,420
personnel that are specifically just

104
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,430
about outreach and about giving voice to

105
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:12,958
that interpretation because there's

106
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,849
there's a difference in having a

107
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,500
discussion like with Elena who's Ben

108
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:19,469
who's an amazing resource on your team

109
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,728
to help understand the regulations but I

110
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,200
think there's people who don't feel like

111
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,899
they have that personal connection to

112
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,360
the BCC team or a go-to person and

113
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,978
somehow we need to create that sense of

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,629
everybody knows who to go to and that

115
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,699
person has the bandwidth to answer them

116
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:35,699
because there there's a lot of us yeah

117
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:39,478
yeah um you know California is the only

118
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,669
state that has multiple agencies

119
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:46,318
regulating one supply chain in cannabis

120
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:48,859
so that's very unique and you know

121
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,729
obviously causes lots of problems with

122
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,699
interpretation and who has authority

123
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:56,068
over what and I would say you know

124
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,960
something the CDT FA does that they

125
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:59,069
started a couple of months ago and

126
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,168
they've only had a couple but they've

127
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:06,150
invited a couple of operators from

128
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:08,938
distributors and retailers to discuss

129
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:11,218
the just the excise tax and and how the

130
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,830
tax structure is paid and what's going

131
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:15,810
on and and we ask them questions and

132
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:17,699
they ask us questions and we kind of

133
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,519
just have this sort of informal

134
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,259
back-and-forth conversation so that's

135
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:26,008
been pretty helpful because that's been

136
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,840
unbelievably confusing on its own and so

137
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:31,020
that might be an idea I know there's the

138
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:34,258
Advisory Committee which is very formal

139
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:38,098
and and sort of there by law but some

140
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:41,490
sort of more informal stakeholder

141
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:46,259
licensee conversation and right now

142
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:48,060
since there aren't a ton of licensees if

143
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,639
it probably would be easier to do at

144
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,129
this point then you know six months or a

145
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,199
year later when if there's more coming

146
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:59,278
out as more places and people get online

147
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,838
and I think the other thing is you know

148
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:03,028
going back to this packaging and

149
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:06,598
labeling which has just been a you know

150
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:09,449
interesting transition and our different

151
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:13,860
interpretations of you know what is

152
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:15,900
required I think having a a general

153
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,069
understanding because we were in the

154
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:22,769
position I you know the retailer BPG was

155
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,449
saying that we are we're licensed and

156
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:26,968
inspected by the bureau so we're gonna

157
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:30,210
go with what the bureau says and what

158
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:32,848
statute says and then there's CD pH that

159
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:34,500
has what they have and then that's what

160
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:37,740
them I think this also comes down to why

161
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,120
there may have been some difference in

162
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:46,259
interpretation we're friends now though

163
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,850
and yeah so I you know one of the sort

164
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,170
of more specific nuanced things would

165
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,760
come down to sort of the you know

166
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,290
statute says everything has to be in a

167
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,839
resealable child-resistant

168
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,340
tamper-evident it's in one sentence and

169
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,459
it says cannabis and cannabis products

170
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,500
and so that means everything from seeds

171
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,689
to clones and and the seeds and clones I

172
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,250
would say was a very interesting

173
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:10,100
question because that's what statute

174
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:14,189
says CD pH doesn't address it you

175
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:16,200
California DFA doesn't address it and so

176
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:18,959
you know we are erring on the side of

177
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,360
caution because we're like well I the

178
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,849
Bureau is the one inspecting us not DPH

179
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,189
so we're just going to go as far

180
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,320
conservative as we possibly can and then

181
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,639
and that's what I I mean the staff kind

182
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,110
of they're frustrated with me too

183
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,519
because that's sort of how I go I'm like

184
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,470
we're gonna ease up as we realize that

185
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,409
we can but we're just gonna start with

186
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,690
the strictest interpretation but yeah so

187
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,900
sort of the the crossover areas and

188
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:44,759
addressing those and and who has you

189
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,049
know what are you guys looking for when

190
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,670
you're coming in to inspect the

191
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,379
dispensary when it comes to packaging

192
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:54,300
and labeling stuff like that I I would

193
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:56,219
as a lawyer kind of shift towards you

194
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,720
know when statutes are interpreted

195
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,940
greatly for the business community by

196
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,950
case law and in case law and forms and

197
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:04,860
different fact in our scenarios how one

198
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,439
would behave the IRS uses decisional

199
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,330
memos I think that it might not be a bad

200
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,189
idea to do something like decisional

201
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:13,469
memos that have an expiry date on them

202
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:16,469
so that the statute says they change

203
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,030
those decisions kind of become but it

204
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,070
would really help us out a lot while

205
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,559
we're really the front line I mean if we

206
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:25,199
fail state fails right so it helps us

207
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,620
out in defining how we should go and and

208
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,629
I would absolutely agree one body to

209
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:35,429
making those decisions and in itself

210
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:37,950
working with CD pH or working with the

211
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:39,750
other departments to come up with a

212
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,970
decisional memo that is consonant across

213
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,779
the board so that we can make a decision

214
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:49,080
for example if I have a cultivation

215
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:51,059
license can I can I package for somebody

216
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,710
kayak egde somebody else's flour just

217
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:53,559
off of my farm like it's really not

218
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,360
clear

219
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,649
so and it doesn't have to be clear and

220
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
we don't have to wait for regulators to

221
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,679
make that decision but I think in the

222
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,720
interim if the bureau could just make a

223
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,729
decision for right now for the rest of

224
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,100
this year our interpretation is that

225
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,100
would be acceptable that allows us to

226
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:14,559
mount this effort without the constant

227
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:17,740
fear that we're going to get you know

228
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:21,909
Thor's hammer on our back and so there's

229
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,990
a lot of that fear of how to move and if

230
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,579
we could have some clearance on that

231
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,360
it's kind of like an FAQ but it's a

232
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:32,020
little bit more formal right so just an

233
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,389
idea to throw out there I think it's

234
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:36,009
been great the way that the agencies are

235
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:37,659
willing to travel around the state to

236
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:41,830
listen to all of us during the public

237
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:42,969
comments and I think it would be you

238
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,370
know there's a there's a huge

239
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:49,420
cross-section of companies some which

240
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:51,909
have staffed up to have policy

241
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:54,969
professionals focusing on the regs on a

242
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:57,209
daily basis and then there's companies

243
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,920
that don't have that resource and they

244
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:03,550
utilize their industry associations or

245
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,990
word of mouth or you know call the

246
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:07,120
bureau up but it would I think it'd be

247
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,210
great if there could be ongoing

248
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,210
opportunities for the agencies to in

249
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,389
different parts of the state have

250
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:19,629
workshops that are designed to focus on

251
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:20,889
their regs and clarify and educate and I

252
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:22,240
think that probably you would get a lot

253
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:23,199
of participation there's a lot of hungry

254
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,120
minds

255
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,070
I know it's it might open a new can of

256
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,539
worms if one answer at one venue is

257
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,400
different than another answer at another

258
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:34,599
venue so obviously not a perfect

259
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,429
solution but I think there's a lot of

260
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,490
people that be interested to come in

261
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:44,019
here and learn this is what we mean when

262
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:46,690
we say this so I completely agree with

263
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:49,120
you it can be frustrating for us just

264
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,430
asked our communication guys on when

265
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,700
people don't when they call and say what

266
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:56,679
agency do we go to or for us it does get

267
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,509
frustrating because it doesn't even even

268
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:01,449
internally it's difficult to work with

269
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:05,169
two other agencies and come to decisions

270
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,720
and and being consistent also it's you

271
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:10,958
know like you noted we do want to do

272
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,209
or outreach but we're also dealing with

273
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,969
new staff coming on every day and it's

274
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:17,469
hard to keep them apprised of okay these

275
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,899
are the these are the regulations that

276
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,990
are in place right now and and so we

277
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:26,078
struggle with making sure that we're

278
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,879
giving consistent answers and you're not

279
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,008
getting different answers and I think

280
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,539
you'll see once we get our final

281
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:33,339
regulations it's going to make a lot

282
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:35,769
easier we don't have the emergency

283
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:38,529
regulations the proposed and all that so

284
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:42,639
this is all really very helpful you know

285
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:45,698
I I could I could keep interrogating

286
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,129
these guys more but I think you guys

287
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:50,438
want to answer some question questions

288
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:52,778
of them but I do want to point out that

289
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:54,370
we did get approval our budget got

290
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:57,879
approved to have a public awareness

291
00:11:54,370 --> 00:12:00,459
campaign we are going out to bid so we

292
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:03,278
are gonna get out there and start having

293
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:05,318
a campaign to inform consumers of who's

294
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,740
licensed the importance of going to a

295
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:10,990
licensed retailer and also trying to

296
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,579
bring more people from the unlicensed

297
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,019
market into the regulated market so

298
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:15,489
that'll be something exciting you're

299
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:16,659
going to see from our communications

300
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,139
team so we're looking forward to that

301
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:22,179
but this has been extremely helpful to

302
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:26,360
me and I really appreciate you guys

303
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:46,798
being so candid with your answers

304
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:46,798
