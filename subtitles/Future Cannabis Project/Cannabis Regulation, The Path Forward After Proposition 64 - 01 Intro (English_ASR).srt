immediately are we ready for next

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,840
January so today's hearing we examine a

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,118
rapidly evolving policy topic that has

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,280
captured uh the attention of the state

45
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:50,519
and many local municipalities concerned

46
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,680
with cannabis regulation now that the

47
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,000
voters have passed by initiative medical

48
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,240
and recreational use the issue of

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,640
cannabis regulation is not in new to

50
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:00,039
California and local governments have

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,118
been grappling with it for for

52
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,680
approximately 20 years since the 1996

53
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,920
passage of proposition 215 the state

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,560
mostly deferred to cities and counties

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,759
as they created a patchwork of local

56
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,759
laws in an attempt to regulate this

57
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,639
complicated industry the 2015 enactment

58
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,679
of the medical marijuana regulation and

59
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,199
safety act uh mcrsa for the first time

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,280
helped to establish a Statewide

61
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:27,199
framework for the use of medical

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,560
cannabis uh mcrsa charged three agencies

63
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,799
the California Department of food and

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,000
egg the department of Public Health and

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,599
the Department of Consumer Affairs with

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,439
the responsibility of creating

67
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:39,639
regulations that would protect patients

68
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:42,199
industry and the public the November 8th

69
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,799
passage of proposition 64 or the adult

70
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:47,000
use of marijuana act further intensify

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,040
the need for oversight of the regulatory

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,479
process with the looming January 1 2018

73

regulations now applicable for both

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,519
adults use and medical cannabis it is

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,360
even more essential for honest and

77
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,800
consistent communication between the

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,799

86
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,679

and and here today uh how how we how we

102
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:59,798
going to interface uh prop 64 with the

103
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,959
work of the legislature as one of the

104
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,400
authors of of of the mcrsa I'm

105
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,640
particularly interested in that uh as

106
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,920
the chair of the health committee I have

107
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:11,039
some some interest and concern about how

108
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,399
we're going to in in input uh

109
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,039
legislation not legislation but

110
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,040
regulations around protecting Public

111
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,759
Safety and uh this is an emergency

112
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,560
emerging industry that changes uh

113
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,240
changes rapidly so I'm very interested

114
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,240
in the strategies that our Public Health

115
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,639
Department is is taking uh I don't want

116
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,918
to say too much more I think there's

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,079
there's going to be plenty of comments

118
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:33,560
here today but I'm looking forward to uh

119
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,879
how in particular uh when mcrsa was

120
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,120
signed by the governor in October 2015

121
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,918
it had a very very very uh particular

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,399
way in which uh agencies were going to

123
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,799
be produ uh performing oversight in this

124
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,198
industry in June through a budget

125
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,639
trailer Bill there were changes there

126
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,240
were significant changes and then prop

127
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,360
64 threw some of those things back the

128
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,000
way they were so I'm interested in how

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,160
we reconcile where we were in June of

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,879
2016

131
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,160
prior to the election um and then what

132
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,879
with with 200 with the election in 2016

133
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,680
in November how we reconcile those two

134
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,159
challenges which I think are are are

135
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,918
potentially pretty daunting so um thank

136
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,680
you Mr chair thank you Mr wood uh Miss

137

New World comes a um significant amount

140
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,120
of anxiety and I think the uh uh the

141
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,038
opportunity that we have here today is

142
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,959
to talk about how the regulatory process

143
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:37,120
is um is proceeding and to give some

144
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,879
kind of of of oversight to hopefully

145
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,000
elay some of the anxiety whether it be

146
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,560
in cities and counties or um for the

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,279
regulated industry so I look forward to

148
