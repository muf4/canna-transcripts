1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,770
where we are tuned into a morning

2
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:06,959
breakfast briefing the title of this

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:10,050
conversation but we will cover a variety

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,849
of topics is essential and on the brink

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:19,528
of collapse a weighty start to your day

6
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:22,850
take it away mr. Tom Hines so I guess

7
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:26,309
the genesis for this discussion was

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:28,859
anecdotal discussions that we've all

9
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:32,098
been having with business owners people

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,100
in the industry and also a series of

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:38,519
three very recent articles one in the

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:44,100
Sacramento Bee one in MJ beers and then

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:46,469
a Forbes article basically same thing

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,460
that California cannabis even though

15
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:53,189
it's deemed essential is in crisis and I

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:58,378
think what we want to do is kind of dig

17
00:00:53,189 --> 00:01:02,250
down into that kind of talk about why

18
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:05,670
it's happening what's the result of the

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,849
pandemic what issues were percolating

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,969
already and we're aggregating by the

21
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:13,469
current situation and what people are

22
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,978
doing about it

23
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:21,509
so I don't I think maybe the best thing

24
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:26,039
to do to start is to have everyone one

25
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:28,890
at a time kind of talk about within this

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,020
the perspective of this subject what

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,099
they're doing right now in the industry

28
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:36,539
and they can sort of weigh in if they

29
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,140
want with their general perspective

30
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:44,070
right now and we'd also like to get from

31
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:48,868
people you know because everyone here is

32
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:53,069
is is deeply involved in policy in in in

33
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:57,890
the in the the overview and the nuances

34
00:01:53,069 --> 00:02:00,419
of the industry to talk about about

35
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,930
what's really going on from your

36
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,099
perspective so give us an overview in an

37
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,789
under view and I think that would be

38
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:11,609
very helpful for whoever's listening who

39
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,309
do we want to start with who's who

40
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,890
why don't we

41
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,610
lower-left with Jackie and then will at

42
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:20,529
least on my screen and kind of just

43
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,599
introduce yourself for us Jackie tell us

44
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,890
what you're doing and you were one of

45
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:26,459
the people quoted in one of these

46
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:28,929
articles so give us your perspective

47
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,019
sure thanks Tom

48
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,599
my name is Jackie McGowan and I have a

49
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:37,420
consulting company called Green Street

50
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:39,699
consulting and a Facebook group called

51
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:43,689
California City and County regulation

52
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:46,179
launch where I set up 540 google email

53
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:48,340
alerts to every city and county in the

54
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,939
state four and a half years ago to

55
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:55,299
capture all of the movement at the local

56
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:57,280
level and I've been banning those Google

57
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,469
email alerts for the past four and a

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,360
half years and reading every article

59
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:05,348
that's come out in every jurisdiction in

60
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:10,330
the state and so the actual quote that I

61
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:13,719
gave to the Sacramento Bee who I view as

62
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:16,660
a very biased publication which is

63
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:20,500
unfortunate considering that it the the

64
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:23,680
state capitals newspaper but the editors

65
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,489
of the SAC be the editorial board came

66
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,670
out in opposition of Proposition 64 and

67
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:33,030
if you look back at the last year to two

68
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:36,578
years worth of articles in the SAC beat

69
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,049
they loved to harp on any negative

70
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:40,930
stories they do not like to tell

71
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:43,450
anything positive about cannabis and my

72
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:47,079
actual quote was that the industry was

73
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:51,699
on the verge of collapse prior to the

74
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:54,280
corona virus pandemic and that part got

75
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:58,388
edited out and and I had a few words

76
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,400
with the with the journalist you know

77
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:02,829
that that it wasn't acceptable that

78
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,439
they're not telling the entire story I

79
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:08,829
think that the media did the industry in

80
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,349
extreme disservice by you know

81
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,989
publishing article after article talking

82
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,608
about how there was significant increase

83
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:20,379
in sales and everybody was stocking up

84
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:22,870
because that just made everyone view or

85
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:25,899
continue to view the industry as a cash

86
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,850
cow which it is not you know

87
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:31,000
and it's not because there's so many

88
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:38,080
different people and agencies with their

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:43,449
hands out and it all does add up so I I

90
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:47,889
think that the industry was in some deep

91
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:50,889
trouble prior to this and given that

92
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:53,860
they've had to especially if you come at

93
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:58,030
it from a retail perspective retail has

94
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:01,449
had to come up with an entirely new

95
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:03,519
business model and the reason that I

96
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:07,800
believe that the industry is on the

97
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,459
brink of failing is because that

98
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,680
business model

99
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:19,959
it worked for existing retail when

100
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,180
people were visiting retail stores you

101
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:25,120
know there's a there's one store in in

102
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:28,750
San Jose that prior to the pandemic was

103
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,949
seeing 1,500 people a day and I don't

104
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:36,519
know how you replicate servicing 1500

105
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:39,340
people a day and be profitable if you

106
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:42,848
have to do curbside delivery and a

107
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:45,459
curbside pickup and and shifting to a

108
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:49,680
delivery model I don't think that the

109
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:53,138
the numbers pan out to pay expensive

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,639
leases for real estate as well as

111
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,139
running a delivery business you know it

112
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,038
would make a lot more sense if they were

113
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:04,150
in industrial areas and that would bring

114
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,918
the cost of leasing down but that's not

115
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:08,620
something that you can just change in

116
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:14,198
the midst of a pandemic and so I think

117
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:17,889
that distributors have become sort of

118
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:22,110
the the credit master in in this game

119
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:24,759
and a lot of retailers have pushed off

120
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,470
their their credit on to the

121
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,908
distributors and when they blow out a

122
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,510
distributor they just switch to another

123
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:35,189
one and so we're seeing those accounts

124
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:37,810
receivables get larger and larger with

125
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:39,689
with many distributors if it doesn't

126
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,569
blow them out

127
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:45,509
so a distributor didn't get a license to

128
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,278
then become the financier of the the

129
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:51,658
cannabis industry and that's what's

130
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:53,968
happened and so I don't know I hope that

131
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:55,288
there's some other brains on this panel

132
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:57,118
today that can come up with some

133
00:06:55,288 --> 00:07:00,468
out-of-the-box solutions because we are

134
00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:03,709
we're in some serious terrible territory

135
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:08,848
well that's my perspective

136
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:09,869
Chenin and you wanna well weigh in I'm

137
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:12,449
Cheyenne Manhattan

138
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:15,029
I am co-founder and CEO of insular

139
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:18,088
screens and high-tech district we've

140
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:20,550
been in the industry in California for

141
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:24,569
about 10 years coming out of the prop

142
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:27,119
215 market we were one of the earlier

143
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:30,949
adopters of getting our prospects before

144
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:34,739
license so it's kind of a running joke

145
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:37,079
in our organization of uh Shannon she's

146
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:39,988
the first one to ever do it you know

147
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,449
we've we've spent a lot of time helping

148
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:45,268
regulators figure out how to implement

149
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:48,629
some of their rules at the local and at

150
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:51,658
the state level and yeah it's been a

151
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:54,899
battle we started this as cultivators

152
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:57,688
and tincture makers and I never imagined

153
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:59,819
we'd be in the distribution business but

154
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:01,860
we were having such a hard time finding

155
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:06,088
a distributor that could represent us

156
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,459
and meet the needs of our clients most

157
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:10,139
of our products are non psychoactive so

158
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:11,819
I thought that was a tough sell in the

159
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,179
early days that we were selling weed

160
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:18,269
that didn't get you high so we started

161
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:20,908
our own sales team and in the last few

162
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:22,769
months with COBIT and just some of the

163
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:27,778
extinction going on in the distribution

164
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:29,968
space we've taken on a lot more at the

165
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:32,278
last mile fulfillment and we're actually

166
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,568
onboarding other small brands right now

167
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,179
that are getting pushed out by the

168
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:37,948
distributors and really just trying to

169
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,438
build that portfolio of boutique

170
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:42,688
heritage products and keep the people

171
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:45,468
that built this industry viable 3 that's

172
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,468
next transition

173
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:57,759
Amandla good morning had unmute myself

174
00:08:54,509 --> 00:09:00,100
so that's good to see everyone I hope

175
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,289
everyone's doing well this morning so

176
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,209
I'm Amanda Ryman and I'm currently the

177
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:05,558
vice president of community development

178
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:08,678
at Flo kana

179
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:11,678
we are also distribution i've resonate a

180
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:13,928
lot with what jackie was saying so we

181
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:16,119
are based up here in Mendocino County

182
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:18,999
and we work with a network of

183
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:20,800
independently owned small farms their

184
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:24,699
son groans so that's kind of our our

185
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:27,278
brand is Sun grown product and we

186
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:29,498
distribute around the state and I think

187
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,720
you know in addition to what's already

188
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:33,610
been said as Jackie was saying you know

189
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,639
this isn't like Co vid caused these

190
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,678
issues and prior to this pandemic

191
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,999
happening there were some policy issues

192
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,909
that we were working very hard on that

193
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:45,339
we felt were necessary in order to move

194
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:48,159
the industry forward one of them being

195
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,439
tax reform one of them being market

196
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,600
expansion and the fact that cannabis is

197
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:54,099
banned in most of the state of

198
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,079
California even though they

199
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,928
overwhelmingly voted for legalization

200
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:00,818
and then banking at the federal level

201
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:04,480
and I think it's interesting that after

202
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:06,838
kovat happened these issues did not go

203
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,420
away in fact they became even more

204
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,829
necessary and I think Kovan actually

205
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:14,349
started to give us some talking points

206
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:16,769
around these issues that we hadn't had

207
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:19,389
before and you know it's interesting

208
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:22,808
I've been working in cannabis for over

209
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:24,639
20 years as an activist first and then

210
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:27,850
moving you know more into the industry

211
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,610
but you know as activists we were never

212
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,110
in a landscape that was friendly you

213
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,119
know and we were never in a landscape

214
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,278
that wasn't in crisis mode

215
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:38,769
we had dispensaries getting raided every

216
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,509
day we had patients going to jail

217
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:43,089
we had people you know losing their

218
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:46,839
freedom so the idea of having to operate

219
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:48,939
in a crisis scenario honestly feels a

220
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,379
little bit more comfortable to me than

221
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:54,818
operating in a business-as-usual

222
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:57,459
scenario and so I think you know we as

223
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:59,769
activists and as those who really had to

224
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:01,479
push this movement forward we

225
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:03,399
an opportunity to think about what used

226
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,769
to work and what we used to do before we

227
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,409
just tried to go about it as business as

228
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:10,659
usual and how do we change hearts and

229
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:13,238
minds and how do we ignite passion and

230
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:15,278
how do we help everyone understand the

231
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:17,499
hypocrisy between being essential and

232
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,970
being illegal and this is giving us

233
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:21,759
opportunities we haven't had and

234
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,100
actually quite some time so I'm

235
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,989
interested to take advantage of them and

236
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,089
also kind of use this as a pivot point

237
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:30,459
to see where we want to go moving

238
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:33,279
forward and I've got more thoughts on

239
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:35,438
that in terms of how the state of

240
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,088
California is handling cannabis how the

241
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:39,278
federal government is handling cannabis

242
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:42,279
and what we can do as business as an

243
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,828
activist to try to impact change even in

244
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:46,629
a time of kovat you know I kind of think

245
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:48,698
of this as like getting the carpet out

246
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:51,249
and like shaking it out real good you

247
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:52,868
know for society and when that happens

248
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:54,639
you have an opportunity to slough off a

249
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:56,170
lot of the crap that's been hanging on

250
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,600
for a long time and to breathe some

251
00:11:56,169 --> 00:12:00,458
fresh air into that and I think that

252
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,110
that's an amazing opportunity so I look

253
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,338
forward to having this conversation with

254
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,100
this miss Burt today

255
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:10,689
Thanks wow it's like a panel of a real

256
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,798
activist so Adam weigh-in hey thank you

257
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,349
for having me

258
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:16,259
so Adam Spiker I'm the executive

259
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,639
director Southern California Coalition

260
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:21,928
which has been in existence for about

261
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,509
five years now four and a half

262
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:30,308
predominantly initially to you know try

263
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:33,850
and you know fix LA's situation shall we

264
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:37,899
call it previously and currently I also

265
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:39,399
run a lobbying firm that has been in

266
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:42,249
existence in the state for three

267
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,499
generations definitely concur with some

268
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:47,230
of the things that I'm hearing from you

269
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:51,220
know the rest of your you know your

270
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,860
panelists I would say it's a shame that

271
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,959
it isn't hyperbole how you titled your

272
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,269
you know your conversation today

273
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:02,219
it's just flat-out not hyperbole that

274
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:05,739
that the industry is you know failing

275
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,589
and I would almost argue that the legal

276
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:10,389
industry just about has failed I mean

277
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:12,639
we're two and a half years in just about

278
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,480
we still have 70 to 80 percent of the

279
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,419
industry ally

280
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,159
and there's absolutely I would challenge

281
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:20,860
anyone to give me an example of another

282
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:23,469
regulated industry anywhere in the state

283
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,480
or country that has that type of

284
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,120
environment they're dealing with where

285
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,460
they're getting taxed and you know and

286
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,429
you're dealing with the over-regulation

287
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,750
and the costs associated and meanwhile

288
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:37,049
seventy to eighty percent of their

289
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:41,080
competition is still in existence

290
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:43,599
dominating their market so what we try

291
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,770
to do is you know we try to think

292
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,159
outside the box

293
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:51,129
continuously understanding politicians

294
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:54,219
whether local state federal you know

295
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:56,860
there's certainly tactics involved in in

296
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,540
how to you know create consensus and a

297
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,629
lot of times it means getting creative

298
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:05,319
and that's kind of been our you know our

299
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:07,840
mo from day one and it still is you know

300
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,020
as you know some of the the focal points

301
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,940
about I I don't have an answer for for

302
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:16,600
more licenses because the state really

303
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:18,130
can't they can't force that issue you

304
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,790
know because of our to two-tiered

305
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:23,470
structure you know on taxation you know

306
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:25,689
I'll just kind of start off a

307
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,509
conversation and Greg and others can can

308
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:31,540
chime in you know our challenge on

309
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:35,649
taxation has been for three years since

310
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:37,149
this Sieben became a concept of 64 the

311
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,970
the folks that were trying to do it

312
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:42,850
right and do it legally we're facing an

313
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:45,100
unfair competition and each year the

314
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,050
industry would get behind you know

315
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,290
typically you know Assemblymember Bonta

316
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:53,319
or others proposing ways to try and make

317
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:56,079
them more competitive and it just hasn't

318
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,870
even begun to got traction you know in

319
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,759
the legislature and unfortunately a lot

320
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,299
of the reasoning behind that is branding

321
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,700
it's been deemed corporate tax relief

322
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:09,009
it's you know the example I would give

323
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,950
is it's basically try it's basically

324
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:14,139
having you know med men harvest key

325
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,370
relief and acreage you know telling the

326
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:17,980
state we need help

327
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,230
meanwhile the state was seeing them

328
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,870
you'll be evaluated over a billion

329
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:26,139
dollars and so it was a universal no and

330
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,220
so one of our big pushes is to change

331
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:30,039
the narrative right

332
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:33,040
to this being a social responsibility of

333
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:35,139
the state you know we're all working

334
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,829
hard in our different local communities

335
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:41,379
to you know try and try and correct some

336
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,540
of the wrongs over the last 60 years as

337
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:46,840
it relates to the war on drugs you know

338
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:49,000
social equity programs and you know our

339
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,980
argument and our challenge to the state

340
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,019
is that it's a social responsibility to

341
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,450
them to make this industry more

342
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,759
competitive you know at least for those

343
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,450
programs let alone the general legal

344
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,830
industry or else they're set up to fail

345
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:05,110
and so that's where we're trying to

346
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,870
change the narrative and and also trying

347
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:11,139
to build more consensus within the

348
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,570
industry because a lot of times it it

349
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:15,370
gets really fractured and you know

350
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,770
different groups and different segments

351
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:21,279
go at you know policy at you know

352
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:24,100
advocacy you know in their own way and

353
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,850
sometimes it it does more harm than good

354
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:30,190
when you're not singing the same song

355
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:33,430
and so that that's kind of our argument

356
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,720
so we've you know we spent a lot of time

357
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:37,779
because we had our hands full just

358
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,120
dealing with LA we still do but we felt

359
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,789
it important to kind of try and you know

360
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,639
take a you know you know a second line

361
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:47,469
of of battle with with the state of

362
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,779
California as it relates to just the

363
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,190
competitive landscape for the legal

364
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:53,529
operators and the social equity

365
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:56,170
applicants and operators that are going

366
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:58,839
to enter this market that you know

367
00:16:56,169 --> 00:17:00,729
unless something change the statistics

368
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,500
are not going to lie they're going to

369
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:09,039
fail at an alarming rate and it won't be

370
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:16,088
their fault great you want to sort of

371
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:18,609
pick up this why not I mean you know

372
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:22,179
what everybody's saying is correct and

373
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:25,779
you know you don't have to look into the

374
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:28,449
future to see that most of the

375
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:31,029
businesses that are coming in half are

376
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:35,320
gonna fail all you have to do is look at

377
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:36,910
LA cities oh I mean I just don't jump

378
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,059
right into I'm for those that don't know

379
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,080
me I'm Greg CEO refinery Inc we're

380
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,329
licensed in both

381
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:49,210
phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 in LA and

382
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:51,038
been involved local la boy born and

383
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:55,990
raised been involved in the cannabis

384
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:58,538
politics since the beginning from glocca

385
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:03,339
nam andhe also on the board of the SE

386
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:05,500
c-- since the beginning and that's just

387
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:09,398
a quick brief one I'm also a Marine

388
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:13,058
combat veteran and so to get into that

389
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:17,199
right you don't have to look but la

390
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:20,500
phase two social equity a licensees to

391
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:24,490
see that it's failing you had 800

392
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,769
something different people awarded

393
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:29,740
licenses to life half and those are

394
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:31,359
already abandoned cancelled gone they

395
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,859
didn't have the funds they didn't have

396
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,099
the means they're gone

397
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:39,849
those were 400 licenses that were issued

398
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:43,689
by local and state that are now dead so

399
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:46,359
it's kind of gonna be hard in my opinion

400
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:49,570
to convince the state to give more when

401
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:52,869
they gave more and then they just went

402
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:55,950
to nothing so the focus should be I

403
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:59,678
believe more than giving more licenses

404
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:02,470
to help people succeed and not lose

405
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,759
those licenses because that is what's

406
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:10,569
happening and in my opinion I mean the

407
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:12,548
taxes are high everything is high you're

408
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:15,250
gonna keep the taxes high then you need

409
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:18,220
to subsidize cannabis and what I mean by

410
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:21,490
that is subsidize the price difference

411
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:23,919
between legal and illegal cannabis so

412
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,528
that we can be competitive against the

413
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,500
illegal market and part of the reason

414
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:31,028
why and it's not a excuse because it and

415
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,089
people need to pay their bills right

416
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:36,429
just like anything else and this is a

417
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:40,288
touching because I think I heard briefly

418
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:42,730
what Jaclyn was saying about retailers

419
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:46,569
bouncing from distro to distro and

420
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:51,220
basically bouncing on their bills right

421
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:54,970
and so peep these retailers are used to

422
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:57,220
this different

423
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,798
situation where they just get a item and

424
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,079
they double the price or they put a 80

425
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:04,839
percent markup on it and they think oh

426
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,089
I'm gonna make all my costs and then

427
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:09,480
here we are two years later and a lot of

428
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:11,949
the retailers like I'm gonna go bankrupt

429
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,589
so not only do they not have enough

430
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,409
money to pay their taxes which are

431
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:20,558
overpriced and then on top of that when

432
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:23,710
they're paying their taxes the state has

433
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,928
this ridiculous tax where you get hit

434
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,269
with 50% if you're even late on your

435
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:32,350
excise tax I've never heard of any

436
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:34,000
industry that gets 50% penalty you know

437
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:36,399
you have a hundred thousand dollar bill

438
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,630
Nelson it's a hundred fifty you couldn't

439
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,730
pay the hundred how are you gonna pay

440
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:46,270
the 150 you know so it's it's all

441
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:48,460
connected it's not just one issue one

442
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:50,679
problem it's a bunch of issues it's a

443
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,860
bunch of problems that have to all get

444
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:59,740
solved pretty much at the same time or

445
00:20:53,859 --> 00:21:02,529
else it's not gonna work a great can you

446
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,700
talk for a second about you it told me

447
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:10,690
that the taxes are so fucked up that

448
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:15,730
you're disincentivized from selling your

449
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:20,500
own homegrown product in retail you're

450
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:23,110
incentivized to sell it bulk yeah so the

451
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,500
tax liability on distribution is a lot

452
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:28,839
less right and my situation is maybe a

453
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:33,369
little different because we're a micro

454
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:37,119
business right and so I have to remit my

455
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:40,869
excise tax at the end not at the

456
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:44,288
beginning so what happens is I don't end

457
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:46,989
up paying an excise tax on 80% markup

458
00:21:44,288 --> 00:21:51,369
because I've done the math and eighty

459
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:53,169
percent markup means bankruptcy so you

460
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:55,089
know I have payroll taxes I have all

461
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:58,750
these other taxes that we haven't even

462
00:21:55,089 --> 00:22:06,490
got into as a normal retail would and

463
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:09,159
and so god I just went off track and

464
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,358
anyone else can weigh in if you have

465
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,599
something to say about this but you were

466
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:18,398
talking about the bulk as opposed yeah

467
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:21,398
so for me it you just I pay less on

468
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:24,638
taxes and end up profiting more money

469
00:22:21,398 --> 00:22:28,058
when I just sell my cultivation in bulk

470
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:30,908
instead of spending the time the package

471
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:34,989
it lab test it put it through the retail

472
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:37,210
and then pay full excise tax at the

473
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:42,429
point of sale which sometimes I'm doing

474
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:45,639
it 225 percent markup you know so the

475
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:48,519
whole system is very it's wrong because

476
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:50,738
you have some people paying less taxes

477
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:52,960
than others and then there are people

478
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:55,358
that are working the system you know

479
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,970
saying oh yeah I'm gonna remit my own

480
00:22:55,358 --> 00:22:59,858
taxes and then they never remit any

481
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:03,608
excise taxes because they're doing

482
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:07,418
distro to distro and the state hasn't

483
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:10,749
and the city have not caught up to Ted

484
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:14,169
yet and so there's people out there that

485
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:17,288
are avoiding taxes you know on the

486
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:19,419
excise side and claiming that they paid

487
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:20,769
when they didn't pay and eventually

488
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:23,889
that's going to come back onto the

489
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:26,229
distributor as well you know and then

490
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:28,988
there will be a dispute of who paid who

491
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:31,239
didn't pay so there is there's even more

492
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:33,308
problems coming down the line and those

493
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:34,808
that's gonna be huge is that one you're

494
00:23:33,308 --> 00:23:37,839
talking about millions and millions of

495
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:40,118
dollars I mean just in excise tax alone

496
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,509
we pay over two and a half million a

497
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:44,079
year

498
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:47,470
I mean excise and sales tax not not just

499
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:50,158
exercise to the state so you know your

500
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:55,649
that's a lot of money that people are

501
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,649
you know basically frauding this data I

502
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:01,778
think we're in the tax war story section

503
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:11,069
part of our discussion anyone else want

504
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:13,960
to weigh in on this a Tom this is Adam

505
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:16,720
this is a definitely a pet peeve of mine

506
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,450
and I think it's a pet peeve of the you

507
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,058
know the legal industries in general I

508
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,509
think maybe for your viewers or

509
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:25,639
listeners

510
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:28,519
maybe an analogy might be appropriate

511
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,960
and while I totally appreciate it and

512
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,049
can understand the legal cannabis

513
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,380
industry doesn't like you no comparisons

514
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:40,339
to legal alcohol what I do think is an

515
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:43,310
interesting you know perception of what

516
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:46,789
happened you know post prohibition of

517
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:48,859
alcohol in 1932 we lifted prohibition

518
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:52,730
and you know because of supply and

519
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:55,099
demand alcohol was this robust industry

520
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:58,460
all underground unregulated unprotected

521
00:24:55,099 --> 00:25:02,959
so we lift prohibition in 1932 and the

522
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:06,620
first federal tax in 1933 on alcohol was

523
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,700
2% because they were trying to

524
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:12,439
transition that robust legal industry

525
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,690
into regulated means and it worked

526
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,430
obviously it took some time and they

527
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,390
staggered the tax rate I think they went

528
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:22,640
from 2 to 6 to 13 to probably 3,000

529
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,980
right now who the hell knows but the

530
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,070
point is it doesn't matter what the tax

531
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:31,420
rate now is on legal alcohol they

532
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:35,119
eradicated the illicit competition they

533
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:38,090
staged up the taxation and made sure

534
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:41,269
that they were capturing this new legal

535
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:43,459
market of legal alcohol again you know

536
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:46,160
through you know regulated means and

537
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:49,039
channels we've not done that in cannabis

538
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,600
you know and in California and a lot of

539
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,339
you know I know Jackie is bringing up

540
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:54,379
your reporters out there that are trying

541
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:57,049
to capture the story in the essence of

542
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:00,260
what's going on there's no other example

543
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:02,619
that exists in the world like California

544
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:05,629
where we had a twenty plus year history

545
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:07,279
under compassionate use to create

546
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,620
collective models and medical

547
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,579
protections for patients and consumers

548
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:16,519
and and coops that turned into a

549
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:19,789
multi-billion dollar industry and so in

550
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,680
California like it's basically the

551
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:25,099
analogy I like to use is that you know

552
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,500
Colorado Yosh you know Illinois some of

553
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:29,959
these other states or canada and in a

554
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,789
large sense they got to you they got to

555
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,590
play with a blank chessboard and figure

556
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:35,559
out what to do with legal cannabis and

557
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:36,849
they still had their challenges

558
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:41,559
california we

559
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:44,109
prop 64 you know predating that the MC

560
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,480
RSA and then mal curse' eventually and

561
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:48,159
we started with a chessboard where

562
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,470
pieces were all over the goddamn place

563
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,410
and no one can figure out what to do and

564
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,690
our argument was always in Gregg was was

565
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,060
part of this from the beginning you just

566
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:00,580
need to incentivize the illicit folks to

567
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:03,159
come out of that of that gray area and

568
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:06,669
into legal in whatever way possible we

569
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,500
proposed registries you know checks and

570
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,120
balances within those registries but

571
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,309
just get people to come out of the

572
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:14,859
shadows and start being on the right

573
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:17,440
side of legal and we've never done that

574
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:19,479
and now we're two and a half years in

575
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,600
we've created this price point

576
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,329
disparagement that's so severe that and

577
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,949
Greg can speak to some sure others they

578
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:28,509
all had friends that were playing in

579
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,400
that gray market you know in the

580
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:33,039
collective model and a lot of their

581
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,680
friends said good luck to you but I'm

582
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,170
not going there because what's in it for

583
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,850
me you know I'm gonna lose money I don't

584
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:42,490
think I'm ever gonna get caught doing

585
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:44,919
what I'm doing which is now completely

586
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:48,460
illegal they just take their chances and

587
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:50,470
a part of this discussion definitely has

588
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:53,440
to be enforcement and in particular

589
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:56,769
deterrence for you know for illicit

590
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,799
activity right now we have none most of

591
00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:03,099
most of any sort of felony charges or

592
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:06,430
prosecution were taken away under Prop

593
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:09,069
64 and I think at that time you know

594
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:11,049
certainly you're giving sympathy to the

595
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:15,490
war on drugs you can understand the

596
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:18,250
logic but now post Prop 64 and licensing

597
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:20,529
for the legal industry we're making

598
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:24,369
clear distinction between legal and

599
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:26,049
illegal yet we have no deterrence for

600
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:29,559
the illicit operator to think twice

601
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:32,680
about starting a legal cannabis business

602
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:34,779
and basically it's become a it's a line

603
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,289
item in their budget you know in LA

604
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:40,299
we're playing whack-a-mole every day and

605
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:42,039
to bring up la not you know obviously

606
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:45,549
you know you have a broader audience in

607
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:47,529
that but la sets the tone for the whole

608
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:50,419
state's market because of how big it is

609
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:52,579
and in LA

610
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:55,370
and others like him can't compete

611
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:57,559
because you know while the city's trying

612
00:28:55,369 --> 00:29:01,429
their best to enforce and shut down a

613
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:04,009
lot of illegal stores and they just they

614
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:07,220
just finalized a padlocking order in the

615
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:09,769
city to be able to close down illegal

616
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,750
stores they still find a way to open

617
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:13,879
back up sometimes they'll open back up

618
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,980
in the same strip mall you know in a

619
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,600
newt and a new address but 40 feet away

620
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,569
and you've got to start the whole

621
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,399
process over again and I and I think

622
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:25,299
it's just got to be critical to the

623
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:28,550
discussion that there's no deterrence

624
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:30,529
for illegal operators they're not afraid

625
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:34,789
to keep doing what they're doing because

626
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:37,160
the client tells their and the it's a

627
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:42,430
risk/reward thing the risk is very

628
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:42,430
minimal for them and that's a problem

629
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:53,180
when I just weigh in what's the best way

630
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:55,840
to write this imbalance is it is it

631
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,990
enforcement which is the stick or

632
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:00,500
carrots

633
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:02,750
what reducing taxes incentivizing

634
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:08,210
patients and consumers to come back to

635
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:10,789
the legal market what what and how do we

636
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:14,019
get there what's happening in Sacramento

637
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:18,200
are they just simply not listening

638
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:20,359
so anyway yeah so I mean honestly I

639
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,150
don't I don't think enforcement ever

640
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:26,089
really is gonna work we have way too

641
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:28,190
many hidden places in Los Angeles and

642
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:30,980
way too many people for them to find

643
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:34,730
everyone and beyond the whack-a-mole I

644
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:37,250
had an illegal retailer maybe a thousand

645
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:40,700
feet from me it took gangs of narcotics

646
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:43,430
seven times raiding him and then finally

647
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:46,190
the last time the idiot decided to run

648
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,870
up the street with a bag full of cash so

649
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,900
they got him on some other charges not

650
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:53,719
even cannabis and then that's what

651
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:56,000
finally closed him but yeah and I have

652
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,610
friends you know I've a lot of friends

653
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,319
that are still in the illegal market

654
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:03,559
because there's no more gray area now

655
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,009
and they have no intention of coming in

656
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,619
and

657
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:11,779
call me the idiot for paying all this

658
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:21,469
money in taxes and while I'm suffering I

659
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:26,899
think they're right you know I mean I

660
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:28,759
probably invested in real estate hey Tom

661
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,650
I would just say this that definitely

662
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:33,500
turned over the others I don't think

663
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:36,170
there's a silver bullet in my opinion

664
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,089
just fixing taxes especially

665
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:41,180
understanding the landscape of how

666
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:42,829
difficult is been to get any sort of tax

667
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,529
relief the last couple of years of the

668
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:47,539
state is gonna change the problem I do

669
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:49,099
certainly sympathize with Greg and

670
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:53,269
understand where he's talking about from

671
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:55,279
an actual enforcement standpoint you

672
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:57,410
know illegal operators have been pretty

673
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,690
damn good at hiding for 20-plus years if

674
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,460
not more and and they have a lot of

675
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:05,570
confidence that they won't get caught

676
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:07,610
I do think more deterrence is key I mean

677
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:10,519
going after the land landlords that

678
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:12,219
safe-harbor these folks you know doing

679
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,139
things like that and having more

680
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:18,380
administrative enforcement rather than

681
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,840
boots on the ground enforcement you know

682
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,360
is a help you know like the you know

683
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:25,730
Reggie jones-sawyer and assembly member

684
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,740
brew Bo both have bills in the

685
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,620
legislature that may not go anywhere

686
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:33,319
this year because of Copan 19and and

687
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:36,529
Reggie's bill is to go after landlords

688
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:38,869
to the tune of $50,000 a day if they're

689
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:41,990
having an illegal cannabis operator in

690
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:44,599
one of their premises Rubio's bill is to

691
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:48,799
go after the operator to the tune of

692
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:51,619
$30,000 a day and Greg was there you

693
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,720
know from the beginning in LA we tried

694
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:56,599
to fight for as much enforcement under

695
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,000
Prop M as possible and we settled on

696
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:01,549
trying to do $20,000 a day fines

697
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,339
attached to the landlord and the

698
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:06,349
operator if they were caught thinking it

699
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:08,359
was more of an administrative action and

700
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:10,639
that we can send letters in the city

701
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:12,889
attorney can start you know enforcing

702
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,980
and adjudicating and then we come to

703
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,270
find out they can't enforce it you know

704
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,990
they don't think the city attorney

705
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:20,750
doesn't think

706
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:23,750
can win those those battles in court to

707
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,819
charge people 20,000 a day and you know

708
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,460
we're sitting there looking back at it

709
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:30,230
you know now saying well why the fuck

710
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:32,120
did you write it into the ordinance you

711
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:34,940
know and into the initiative if you

712
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:37,819
didn't think you can add force it but I

713
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:40,160
do think enforcement's key I do think

714
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:42,950
more licensing is key and I agree with

715
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,660
Greg you know there's you know there's a

716
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,640
lot of licenses out there I think

717
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,190
there's an overabundance of cultivation

718
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,470
licenses but when it comes to a safe

719
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,720
access standpoint you can get into

720
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:56,390
pockets of the state or you might have

721
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,390
to go 75 miles just to get to a licensed

722
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,910
retailer and so it does matter in that

723
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:04,360
regard because the illicit market will

724
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:07,970
follow where the clientele is gonna be

725
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:10,909
so I'll just leave it at that jet just

726
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,320
quickly I'm a big fan of concrete

727
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:15,530
examples

728
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,360
so Greg touched on kind of the craziness

729
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:21,080
that is taxes from the retailer

730
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:23,570
perspective Shannon you wear two hats

731
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,759
distributor and brand I'm sure flow kana

732
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:28,700
has a distribution license too and is

733
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,629
also a brand so can you guys just talk

734
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:34,279
about some of the crazy stuff of how

735
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:36,159
you're taxed from a brand and

736
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,200
distributor perspective and then Jackie

737
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,539
you're in Sacramento so can you talk

738
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,638
about that the tax conversations you're

739
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:45,858
having with the Laurie Ajax's Nicole

740
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:49,700
Elliot's Fiona Maas of the world and

741
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:50,259
kind of what they're where their heads

742
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:54,888
are at

743
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:57,800
that's actually not my lane I spent time

744
00:34:54,889 --> 00:35:00,289
at K Street or K Street had dedicated

745
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,500
lobbyists working on those issues and

746
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:05,630
I'm no longer with K Street but I did

747
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:09,800
want to touch on enforcement and then

748
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:12,619
I'll let Shannon and a man to talk about

749
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,100
the taxes at those levels that they're

750
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:19,608
experiencing I can't stand when we have

751
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:24,858
any conversation about enforcement where

752
00:35:19,608 --> 00:35:27,829
operators are asking for increased you

753
00:35:24,858 --> 00:35:30,559
know law enforcement presence because

754
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:32,409
that didn't work for for 20 years under

755
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:38,358
prop 215 when

756
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:40,670
commercial activity was illegal and it

757
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:43,250
was a felony and so now it's a

758
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:47,088
misdemeanor and we're still expecting

759
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:50,539
we're expecting a letter offense to work

760
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:53,358
to prohibit on the illegal market from

761
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:57,529
existing in flourishing and I think

762
00:35:53,358 --> 00:36:00,889
that's the wrong approach I know that in

763
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:03,769
the prop 215 days that dispensaries were

764
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:07,759
paying sales tax and I don't believe

765
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:10,849
that that ever stopped and so if the the

766
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,690
old BOE which is now the CDT FA is

767
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:18,230
knocking on illegal dispensaries doors

768
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,639
and demanding tax payment is that not

769
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:23,329
the definition of taxation without

770
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:26,058
representation and if they're painting

771
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:29,240
those taxes still currently and they're

772
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:31,400
illegal why can't we tax them more and

773
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:33,858
even the playing field it is the only

774
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:37,608
way that the legal market will ever

775
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:41,150
thrive is if we can bring these two into

776
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:45,380
alignment you know and and then let the

777
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:49,010
consumer decide you know I love to I'm

778
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:51,318
in Florida right now and I love getting

779
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:54,319
into a new area you know typically I do

780
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:56,358
this in California but I'm in Florida so

781
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:59,449
I did it here and I went to a city

782
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:01,219
council meeting two days ago where a ban

783
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:04,460
was on the agenda and I just wanted to

784
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:06,858
see like you know another state how they

785
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:10,490
were having this conversation but on I

786
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:12,769
have been asking about the illicit

787
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:16,039
market to anybody that will talk to me

788
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:17,719
here and and whether or not they

789
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:19,308
purchase in the illicit market and if

790
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:22,009
they purchase in the legal market as

791
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:24,950
well and you know the illicit market

792
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:29,540
here is is even bigger than than I had

793
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:31,189
ever dreamed because you know I talked

794
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:34,699
to one girl and she loves the

795
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:36,318
dispensaries here but even without taxes

796
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:41,328
those dispensaries are charging fifty

797
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:44,000
five dollars an eighth and the girl that

798
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:45,380
that I had asked about her purchases in

799
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,588
the illegal market

800
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:51,680
she said she gets hers directly from a

801
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:53,808
licensed operator out of Washington

802
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:58,149
state mails it directly to her and she

803
00:37:53,809 --> 00:38:02,778
can get an ounce for $200 and so if our

804
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:05,809
legal market has their their paws all up

805
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:08,869
in the illicit market and is now going

806
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:11,778
direct to consumer across the country

807
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:14,150
like we're in trouble and so we need to

808
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:16,130
be thinking along those lines what is

809
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,858
the illness at market doing how are

810
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:20,630
consumers purchasing their their product

811
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:22,940
what are they getting what are they

812
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:25,759
getting it for and how can we compete

813
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,920
and that's that's the conversation that

814
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:30,019
has to be had that is the only way

815
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,099
they'll eat the legal market across the

816
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:35,508
country is ever going to thrive is if

817
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:37,548
we're actually having the honest

818
00:38:35,509 --> 00:38:40,039
conversation about what a consumer is

819
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:42,588
getting for their dollar we've never had

820
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:46,160
that conversation and it boggles my mind

821
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:51,619
how we never took a consumer into the

822
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:54,348
picture Greg and I just wanna touch on

823
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:59,059
what Jackie said some things I agree

824
00:38:54,349 --> 00:39:03,019
some things I don't so but as far as for

825
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:04,190
the taxes majority supermajority I'm not

826
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:06,108
gonna say all because there might

827
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:09,559
despise some people that are paying but

828
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:11,538
I could say 99% of retailers illegal

829
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:15,589
retailers here are paying zero tax sale

830
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:17,180
tax zero and I believe that the CDT FA

831
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:20,449
should go after them for tax evasion

832
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:22,578
just like any other business and just

833
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:25,038
like they did to Al Capone you cannot

834
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:26,869
you have no defense against tax evasion

835
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,880
and if you're not paying the state in

836
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:29,420
our government taxes and I hope you rot

837
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,940
in jail

838
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:34,130
that's my feelings because I pay lots of

839
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:37,249
taxes and if that's how you want to be

840
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:40,818
whether legal or illegal you you should

841
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:43,429
go to jail not for cannabis because I I

842
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:47,838
have my home you know I got charged with

843
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:49,548
triple felony in 2007 for just 55 grams

844
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,139
of cannabis so I really don't like

845
00:39:49,548 --> 00:39:53,239
seeing anybody going to jail just

846
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,670
because of cannabis but if you're not

847
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:57,978
paying your taxes and you're doing other

848
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,119
things wrong then yeah you should and

849
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,828
that's an easy

850
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,420
ace and I don't know why they haven't

851
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:07,130
done more of that because there is no

852
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:10,338
defense for that and then as far as

853
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:14,150
legal people going direct to market in

854
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:16,038
another state I would not believe the

855
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:18,499
consumer and what she's saying because

856
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,839
there's so many fraudulent products out

857
00:40:18,498 --> 00:40:22,399
there where they're making counterfeits

858
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:24,619
of other people and I could be an

859
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,509
illegal person and Washington is very an

860
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:28,220
Oregon they are probably well Washington

861
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:29,838
Oregon California we are the worst we

862
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:33,588
send so much stuff out of state it's

863
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:35,480
ridiculous and and you know anyone could

864
00:40:33,588 --> 00:40:38,028
say oh yeah it's a legal product I

865
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,588
ordered some you know I could order brat

866
00:40:38,028 --> 00:40:41,989
little I don't know about now doing Co

867
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:43,969
bid but you know I could have ordered

868
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:45,199
brassknuckles packaging in parts and

869
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:47,449
filled it up and said yeah it's brass

870
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:50,509
knuckles and send it across the country

871
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:53,868
you know a lot of brands are having

872
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:56,079
serious issues with that and getting and

873
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:59,028
that sent to the point of where you said

874
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,430
Jackie what is the consumer getting for

875
00:40:59,028 --> 00:41:04,400
their dollar well in the illegal market

876
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:07,129
they're getting illegal products that

877
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,798
are not lab tested and could be severely

878
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:12,440
bad for their health especially during

879
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:16,788
the time of Ovid where we know that

880
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:19,420
people with breathing problems can are

881
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:22,519
more susceptible and can die and

882
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:24,528
pesticides you know I don't know people

883
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:26,929
don't realize pesticide is a nerve agent

884
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:31,248
and it actually lowers your white blood

885
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:33,919
cell count which makes it you know hello

886
00:41:31,248 --> 00:41:35,868
you're gonna die even easier now so that

887
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,630
that's a very important point but that

888
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:40,999
gets into the educating and I believe we

889
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:44,119
need the state and not states all the

890
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:47,689
states that are legal to do a education

891
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:49,190
program to educate to do more to educate

892
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:52,249
the consumers like look you might be

893
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:54,559
saving a couple of bucks getting you

894
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:57,649
from the street but is your life worth

895
00:41:54,559 --> 00:42:00,079
it is it worth it to risk your health

896
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:03,528
and well-being just to save a few bucks

897
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,210
you know and and it has to but that's

898
00:42:03,528 --> 00:42:07,248
where that difference has to come in

899
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:09,380
right if it's a fifty dollar difference

900
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:11,838
where you're paying double the price the

901
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,920
consumer is gonna definitely risk it but

902
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,529
if we could get that

903
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,809
to be very close to where it's only a

904
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:20,690
few dollar difference then then they

905
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:22,789
probably wouldn't risk yeah well a lot

906
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:25,010
of consumers they don't even know

907
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:27,500
they're going into illegal shops I mean

908
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:30,680
we talked about it in the industry and

909
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:33,619
we can all list illegal the you know

910
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:35,599
unregulated shops around us but your

911
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:37,219
average consumer all they know is they

912
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,750
drove by a building with a green cross

913
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:41,929
in the window and they went and got a

914
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:44,179
great deal on product you know the BCC

915
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:46,460
sent out those QR codes for people to

916
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:48,799
scan I don't know anyone that's ever

917
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,860
walked in and looked for the QR code to

918
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,060
verify that they're an illegal shot you

919
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,760
know so we've got to get that

920
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:58,369
conversation outside of the industry in

921
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,470
to the average consumer so that they

922
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:02,859
have to know that they have the choice

923
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:05,599
of purchasing regulated or unregulated

924
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:08,690
but you know the bottom line is we've

925
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,699
got to simplify the amount of compliance

926
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:14,929
in this industry and we've got to

927
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:17,349
simplify taxes as a distributor I'm

928
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:19,789
playing taxman for retailers and

929
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:22,130
cultivators I'm not responsible for

930
00:43:19,789 --> 00:43:24,679
taxes but I'm responsible for collecting

931
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:26,869
taxes and then remitting and that's just

932
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:28,879
that's absurd there's no other industry

933
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:32,569
where someone's paying taxes on behalf

934
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,760
of someone else's business I just wanted

935
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:37,130
to say something important before I

936
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,590
forget because and I and if you're the

937
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:42,740
only distributors notice they tax us on

938
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:45,320
the excise tax they count the excise tax

939
00:43:42,739 --> 00:43:49,729
that we're collecting from the retailer

940
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:51,620
you know uh they tax that tax so it's

941
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,829
really not in the benefit of the

942
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:57,259
distributor to collect and remit because

943
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:59,210
we're getting on a attacks that we're

944
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:08,890
not even making money off of we're doing

945
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:08,889
a service right it's insane

946
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,170
yeah and then he only just the

947
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:17,150
compliance side of it as the other

948
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:19,789
reason the regulated markets really

949
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:21,889
struggling if you think about the old

950
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:23,108
days you were a cultivator you have a

951
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:25,690
few plants and you

952
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:28,150
back yard or in your basement you trim

953
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:30,009
them at your kitchen table you put them

954
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:32,289
in a backpack and you went to the

955
00:44:30,009 --> 00:44:34,239
retailer you know you were it was one

956
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:37,089
set of hands touching it throughout the

957
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,739
process on one piece of property now

958
00:44:37,088 --> 00:44:40,599
we've got you know all of the

959
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:42,909
regulations for setting up a farm

960
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:45,640
getting permitted staying compliant with

961
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:47,318
Canada you know with cultivation you've

962
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:48,759
got to have a band you've got to have

963
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:50,588
someone that knows metric on the

964
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:52,719
cultivation side someone that knows

965
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:56,108
metric on the distribution side we're

966
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:58,209
inventory the stuff twice a month so you

967
00:44:56,108 --> 00:45:00,219
know we're paying that overhead then

968
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,769
we've got to have somebody that note you

969
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:05,078
know metric and pulling it out putting

970
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:09,818
it on another band trying to schedule to

971
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:12,400
get into retailers and with copepod

972
00:45:09,818 --> 00:45:14,380
coming on retailers have limited hours

973
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,608
now so you know we were doing deliveries

974
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,920
five days a week

975
00:45:15,608 --> 00:45:20,828
now most shops are taking deliveries

976
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,048
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and so we're

977
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:24,940
having to put more vehicles more people

978
00:45:23,048 --> 00:45:27,460
on the road to get there between ten and

979
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:31,028
four three days a week where previously

980
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:34,088
it was you know eight to six five days a

981
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:36,429
week there's there's a lot of things in

982
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:38,230
the supply chain that were already on

983
00:45:36,429 --> 00:45:42,308
the brink that are getting constricted

984
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:44,858
even further and we're gonna see a next

985
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:50,048
round of extinction I think happen in

986
00:45:44,858 --> 00:45:54,969
the next couple of months and you wanna

987
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:58,329
weigh in I'm sure I'm I can't really

988
00:45:54,969 --> 00:46:00,098
speak to the specifics of Taxation on

989
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:01,660
distribution because that's not my role

990
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:04,989
at the company I'm in Community

991
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:07,509
Development so I do a lot of policy work

992
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:09,608
and that policy is my background and not

993
00:46:07,509 --> 00:46:13,119
business so I will talk more about

994
00:46:09,608 --> 00:46:14,528
policy so we did have the LA o report

995
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,539
that came out last year which is the

996
00:46:14,528 --> 00:46:18,608
legislative analyst office that

997
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:19,778
basically looks at how the system is

998
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:22,568
working and then makes recommendations

999
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:24,608
about how they feel we can change the

1000
00:46:22,568 --> 00:46:26,139
regulations in order to bring what we're

1001
00:46:24,608 --> 00:46:29,528
seeing more in line with what the goals

1002
00:46:26,139 --> 00:46:31,179
of legalization were and one of the big

1003
00:46:29,528 --> 00:46:34,150
goals of legalization was to eliminate

1004
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:36,009
the unregulated marketplace so the LA o

1005
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,610
looks and sees how long are we doing

1006
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:38,440
that we're

1007
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:40,960
doing terrible at that as has already

1008
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,730
been discussed by other panelists one

1009
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,800
out of every four dollars spent on

1010
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:46,659
cannabis is being spent in the regulated

1011
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,490
market three out of every four dollars

1012
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:50,710
spent on cannabis in California is being

1013
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:52,899
spent on the unregulated market so

1014
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:55,059
obviously there's a huge disconnect as

1015
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:57,970
was mentioned part of this issue is that

1016
00:46:55,059 --> 00:47:00,730
we had a very robust gray market for 20

1017
00:46:57,969 --> 00:47:02,739
years to the point where in many ways it

1018
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:05,289
mimicked what the regulated market ended

1019
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:07,750
up looking like so unlike other states

1020
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:09,789
even states that had medical prior to

1021
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,369
Biegel ization which they all did they

1022
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:14,289
didn't have these gray market scenarios

1023
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:16,690
even Colorado had a very regulated

1024
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:18,130
medical cannabis program when they

1025
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,840
legalized so they already had a

1026
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:22,690
licensing structure in place they were

1027
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:25,090
licensing the entire supply chain folks

1028
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:26,320
may forget prior to legalization the

1029
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,090
only people of the state that had a

1030
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,490
license to do anything were a handful of

1031
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:32,350
dispensaries and even they risked

1032
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:34,989
federal interference and we're skating

1033
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:37,420
shut down so it was really not a stable

1034
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:38,679
environment for anyone you know now

1035
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,019
we're trying to bring some stability

1036
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:43,779
into it and I think with that we're

1037
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:45,280
constricting it so what the LA OS office

1038
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,320
recommended was that we eliminate the

1039
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,300
cultivation tax so that's something that

1040
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,760
absolutely impacts the folks that we

1041
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,100
work with no other crop has a separate

1042
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,170
tax associated with just the fact that

1043
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:58,179
you're growing the crop so that's a huge

1044
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:00,579
issue the second issue is the way that

1045
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:02,169
tax is collected so the cultivation tax

1046
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:04,449
as was mentioned is collected by the

1047
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:06,849
distributor but we have to collect that

1048
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:08,579
before we have any idea how that product

1049
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:10,900
is gonna perform in the marketplace so

1050
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:13,480
individuals are paying cultivation tax

1051
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,250
based on weight prior to the product

1052
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,019
actually getting into the marketplace to

1053
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,789
where we know whether that's gonna sell

1054
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:20,739
well whether it's not gonna sell well

1055
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:23,019
and that is completely unpredictable

1056
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:25,089
right now as to you know what's gonna go

1057
00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:27,099
on dispensary shelves what's gonna sell

1058
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:29,079
what's not gonna sell so it makes it

1059
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:31,329
really difficult especially for smaller

1060
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:33,460
cultivators to be able to have any kind

1061
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:35,139
of assurance of their economics and how

1062
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:37,059
things are gonna work and how much they

1063
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:39,609
need to grow in order to pay the tax in

1064
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:41,739
order to sell this much it just doesn't

1065
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:44,110
make sense so I think eliminating the

1066
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:46,599
cultivation tax is a really good first

1067
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:47,620
step and then the second issue is about

1068
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:50,079
the excise tax

1069
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:51,909
so excise tax is sin tax

1070
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,949
it's attacks that we put on products

1071
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:55,750
that we think are gonna cause some kind

1072
00:48:53,949 --> 00:48:58,029
of public health or safety harm to the

1073
00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:00,099
community and we feel that that tax

1074
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:03,850
money is there in order to make up for

1075
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:06,789
that so for example tobacco tax alcohol

1076
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:08,230
tax the idea is that if you drink for 50

1077
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:10,630
years and end up in the hospital with

1078
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:12,579
cirrhosis of the liver and the society

1079
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:14,950
has to pay for those medical bills that

1080
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:18,130
that's supported by the excise tax that

1081
00:49:14,949 --> 00:49:20,199
people pay on alcohol so of course when

1082
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:22,450
we were legalizing cannabis there was a

1083
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:25,329
lot of comparisons being made to alcohol

1084
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:27,309
and unlike alcohol prohibition when it

1085
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:30,190
ended it hadn't been that long since

1086
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:32,289
we'd had legal alcohol so people getting

1087
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:35,110
back into legal alcohol after alcohol

1088
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:37,269
prohibition wasn't as jarring with

1089
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:39,400
cannabis we've had you know decades and

1090
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:41,320
decades and decades of prohibition so

1091
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,599
when we came and said all right now it's

1092
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,210
time to legalize folks were like well

1093
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,469
you got to have a syntax because

1094
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:50,110
legalization is gonna cause all of this

1095
00:49:47,469 --> 00:49:51,699
harm health harm and safety harm and bus

1096
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:53,320
drivers are gonna be smoking weed and

1097
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:55,059
your pilot's gonna be smoking weed and

1098
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,730
your teenagers gonna be smoking weed and

1099
00:49:55,059 --> 00:50:00,099
we need a hefty excise tax to make sure

1100
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:02,889
that society doesn't end up footing the

1101
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:04,599
bill for all of these harms of course

1102
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:05,949
those of us who study cannabis knew that

1103
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:07,750
was all bullshit and we knew there

1104
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:10,539
weren't gonna be these harms that we see

1105
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:12,639
with other substances but that was the

1106
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:14,590
thinking of folks who were making the

1107
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:17,769
rules I mean they felt cannabis needed

1108
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:19,870
an excise tax so last thing I'll say so

1109
00:50:17,769 --> 00:50:21,880
here we are with this excise tax the

1110
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:24,250
excise tax is being levied on the

1111
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,840
consumer the consumer that is currently

1112
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:28,090
spending three out of four dollars in

1113
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,850
the unregulated marketplace now the

1114
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:32,860
theory is that if you reduce taxes you

1115
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:34,719
make less revenue and that has been one

1116
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,720
of the reasons that the state has been

1117
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:39,189
very reticent to touch the excise tax

1118
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:41,439
especially right now given that we've

1119
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:43,360
pushed back tax filing in California

1120
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,980
till July so they're like we don't even

1121
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,660
know how much money we're gonna have how

1122
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,710
are we gonna cut excise tax so we don't

1123
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:50,199
even know how much money we're gonna

1124
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:51,789
have but see here's the rub and this is

1125
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:55,089
because we have this unregulated

1126
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:57,759
marketplace cutting excise tax may

1127
00:50:55,090 --> 00:51:00,880
reduce temporarily and in a very

1128
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:03,269
specific way the amount of tax that

1129
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,298
dispensaries were met because of that

1130
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:08,608
sighs amount however what it also does

1131
00:51:06,298 --> 00:51:10,409
is have people buy more product because

1132
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:12,958
it's cheaper and they're paying less for

1133
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:14,818
it people are going into regulated

1134
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:17,248
stores instead of unregulated stores

1135
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:19,619
because the price differential is more

1136
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:22,528
similar so in the end you actually end

1137
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:24,689
up making more money if you just reduce

1138
00:51:22,528 --> 00:51:27,059
that tax and bring more people into the

1139
00:51:24,688 --> 00:51:29,009
regulated marketplace so I think from a

1140
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:31,499
taxation perspective what we're really

1141
00:51:29,009 --> 00:51:34,739
advocating for is the elimination of the

1142
00:51:31,498 --> 00:51:37,828
cultivation tax and a hefty reduction of

1143
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:40,289
the excise tax at least for the next few

1144
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:42,149
years and then the other whole side of

1145
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:43,979
this is the fact that consumers don't

1146
00:51:42,148 --> 00:51:46,199
have a lot of money right now and so

1147
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:48,148
that's pushing them even more into the

1148
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:50,719
unregulated market which is even bigger

1149
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:52,978
reason for us to reduce the excise tax

1150
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:55,499
because on top of all the other public

1151
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:57,448
safety issues we had a volley and I know

1152
00:51:55,498 --> 00:51:59,548
that like that's all old news and people

1153
00:51:57,449 --> 00:52:02,188
are like oh Holly what's that but that's

1154
00:51:59,548 --> 00:52:04,469
the vaping illness right and so we know

1155
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:07,438
that a lot of those situations are tied

1156
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:09,479
to people buying unregulated products so

1157
00:52:07,438 --> 00:52:12,028
now that we have this lung illness of

1158
00:52:09,478 --> 00:52:14,308
COBIT going through the country are we

1159
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:16,168
really gonna keep prices so high in the

1160
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:18,089
regulated marketplace of an essential

1161
00:52:16,168 --> 00:52:20,848
business that we're pushing people to

1162
00:52:18,088 --> 00:52:22,528
buy unregulated vape carts which is just

1163
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:25,229
gonna increase the likelihood of lung

1164
00:52:22,528 --> 00:52:26,909
disease you know and people listen to

1165
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:28,588
this or like that makes no sense

1166
00:52:26,909 --> 00:52:31,648
and this is what the impact of

1167
00:52:28,588 --> 00:52:33,568
propaganda is this is the impact of 50

1168
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,308
years of trying to convince people that

1169
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:37,708
cannabis is evil that people that use

1170
00:52:35,309 --> 00:52:39,929
cannabis are evil because this is what

1171
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:43,168
it does it makes people completely

1172
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:44,999
reject logic it makes them not think

1173
00:52:43,168 --> 00:52:47,879
about business models it makes them

1174
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:49,498
react to how they feel so one of the

1175
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,778
things we should be doing as an industry

1176
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:54,328
really is going back to our activism

1177
00:52:51,778 --> 00:52:56,099
days when we were really really good at

1178
00:52:54,329 --> 00:52:58,619
changing hearts and minds and we were

1179
00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:02,009
really really good at making people feel

1180
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:03,630
a certain way about our mission and I

1181
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:05,489
feel like we've gotten away from that a

1182
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:07,079
little bit because we're trying to go

1183
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:08,759
about it legitimately and we're trying

1184
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:10,798
to lobby our legislators and we're

1185
00:53:08,759 --> 00:53:12,148
trying to form these relationships but

1186
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:13,528
we're not going into city council

1187
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:15,328
meetings anymore we're not going and

1188
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:17,159
talking about the fact that it's 75

1189
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:19,380
miles to a license

1190
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:21,058
sensory and how is grandma gonna get her

1191
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:23,010
meds like you don't talk about that

1192
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:24,990
anymore and I feel like it's done us a

1193
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:28,650
disservice in moving things forward as

1194
00:53:24,989 --> 00:53:30,750
an industry so just quickly

1195
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:33,210
Nicole Elliott just joined the

1196
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,789
conversation a coal we will gently ease

1197
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,619
you in so just listen for a minute and

1198
00:53:35,789 --> 00:53:39,780
then you can get up to speed

1199
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:45,150
Amanda I love everything you were just

1200
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:46,170
talking about in 2015 at the state of

1201
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:49,858
marijuana

1202
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:52,349
we had pony Olivera an economist speak

1203
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:54,179
and he was talking all about you know

1204
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:56,250
price like when you have a comparable

1205
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:59,669
product which is the traditional market

1206
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:02,489
product you can only tax people so much

1207
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:05,220
before you know it's basic economics and

1208
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:07,318
I thought from my perspective you know

1209
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:09,808
common sense would prevail when you have

1210
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:14,608
a competing product and obviously it

1211
00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:17,119
didn't so I'm gonna send everybody that

1212
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:19,798
link because I think it's like you know

1213
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:22,260
everything he was talking about in 2015

1214
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:26,130
of what not to do has since happened and

1215
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:29,369
you know he could do a mic drop with the

1216
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:32,068
cultivation tax which I think every

1217
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:34,769
grower would agree with you which eight

1218
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:38,278
just out of curiosity like which

1219
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:44,099
agencies or who in the government do you

1220
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:46,139
approach to say hey this is crazy like

1221
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:50,818
which eight like is it Richard parrot

1222
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:52,259
the CDFA is it Newsom's office as a who

1223
00:54:50,818 --> 00:54:55,769
do you talk to and start that kind of

1224
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:57,569
press well I think a lot of it is

1225
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:59,429
thinking about where your options lie at

1226
00:54:57,568 --> 00:55:03,000
any given moment so if there's a vehicle

1227
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:04,108
that is in the legislature to do some of

1228
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,659
these things it's really about

1229
00:55:04,108 --> 00:55:09,298
supporting that vehicle this past year

1230
00:55:06,659 --> 00:55:10,920
we had a B 1948 that was introduced by

1231
00:55:09,298 --> 00:55:12,750
Assemblymember Bonta that would have

1232
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,659
eliminated the cultivation tax and

1233
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:17,309
reduced the excise tax that made it to

1234
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:19,230
the finance and tax committee

1235
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:20,519
unfortunately it's not going to make it

1236
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:22,019
out of that committee this session

1237
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:24,179
primarily just because of what's

1238
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:25,829
happening with Kovac however the button

1239
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:26,909
Nicole can definitely speak more to this

1240
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:29,369
but you know we're gonna have the

1241
00:55:26,909 --> 00:55:30,730
governor's trailer bill on and budget

1242
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:33,190
which are going to be coming out here

1243
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:35,079
a little bit later in the summer and so

1244
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:37,510
there's a lot of opportunity to think

1245
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:40,179
about what we need to do for this

1246
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:43,180
industry to help us get through these

1247
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:45,460
next few years and I think that there

1248
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:47,139
are some some sweeping steps that we're

1249
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,150
gonna need to take to make sure that

1250
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:51,190
this industry stays afloat and this

1251
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:53,380
isn't just for the sake of us you know I

1252
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,970
think that you're right but the industry

1253
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,099
sometimes sounds like we're like big

1254
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:59,199
tobacco coming and asking for corporate

1255
00:55:57,099 --> 00:56:00,489
tax breaks and I understand that which

1256
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:02,409
is why I'm like let's start getting the

1257
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:04,839
public back involved and get them to

1258
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:07,440
start talking about this as well but I

1259
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:11,890
think for the state of California I

1260
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:15,490
can't imagine not a I can't imagine a

1261
00:56:11,889 --> 00:56:18,099
world where having a struggling cannabis

1262
00:56:15,489 --> 00:56:20,769
industry is helpful to the economic

1263
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:24,460
recovery of the state of California post

1264
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:26,380
kovat I cannot imagine a scenario where

1265
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:30,369
we are not looking to the cannabis

1266
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:32,920
industry to be robust and to be and

1267
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:37,240
fulfill its promise and fulfill what it

1268
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:39,820
can be when the state so badly needs new

1269
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:41,559
jobs when the state so badly needs

1270
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:44,320
opportunities for people who have been

1271
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:46,150
displaced from other industries you know

1272
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,369
it really is a time for us to come

1273
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:50,108
together and kind of get over the fact

1274
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:52,600
that it's cannabis and start talking

1275
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:54,159
about it as an economic driver which is

1276
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:56,799
honestly what it's always been

1277
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:58,839
even when it was illegal and you know we

1278
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,820
can talk about the illegal economy and

1279
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,858
how much that has supported California

1280
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:05,320
over the years because it absolutely has

1281
00:57:02,858 --> 00:57:07,809
and now we have the opportunity to bring

1282
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:10,539
that industry above board and to allow

1283
00:57:07,809 --> 00:57:13,059
it to really shine I mean to really come

1284
00:57:10,539 --> 00:57:15,009
into its own and we just need folks to

1285
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:16,809
get out of our way what the analogy I

1286
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:19,480
like to use is that you know if cannabis

1287
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:22,239
is a lifeboat and we're telling the

1288
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:24,429
state of California look we can bring

1289
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,349
some folks into this lifeboat you don't

1290
00:57:24,429 --> 00:57:28,779
have to shoulder this alone but this

1291
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:31,210
lifeboat is full of holes and it's not

1292
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,609
seaworthy and we can barely use it to

1293
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:36,519
sustain ourselves help us patch this

1294
00:57:33,608 --> 00:57:38,920
boat and we will bring people into it

1295
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:41,250
and so that is what I'm really looking

1296
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:44,260
for is a way for the cannabis industry

1297
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,579
to be what it needs to be for the state

1298
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,510
of

1299
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:52,980
California so they call let me cue you

1300
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:56,640
up a thriving industry generates lots of

1301
00:57:52,980 --> 00:58:01,230
jobs and taxes currently the cannabis

1302
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:04,230
industry is has a whole bunch of

1303
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:07,530
diseases and is very sick so can you

1304
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:10,139
talk about kind of what the governor's

1305
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:12,570
office is thinking as it looks at this

1306
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:14,909
sick patient and how to get it healthy

1307
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:17,220
and contributing economically and

1308
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:23,159
financially to these state the great

1309
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:24,389
state of California apologies I'm sort

1310
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:26,849
of in and out of this conversation

1311
00:58:24,389 --> 00:58:29,369
because I'm working on a couple of other

1312
00:58:26,849 --> 00:58:31,199
thing have this hold on my calendar but

1313
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:33,960
I believe the question was really about

1314
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:35,519
mechanisms for health is that what you

1315
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:40,250
was that what you asked health of the

1316
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:44,639
industry yeah I mean basically every

1317
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:46,949
operator there is not a single licensed

1318
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:49,920
operator who would disagree with you

1319
00:58:46,949 --> 00:58:52,079
statement you know they're over it's

1320
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,760
they're basically trying to be

1321
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,309
businesses with two hands tied behind

1322
00:58:53,760 --> 00:59:01,230
their backs as compared to any other

1323
00:58:56,309 --> 00:59:04,349
industry California cannabis is not a

1324
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:07,679
poster child for success so from the

1325
00:59:04,349 --> 00:59:12,539
governor's perspective do you do you see

1326
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:16,319
that and where's your where's the

1327
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:18,690
governor's offices head at in terms of

1328
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:22,550
hat how do we fix this problem because

1329
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:25,320
so I think it goes without saying that

1330
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:27,720
the governor recognizes the challenges

1331
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,280
of the industry that's something that he

1332
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:33,899
talked a lot about last year we

1333
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:37,620
collectively talked a lot about just I

1334
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:41,070
think that you know to sort of gut check

1335
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:45,179
this conversation of course nobody saw a

1336
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:49,110
pandemic hit this state of California

1337
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:51,719
the nation the world the in the way that

1338
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:54,360
you know we are now experiencing that

1339
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:56,129
and so that sort of turned many things

1340
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,550
not sort of it has turned many things

1341
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,769
upside down

1342
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:02,289
and you've seen this state really expend

1343
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:07,900
an exceptional amount of resources in

1344
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:10,900
trying to preserve people's lives and in

1345
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:14,650
that in that effort obviously there was

1346
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:17,200
a you know there was a lot of thought

1347
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:19,150
given to what businesses would remain

1348
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:22,059
open and what businesses wouldn't in the

1349
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:26,829
governor as you guys clearly know is

1350
01:00:22,059 --> 01:00:30,429
essential in that effort when we talk

1351
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:32,590
about what lies ahead and what can be

1352
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:34,629
done for the industry I want to make

1353
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:37,210
sure that we're doing it in the context

1354
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:40,329
of the here and now and that is a

1355
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:43,389
challenge economic time for everyone in

1356
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:46,929
the state including businesses that were

1357
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:49,029
not deemed essential and so we as a

1358
01:00:46,929 --> 01:00:51,549
state are gonna have a challenging

1359
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:53,170
economic forecast and we need to keep

1360
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:56,170
that in mind

1361
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:59,889
when we talk about what resources the

1362
01:00:56,170 --> 01:01:02,860
state can expend so I think you know it

1363
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:06,789
is important to contemplate changes that

1364
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:08,590
can be made absent those resources so

1365
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:11,500
thinking about those administrative

1366
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:14,740
changes that can be made I mean perhaps

1367
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:18,309
even statutory changes knowing what

1368
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:20,469
we're up against in the legislature as

1369
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:22,509
far as the legislature having bandwidth

1370
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:26,769
to take up anything non-coated related

1371
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:29,290
at this time so that's a long-winded way

1372
01:01:26,769 --> 01:01:32,139
of saying you know we're sort of seeing

1373
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:34,090
where where everything the dust settles

1374
01:01:32,139 --> 01:01:38,319
and trying to figure out how to best

1375
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:42,340
proceed knowing that our objective has

1376
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:44,380
been and will continue to be to ease the

1377
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:48,150
burdens on the industry whether that be

1378
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:51,099
regulatory administrative or financial

1379
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:55,740
where possible but that has to be

1380
01:01:51,099 --> 01:01:55,739
couched in the context of these times

1381
01:01:57,449 --> 01:02:04,779
Nicole this is a this is Adam Spiker how

1382
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:07,869
you doing good how are you Adam lovely

1383
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:09,880
doing lovely just enjoying life here in

1384
01:02:07,869 --> 01:02:11,368
Southern California I totally appreciate

1385
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:13,798
everything you're saying and it

1386
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:16,470
as you know you and I've talked before I

1387
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:18,298
think the legal industry has complete

1388
01:02:16,469 --> 01:02:19,798
sympathy and respect for what the

1389
01:02:18,298 --> 01:02:23,338
priorities have to be for the

1390
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:26,608
administration given koban 19 and and

1391
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:28,858
what we're dealing with you know what I

1392
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:30,889
would say to you is in you know we've

1393
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:33,389
talked about it you know privately but

1394
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:36,838
what we're trying to do is just present

1395
01:02:33,389 --> 01:02:39,798
you know a fix or two for the industry

1396
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:42,748
that is now two and a half years in and

1397
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:45,298
and just frankly getting its ass kicked

1398
01:02:42,748 --> 01:02:48,358
by the illicit market and I know you

1399
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:50,548
mentioned obviously the budget and and

1400
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:52,230
other you know other panelists talked

1401
01:02:50,548 --> 01:02:54,659
about it and you know more candidly

1402
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:57,809
before you joined but obviously the

1403
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:59,429
budgets in is in peril no one knows what

1404
01:02:57,809 --> 01:03:01,798
that budgets gonna look like and no one

1405
01:02:59,429 --> 01:03:03,868
knows when the you know we don't know if

1406
01:03:01,798 --> 01:03:05,730
the Trump administration is gonna gonna

1407
01:03:03,869 --> 01:03:08,640
help relieve the state of California

1408
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:11,429
it's local governments all that aside I

1409
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:15,659
do think that there is an argument to

1410
01:03:11,429 --> 01:03:18,328
make that the legal industry has now two

1411
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:21,118
and a half years in not had a chance to

1412
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:23,190
compete and we also believe in you know

1413
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,499
the Elio report got brought up earlier

1414
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:27,599
I think there's faults in that report I

1415
01:03:25,498 --> 01:03:30,748
wish there was time to refute them we've

1416
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,970
tried to refute it I don't think they

1417
01:03:30,748 --> 01:03:35,278
show their work very well for others

1418
01:03:32,969 --> 01:03:38,368
outside of it to be able to take that

1419
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:41,190
work and try to refute it especially as

1420
01:03:38,369 --> 01:03:45,289
it relates to the illicit market and

1421
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:48,150
trying to offset tax reductions not

1422
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:51,930
simplification or restructuring but

1423
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:53,730
offset tax relief by capturing more of

1424
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:56,308
the illicit market into the regulating

1425
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:57,929
realm I I would assume you agree with

1426
01:03:56,309 --> 01:04:00,119
that I know it's a challenge in this

1427
01:03:57,929 --> 01:04:01,679
environment but I'd be remiss if I

1428
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:03,599
didn't bring it up is just something

1429
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:05,788
that you know if we were gonna pick one

1430
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:08,999
or two things that are a priority for an

1431
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:11,400
industry where all these industries and

1432
01:04:08,998 --> 01:04:12,988
all these residents and constituents are

1433
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,720
coming to the governor's office in the

1434
01:04:12,989 --> 01:04:18,028
administration saying we need help if we

1435
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:20,939
could focus on one or two things for the

1436
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:22,409
kegel cannabis it would have to start

1437
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,950
there and I think the stories on our

1438
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:30,578
side

1439
01:04:23,949 --> 01:04:32,529
I don't mean as far as responding to

1440
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:35,079
that I think what I'm hearing you say is

1441
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:38,140
as an industry of the industry where to

1442
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:40,300
have to pick one or two things to focus

1443
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:42,250
on this year enforcement should be top

1444
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:46,060
of that is that accurate

1445
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:48,670
I think it's taxes I think it's the car

1446
01:04:46,059 --> 01:04:51,429
let me let me broaden that and certainly

1447
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:53,920
allow others to chime in it's at the end

1448
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:56,139
point it becomes the price point for the

1449
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:59,050
illegal the illegal market versus the

1450
01:04:56,139 --> 01:05:01,900
legal market so right now it's about

1451
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:04,630
double and Greg can chime in and others

1452
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:07,329
you know that are operators you know if

1453
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:10,108
we restructure taxes or simplify them

1454
01:05:07,329 --> 01:05:13,000
but the end result is that a consumer

1455
01:05:10,108 --> 01:05:14,679
especially in a world where unemployment

1456
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,519
I think in the states about four million

1457
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:20,199
and you know nationally thirty million

1458
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:23,650
they're gonna be more price conscious if

1459
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:26,469
at the end of the day legal cannabis you

1460
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:28,960
know is double the price just to make

1461
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:32,169
ends meet of the illicit they don't have

1462
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:35,108
a chance so I think it's I think it's

1463
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:36,880
the economic argument but I want to make

1464
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:39,549
clear to you that we're sympathetic of

1465
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,950
understanding that the governor's got a

1466
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:43,990
lot on his plate and certainly the

1467
01:05:41,949 --> 01:05:46,679
administration and the legislature has a

1468
01:05:43,989 --> 01:05:51,279
lot on their plate we also believe that

1469
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:53,230
we there's 80% of the of the demand for

1470
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:56,079
cannabis in the state there to be

1471
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:59,230
captured by the state and local

1472
01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:00,880
governments and regulated means we just

1473
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:08,949
needed to be more competitive in order

1474
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:11,588
to start capturing more of it and you

1475
01:06:08,949 --> 01:06:14,529
know just to reiterate everything that

1476
01:06:11,588 --> 01:06:17,259
Adam said it's absolutely true I mean we

1477
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:20,890
are I just had another illegal store

1478
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:24,880
open up a thousand feet from me and so

1479
01:06:20,889 --> 01:06:27,190
enforcement it enforcement is never

1480
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,019
truly gonna work and you're never gonna

1481
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:31,030
really get rid of all the illegals

1482
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:33,219
especially in a big city where

1483
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:35,019
everything's so congested and law

1484
01:06:33,219 --> 01:06:37,299
enforcement already has their hands full

1485
01:06:35,019 --> 01:06:37,719
with because gangs and narcotics are the

1486
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,090
ones that

1487
01:06:37,719 --> 01:06:42,159
doing the investigations and raids and

1488
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:43,930
like we had discussed earlier now

1489
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:46,659
they're doing investigations and trying

1490
01:06:43,929 --> 01:06:49,419
to do raids on people that is it's not

1491
01:06:46,659 --> 01:06:52,690
even a felony now selling illegal

1492
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:55,570
cannabis so I believe the only way is

1493
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:57,909
going to be through reducing the taxes

1494
01:06:55,570 --> 01:07:01,530
so that we can be competitive with the

1495
01:06:57,909 --> 01:07:05,259
illicit market and that way the consumer

1496
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:07,090
and it doesn't have to be lower than the

1497
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:08,890
illicit market or even equal if it's

1498
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:11,140
just to the point where it's only a

1499
01:07:08,889 --> 01:07:14,799
couple of dollars or a few dollars more

1500
01:07:11,139 --> 01:07:17,829
expensive we can start also education

1501
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:20,200
program where it starts educating the

1502
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:22,630
consumer that hey yeah maybe the illicit

1503
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:25,389
market is only a couple dollars more now

1504
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:27,490
since we lower the taxes but is your

1505
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:30,909
health worth of paying a couple of

1506
01:07:27,489 --> 01:07:33,608
dollars less to buy illegal products

1507
01:07:30,909 --> 01:07:35,559
that are not lab tested so it's two

1508
01:07:33,608 --> 01:07:37,659
things right you've got you got to lower

1509
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:39,909
the taxes and you have to do an

1510
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:42,429
education program like we see all those

1511
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:45,699
commercials on TV for the vaping and

1512
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:48,190
tobacco hey don't buy illegal cannabis

1513
01:07:45,699 --> 01:07:48,819
by legal cannabis because it's not gonna

1514
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,710
kill you

1515
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:59,480
and it's not going to have pesticides in

1516
01:07:50,710 --> 01:08:04,429
it that's all

1517
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:07,579
I want to add one dynamic in here if I

1518
01:08:04,429 --> 01:08:10,879
could as a consumer and a patient who

1519
01:08:07,579 --> 01:08:13,539
increasingly sees the industry from that

1520
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:18,650
perspective almost actually now

1521
01:08:13,539 --> 01:08:22,430
universally I I wonder how the powers

1522
01:08:18,649 --> 01:08:25,670
that be are they cognizant of the you

1523
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:28,960
know the amount of anger there is at

1524
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:31,730
being charged user e tax rates as a

1525
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:36,289
consumer a lot of these taxes rolled

1526
01:08:31,729 --> 01:08:38,449
downhill right on to us and I'm you know

1527
01:08:36,289 --> 01:08:41,298
I'd be interested to get a perspective

1528
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:43,970
from retailers they're people who are

1529
01:08:41,298 --> 01:08:47,509
public facing what they're hearing what

1530
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:52,100
they've dealt with because it's

1531
01:08:47,509 --> 01:08:56,479
unacceptable I have I've had no qualms

1532
01:08:52,100 --> 01:09:00,350
over the years of telling legislators my

1533
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:03,769
since I'm just one person so I you know

1534
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:05,600
III be interested in you know people's

1535
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:09,470
thoughts on that dynamic because I think

1536
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:11,660
it's real Tom you're absolutely correct

1537
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:13,369
you know the retailer's being in the you

1538
01:09:11,659 --> 01:09:16,278
know the tip of the spear if you want to

1539
01:09:13,369 --> 01:09:19,430
call it you know we get we get bashed

1540
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:21,589
for everything you know the the

1541
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:24,710
consumers love two batches that like the

1542
01:09:21,588 --> 01:09:26,720
taxes are our fault somehow so it is

1543
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:29,470
actually it's absolutely correct they

1544
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:32,029
are upset and they have no problem

1545
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:34,009
letting us retailers know that they're

1546
01:09:32,029 --> 01:09:35,839
upset and usually my answer is please

1547
01:09:34,009 --> 01:09:38,960
call your legislator and let them know

1548
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:41,720
because it's out of our control but they

1549
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,189
are absolutely furious and you know

1550
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,170
we've been told well this is why I'm

1551
01:09:43,189 --> 01:09:46,969
never gonna stop at the illegal play a

1552
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:48,619
legal place I'm gonna go up the street

1553
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:51,409
to the illegal place and they literally

1554
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:53,479
tell me where they're going because they

1555
01:09:51,409 --> 01:09:56,180
think nothing's gonna happen that person

1556
01:09:53,479 --> 01:10:00,169
and it's all a joke enforcement is a

1557
01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:02,570
joke and our taxes and our high prices

1558
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:05,060
are a joke and you probably have more

1559
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:07,909
like sixty seventy percent of the market

1560
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:11,060
buying from illegal market not from the

1561
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:12,889
legal market item I want to add

1562
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:15,200
something that's not kind of a little

1563
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:16,820
a bit of a different take on you know

1564
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:19,279
other wastes from the consumers

1565
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:21,409
perspective because Tom I really agree

1566
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:25,219
with you in Nepal hi is Amanda Ryman

1567
01:10:21,409 --> 01:10:26,869
from uh so kana so you know I when I

1568
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:29,300
first started doing research on medical

1569
01:10:26,869 --> 01:10:32,119
cannabis dispensaries it was 2005 and I

1570
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:33,800
did a study on how dispensaries were

1571
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:36,680
operating as community health service

1572
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,029
providers and that was really because as

1573
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,130
folks who have been doing this for a

1574
01:10:38,029 --> 01:10:42,920
while know you know in San Francisco

1575
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:44,810
coming out of the AIDS crisis was really

1576
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,600
when you saw these dispensaries start to

1577
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:49,580
proliferate and you saw people providing

1578
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:53,390
community services in addition to

1579
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:55,670
cannabis in these dispensaries and so it

1580
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:58,520
wasn't just about buying weed right it

1581
01:10:55,670 --> 01:11:00,829
was about taking yoga and working in the

1582
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,600
garden and having access to Internet and

1583
01:11:00,829 --> 01:11:03,949
having access to pure support and

1584
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,140
counseling Americans for safe access

1585
01:11:03,949 --> 01:11:08,840
used to come in and do pure counseling

1586
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:11,210
you know we had lawyers that would come

1587
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:13,760
in and give free legal advice and so I

1588
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:15,319
think all this is to say that you know

1589
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,680
kind of like taking a full-spectrum

1590
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:21,519
plant and then distilling it into THC

1591
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:24,230
we've taken this beautiful cultural

1592
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,290
experience of interacting with cannabis

1593
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:30,109
and distilled it to Walgreens and I

1594
01:11:27,289 --> 01:11:33,170
think that that has really disadvantaged

1595
01:11:30,109 --> 01:11:35,779
the consumer not just because of the

1596
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:37,430
taxes but because of the education and

1597
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:40,009
knowledge and community that they used

1598
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:42,050
to get from that experience so all this

1599
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:43,909
is to say is that we need alternative

1600
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:45,890
models of retail we need to start

1601
01:11:43,909 --> 01:11:49,550
opening up the idea of what it means to

1602
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:52,039
get cannabis and start offering other

1603
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:54,470
pathways to that besides just

1604
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:56,689
dispensaries so you know we need farmers

1605
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:59,030
markets we need direct to consumer sales

1606
01:11:56,689 --> 01:12:01,489
from the farmer we need more

1607
01:11:59,029 --> 01:12:03,849
opportunities for subscription boxes and

1608
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:06,109
mail order you know we need more

1609
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:08,900
opportunities for people to grow and

1610
01:12:06,109 --> 01:12:10,819
process their own cannabis at their own

1611
01:12:08,899 --> 01:12:12,649
homes so we need to look at where

1612
01:12:10,819 --> 01:12:14,090
they're not allowed to do that and why

1613
01:12:12,649 --> 01:12:17,000
because that's definitely the most

1614
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:18,980
economical way to consume cannabis is to

1615
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,899
grow it yourself so I think that you

1616
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:24,859
know we get focused a lot on what the

1617
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:25,670
current model is and how we tweak those

1618
01:12:24,859 --> 01:12:27,409
taxes

1619
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:30,920
those models but I also think we need to

1620
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:32,809
be really thinking outside the box which

1621
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:35,270
is a term that I think is way overused

1622
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:38,360
but thinking back to those days of the

1623
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:40,429
community model of cannabis retail and

1624
01:12:38,359 --> 01:12:43,130
you know we sound like we saw a huge

1625
01:12:40,429 --> 01:12:44,659
amount of social problems as a result of

1626
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:46,100
the fact that it was super easy for

1627
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:48,289
people to go into dispensaries and get

1628
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:50,300
cannabis you know we aren't we weren't

1629
01:12:48,289 --> 01:12:53,238
trying to solve for a public health

1630
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:56,510
crisis around cannabis access we never

1631
01:12:53,238 --> 01:12:59,059
have and we won't unless we keep pushing

1632
01:12:56,510 --> 01:13:01,159
people into unregulated marketplaces and

1633
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:03,500
then we will absolutely have a public

1634
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:06,769
health crisis around cannabis booky

1635
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:10,460
Valley which we had before kovat so you

1636
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:13,460
know it's just such a vulnerable time

1637
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:16,909
for medical cannabis patients many of

1638
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:18,829
them are immunocompromised anyway so the

1639
01:13:16,909 --> 01:13:21,559
the idea that they don't have the access

1640
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:23,719
that they need that they have to go

1641
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,880
through this one very specific model of

1642
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:28,340
retail that may not speak to their needs

1643
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:30,590
I think is also a big threat to the

1644
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:32,300
industry because I you know those

1645
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:34,069
individuals are gonna still need their

1646
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,900
cannabis and they're gonna get it from

1647
01:13:34,069 --> 01:13:37,909
the place that they feel is safest and

1648
01:13:35,899 --> 01:13:39,799
is most economical to their needs

1649
01:13:37,909 --> 01:13:42,769
they're not naive these aren't new

1650
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:45,829
consumers and so we really have to meet

1651
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:47,690
them where they're at I just want to say

1652
01:13:45,829 --> 01:13:50,479
Amanda that I appreciate those comments

1653
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:51,829
I appreciate sort of I really appreciate

1654
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:53,750
the approach that you're coming at it

1655
01:13:51,829 --> 01:13:55,550
you even though you hate the term

1656
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:58,460
thinking outside the box I think that's

1657
01:13:55,550 --> 01:14:00,380
really what's necessary right now we all

1658
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:02,719
really need to get creative and how we

1659
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:04,880
approach addressing things like

1660
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:07,489
financial burdens and enforcement

1661
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:09,859
because you're absolutely right

1662
01:14:07,488 --> 01:14:11,869
you know tweaking the existing model is

1663
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:14,170
one way of getting at it but it's not

1664
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:17,689
the only way and we should really be

1665
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:21,850
maximizing you know which avenues were

1666
01:14:17,689 --> 01:14:21,849
pursuing so thank you

1667
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:29,039
[Music]

1668
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:33,929
you know I just want to comment that I

1669
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:37,710
think the I have a lot of respect for

1670
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:41,970
the argument the health argument by

1671
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:45,149
legal buy healthier but I think it may

1672
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:48,240
not have as much traction as it would

1673
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:50,759
otherwise precisely because so many of

1674
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:52,649
us do come out of the gray or

1675
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:55,320
traditional market and have years of

1676
01:14:52,649 --> 01:14:57,599
experience there we were we all come out

1677
01:14:55,319 --> 01:15:01,109
of it we've all work work were our

1678
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:05,610
children of the of the traditional

1679
01:15:01,109 --> 01:15:09,359
market and we weren't you know really

1680
01:15:05,609 --> 01:15:14,909
suffering horrible health consequences

1681
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:17,250
as a result plus it's you know people

1682
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:21,300
there might indeed be more receptive to

1683
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:24,840
individual needs you might know more

1684
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:27,320
what you're getting then a CPG packaged

1685
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:30,390
in a retail store where you're donating

1686
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:34,170
exactly sure despite the fact that it

1687
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:36,539
has its CEO a and I just think that

1688
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:40,079
those are subtle dynamics that are very

1689
01:15:36,539 --> 01:15:42,300
real with people and that cannabis is a

1690
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:45,269
very personal personalized

1691
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:47,850
individualized experience for so many

1692
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:53,250
people and they don't necessarily have

1693
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:56,490
that that that fear of traversing the

1694
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:58,079
traditional market and I'm back I don't

1695
01:15:56,489 --> 01:16:01,769
think that dynamic is necessarily true

1696
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:04,920
for new people coming in but who don't

1697
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:08,070
know but I think that might be one of

1698
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:11,640
the you know one of the problems with

1699
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:14,130
that with that as argument well I think

1700
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:17,340
we also have to remember that just like

1701
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:19,380
every substance the majority of the

1702
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:22,470
substance is consumed by a small

1703
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:24,420
percentage of the consumer so you know

1704
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:27,150
when we talk about the people that are

1705
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:28,949
buying the most cannabis that are really

1706
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:30,449
making up the most of the marketplace

1707
01:16:28,949 --> 01:16:33,179
it's a very small percentage of people

1708
01:16:30,449 --> 01:16:35,069
and so if that's if those are the people

1709
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:36,480
that we need to get into the regulated

1710
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:38,849
marketplace it's not the purse

1711
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,709
and that's buying cannabis once a year

1712
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:42,120
or you know for a special occasion

1713
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:43,949
because they are gonna go to the

1714
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:46,590
regulated marketplace it's the person

1715
01:16:43,949 --> 01:16:48,809
that is using cannabis regularly for

1716
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:52,050
medicinal purposes that's you know

1717
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:53,610
purchasing a larger amount that's the

1718
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:56,550
person we need to bring in and that's

1719
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:59,159
also the person that's most likely going

1720
01:16:56,550 --> 01:17:01,170
to go into the unregulated marketplace

1721
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:09,210
both because of economics and because of

1722
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:11,850
comfort with that marketplace knew their

1723
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:14,789
growers and we're working with them and

1724
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:18,780
you know we had 20 years of that and we

1725
01:17:14,789 --> 01:17:21,300
had 20 years of access to safe products

1726
01:17:18,779 --> 01:17:24,659
I've got a file folder in my home office

1727
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:26,430
with lab reports from 2012 because we

1728
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:29,399
were testing before we delivered

1729
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:32,670
anything to a dispensary you know so

1730
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:34,859
there were those mechanisms in place for

1731
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:37,020
the dispensaries who were enforcing that

1732
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:39,659
and were only selling lab tested

1733
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:42,780
products and they thrived and they did

1734
01:17:39,659 --> 01:17:44,880
well under prop 215 well because the

1735
01:17:42,779 --> 01:17:46,170
consumers drove that I mean and that's

1736
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,760
something that you know consume a

1737
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:49,649
cannabis consumers you know as were

1738
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:53,550
saying their relationship with the plant

1739
01:17:49,649 --> 01:17:56,009
is so personal and so intense that they

1740
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:57,630
really do think a lot about what they

1741
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:59,520
want to put in their bodies and they

1742
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:01,560
were demanding that dispensaries give

1743
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,390
them more information and you know I

1744
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,910
started working at Berkeley patients

1745
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:08,369
group in 2010 and worked there till 2012

1746
01:18:05,909 --> 01:18:10,289
and we started to sell product that was

1747
01:18:08,369 --> 01:18:13,199
tested because patients were coming in

1748
01:18:10,289 --> 01:18:16,079
and saying I need to know what's in this

1749
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:20,789
and you know I saw in the evolution from

1750
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:23,460
like 2005 to 2012 edibles go from like

1751
01:18:20,789 --> 01:18:25,979
just cellophane wrapped brownies with no

1752
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:28,649
label like a bake sale to people

1753
01:18:25,979 --> 01:18:30,419
actually trying to tell you how much THC

1754
01:18:28,649 --> 01:18:31,829
was in it and this was because the state

1755
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:34,199
was making us do that there were no

1756
01:18:31,829 --> 01:18:36,090
rules around it it was because consumers

1757
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:38,359
were saying this is something that I

1758
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:41,220
need to make sure that I'm dosing myself

1759
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:45,210
accurately and so I really believe that

1760
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:47,460
if we opened up more farm direct sales

1761
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:50,800
where farmers could sell directly to

1762
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:53,619
consumers we would capture a lot of

1763
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,329
those regular consumers those that are

1764
01:18:53,619 --> 01:18:56,890
that are consuming most of the cannabis

1765
01:18:55,329 --> 01:18:59,409
because we're giving them a way to

1766
01:18:56,890 --> 01:19:01,090
connect personally with the product

1767
01:18:59,409 --> 01:19:03,399
again in the farmer and that's

1768
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:05,050
definitely something we lost you know

1769
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:07,269
with although the packaging which I get

1770
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:08,890
I totally understand why we have it but

1771
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:11,260
you know walking into a dispensary and

1772
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:13,560
smelling like everything that they had

1773
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:16,329
behind the case and being able to choose

1774
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:17,980
you know being able to have that more of

1775
01:19:16,329 --> 01:19:20,199
that relationship with the farmer I

1776
01:19:17,979 --> 01:19:22,719
think that's what that specific

1777
01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:25,359
population of heavier consumers is

1778
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:27,850
looking for they're not looking for like

1779
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:30,939
super low dose really pretty packaging

1780
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:32,770
CBD treats you know they want to tow and

1781
01:19:30,939 --> 01:19:36,489
talk to the guy that grew their cannabis

1782
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:38,680
for like 40 minutes about genetics and

1783
01:19:36,489 --> 01:19:41,380
there there isn't that outlet for those

1784
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:44,680
folks anymore like you know the area 101

1785
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:48,489
you know old school Emerald cup types

1786
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:50,200
advantage mm-hmm yeah as you were

1787
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:52,510
talking I was actually writing down

1788
01:19:50,199 --> 01:19:55,119
farmers markets and they talked about it

1789
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:57,699
I mean I think for every farmer who

1790
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:59,789
grows quality product and as a smart

1791
01:19:57,699 --> 01:20:02,949
intelligent person that would be a

1792
01:19:59,789 --> 01:20:05,470
lifeline lifeline survival because

1793
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:08,590
they're small they don't need to clear a

1794
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:11,170
lot of product in December at a like

1795
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:12,940
Emerald you know the NorCal farmers who

1796
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:16,510
would come down to the Emerald Exchange

1797
01:20:12,939 --> 01:20:19,269
in December with their recent harvest

1798
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:21,750
proudly sharing it with the SoCal market

1799
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:26,290
and educating them on sun-grown cannabis

1800
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:29,350
they don't need to sell a lot to clear

1801
01:20:26,289 --> 01:20:31,449
out their inventory and be able to move

1802
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:33,760
on to thinking about the next season and

1803
01:20:31,449 --> 01:20:36,569
right now they're at the mercy of the

1804
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:40,180
distribution networks and the retailers

1805
01:20:36,569 --> 01:20:44,889
convincing consumers in LA that this

1806
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:47,380
tiny brand is worth your time this is

1807
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:50,470
also a great and I just want to touch on

1808
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:53,619
something because one thing that was

1809
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:56,020
mentioned also is the experience right

1810
01:20:53,619 --> 01:20:58,659
and that is something that the

1811
01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:00,670
dispensaries were robbed of is that

1812
01:20:58,659 --> 01:21:03,099
experience and being able to provide

1813
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:03,640
that experience where you show the

1814
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:06,730
product

1815
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:09,010
you smell it you actually get to see it

1816
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:12,549
being laid out in front of you you know

1817
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:14,949
that holistic approach that we had

1818
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:17,890
coming out of the medical we have lost

1819
01:21:14,949 --> 01:21:19,929
that and that has also affected us

1820
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:21,940
against the illicit market because they

1821
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:24,700
still are doing it that way if they do

1822
01:21:21,939 --> 01:21:27,429
it but with us it's now it's no longer

1823
01:21:24,699 --> 01:21:29,949
personable that that engagement that

1824
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:32,800
relationship with the consumer you know

1825
01:21:29,949 --> 01:21:35,260
it's become more cold you know and we do

1826
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:37,690
different things to try to change that

1827
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:39,430
but it becomes it becomes very difficult

1828
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:42,819
because you know everything's

1829
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:44,500
prepackaged and the consumer even though

1830
01:21:42,819 --> 01:21:48,009
in their mind yeah I see your little

1831
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:50,800
sample I'm staring at it but I still

1832
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:53,110
really don't know until I get home when

1833
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:55,989
I open that package what I'm really

1834
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:59,380
getting and so that in a way has also

1835
01:21:55,989 --> 01:22:02,979
affected the legal retailers because

1836
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:04,779
that experience that we had broad kind

1837
01:22:02,979 --> 01:22:06,519
of like a farmers market where you go

1838
01:22:04,779 --> 01:22:08,649
you look at the fruits and vegetables

1839
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,540
everything it's gone you know and and we

1840
01:22:08,649 --> 01:22:13,089
still have a whole bunch of vendors that

1841
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:14,859
would show up on our appreciation days

1842
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:16,900
once a month and they would all have

1843
01:22:14,859 --> 01:22:19,000
their products and they would all set up

1844
01:22:16,899 --> 01:22:21,759
different tables like our own little

1845
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,260
mini farmers market and that experience

1846
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,480
is gone as well

1847
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:26,829
yeah and now when they show up well now

1848
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:30,459
they don't show up because it ovid

1849
01:22:26,829 --> 01:22:32,920
nobody's going but when they used to it

1850
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:35,350
became oh here's a hat or a t-shirt you

1851
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:36,850
know and I could talk to you about the

1852
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:40,210
product but I have nothing to show you

1853
01:22:36,850 --> 01:22:43,240
you know and so it it really changed the

1854
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:47,319
whole dynamic of what we had gotten used

1855
01:22:43,239 --> 01:22:49,420
to for over two decades you know and and

1856
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:52,269
I think that is a very very good point

1857
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:53,289
so just quickly cuz nicole has to jump

1858
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:55,420
off for a meeting

1859
01:22:53,289 --> 01:22:57,130
Nicola thank you for being such a good

1860
01:22:55,420 --> 01:23:00,789
sport she had no idea that I was gonna

1861
01:22:57,130 --> 01:23:01,210
send her a link to join this call joined

1862
01:23:00,789 --> 01:23:05,279
it

1863
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:05,279
so let's encourage her to do it again

1864
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:13,929
Nicole I sent you that link to the 2015

1865
01:23:11,369 --> 01:23:15,349
Economist talking about price elasticity

1866
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:17,570
and

1867
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:21,320
economics you know I hope this state

1868
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:25,309
views cannabis like Walmart and Costco

1869
01:23:21,319 --> 01:23:28,309
view profits which is if there is a lot

1870
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:32,300
if we do low margins which for the state

1871
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:35,330
would be low taxes and high-volume we

1872
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:38,060
will make more money than high margin

1873
01:23:35,329 --> 01:23:40,460
and low volume and all these small

1874
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:43,610
operators going extinct and not being

1875
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:45,470
able to hire people and job losses and

1876
01:23:43,609 --> 01:23:49,219
things like that

1877
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:52,240
so anyway that's my two cents on how I

1878
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:54,740
would hope the state approaches taxes

1879
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:59,529
thank you thank you guys for having me I

1880
01:23:54,739 --> 01:24:00,859
appreciate it thanks thank you guys all

1881
01:23:59,529 --> 01:24:04,099
right

1882
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:07,609
Tom our most I actually have a question

1883
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:10,010
for I have a question do the people here

1884
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:15,619
think that generally speaking the state

1885
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:18,530
needs more legal shops I think in

1886
01:24:15,619 --> 01:24:20,779
certain areas they do yeah I think they

1887
01:24:18,529 --> 01:24:23,119
do I mean they're just because there's

1888
01:24:20,779 --> 01:24:24,920
so many areas that have banned I mean

1889
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:27,199
it's not necessarily like are we adding

1890
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:30,020
more in some places it's like are we

1891
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:33,139
adding any and you know I think that the

1892
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:34,130
state really should take this up and you

1893
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:35,619
know this was something that we had

1894
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:37,730
cloak on ahead put into our

1895
01:24:35,619 --> 01:24:39,170
recommendations for legislation but we

1896
01:24:37,729 --> 01:24:41,119
know that you know with because of the

1897
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:43,310
budget and cost but this idea of market

1898
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:46,039
expansion and the state really getting

1899
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:48,110
involved in helping localities pass

1900
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:50,510
commercial cultivation ordinances and

1901
01:24:48,109 --> 01:24:51,920
cannabis ordinances when maybe before

1902
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:53,510
they've been reticent because they

1903
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,649
thought it was gonna be too hard or they

1904
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:57,170
didn't have but they didn't know what to

1905
01:24:54,649 --> 01:24:59,319
do and you know so I think that if the

1906
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:02,210
state can really start encouraging

1907
01:24:59,319 --> 01:25:04,189
localities to pass ordinances and maybe

1908
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:06,800
major owner ate a model ordinance or be

1909
01:25:04,189 --> 01:25:07,789
willing to give them some support then

1910
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,770
we'll start to see some of these

1911
01:25:07,789 --> 01:25:11,510
cannabis deserts change and I think now

1912
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:13,220
it's time to strike while the iron is

1913
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:15,289
hot because these localities are going

1914
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:17,000
to be looking for job creation they're

1915
01:25:15,289 --> 01:25:20,180
gonna be looking for sources of revenue

1916
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,279
post kovat you know we hear countries

1917
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:25,000
all over the world now talking about

1918
01:25:22,279 --> 01:25:28,908
legalizing cannabis as economic recovery

1919
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,590
functions so I do think it's time and

1920
01:25:28,908 --> 01:25:33,078
could start with localities and I always

1921
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:35,958
like to pick on Marin let's start with

1922
01:25:33,078 --> 01:25:38,208
Marin that voted overwhelmingly for Prop

1923
01:25:35,958 --> 01:25:40,340
64 but has banned commercial cannabis

1924
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:42,948
activity and you know there's so much

1925
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:45,019
NIMBYism let's start there and let's

1926
01:25:42,948 --> 01:25:47,768
really put pressure on them to open it

1927
01:25:45,019 --> 01:25:50,329
up so quick quick adding to this dist

1928
01:25:47,769 --> 01:25:52,458
sixty-four need to be a man you to do

1929
01:25:50,328 --> 01:25:55,099
this did it not codify the patchwork

1930
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:57,260
nature in this state mmm so how do we

1931
01:25:55,099 --> 01:25:59,269
get how do we get it definitely includes

1932
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:00,829
local control and in order to change

1933
01:25:59,269 --> 01:26:03,559
that that's all about the League of

1934
01:26:00,828 --> 01:26:05,208
Cities so the League of Cities you know

1935
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:07,849
local control has been there sticking

1936
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:09,498
point for Oh 20 years League of Cities

1937
01:26:07,849 --> 01:26:12,110
long-term Friends of the cannabis

1938
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:16,340
industry yes long term cannabis industry

1939
01:26:12,109 --> 01:26:18,438
you know so local control was in the

1940
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:21,380
medical legislation that was passed in

1941
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:24,050
2015 and it was actually stricter than

1942
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:27,019
it was in prop 64 we actually wanted to

1943
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:28,939
get rid of local control and prop 64 the

1944
01:26:27,019 --> 01:26:30,708
compromise was to make it a little bit

1945
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:33,739
less onerous than it was in the medical

1946
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:35,238
regs but to still keep it in there we

1947
01:26:33,738 --> 01:26:36,708
have met with the League of Cities we've

1948
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:39,049
taken their temperature on this they

1949
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:41,208
have had some leadership change it has

1950
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:42,708
been good leadership change but that's

1951
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:45,198
really who we have to have come to the

1952
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:48,979
table to really do anything to eliminate

1953
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:51,618
local control so absent of that I think

1954
01:26:48,979 --> 01:26:56,050
we need to make it as easy as possible

1955
01:26:51,618 --> 01:26:59,139
like turnkey local regulation so that

1956
01:26:56,050 --> 01:27:01,909
localities can just turn it on or

1957
01:26:59,139 --> 01:27:05,389
localities can pass an ordinance that

1958
01:27:01,908 --> 01:27:07,848
says if a business applies for a state

1959
01:27:05,389 --> 01:27:09,918
license and meets all those requirements

1960
01:27:07,849 --> 01:27:11,418
we will give them local authorization

1961
01:27:09,918 --> 01:27:13,609
like we don't have to pass a local

1962
01:27:11,418 --> 01:27:15,828
ordinance but if someone's ready to go

1963
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:17,748
and they meet all the requirements we

1964
01:27:15,828 --> 01:27:19,308
will grant them authorization which is

1965
01:27:17,748 --> 01:27:21,408
what the state's looking for in order to

1966
01:27:19,309 --> 01:27:22,760
grant their licensure so I think that

1967
01:27:21,408 --> 01:27:25,308
there's some ways that we can wiggle

1968
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:28,820
around it but until we really engage

1969
01:27:25,309 --> 01:27:30,679
these localities adding another 500

1970
01:27:28,819 --> 01:27:33,139
dispensaries in San Francisco or another

1971
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:34,908
thousand dispensaries in LA is gonna

1972
01:27:33,139 --> 01:27:37,719
help some things but it's not gonna help

1973
01:27:34,908 --> 01:27:40,609
a person that's in a cannabis desert

1974
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:42,849
unless we have mail order then that

1975
01:27:40,609 --> 01:27:47,868
would help them

1976
01:27:42,849 --> 01:27:51,440
so who was we yeah go ahead more retail

1977
01:27:47,868 --> 01:27:53,750
I think we're at something like eleven

1978
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:57,558
hundred and fifty when you count

1979
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:59,569
storefront retail delivery and micro

1980
01:27:57,559 --> 01:27:59,989
business with retail or somewhere around

1981
01:27:59,569 --> 01:28:03,049
there

1982
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:07,789
for forty million people in a you know

1983
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:10,880
incredibly big vast state so you know

1984
01:28:07,789 --> 01:28:14,289
that what we need to figure out how to

1985
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:17,389
incentivize locale local municipalities

1986
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:18,408
and you know in the beginning it was

1987
01:28:17,389 --> 01:28:20,289
well you're not gonna get any

1988
01:28:18,408 --> 01:28:23,988
enforcement dollars unless you regulate

1989
01:28:20,289 --> 01:28:25,609
retail and cultivation and that doesn't

1990
01:28:23,988 --> 01:28:28,039
seem to have worked so maybe we have to

1991
01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:29,929
you know up to that amount that that

1992
01:28:28,039 --> 01:28:31,819
jurisdictions are getting and then shine

1993
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:35,389
a big spotlight on it and say look who's

1994
01:28:31,819 --> 01:28:39,170
getting the tax dollars over here but

1995
01:28:35,389 --> 01:28:43,130
you know Los Angeles is very interesting

1996
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:45,440
and it's the consumer cannabis consumer

1997
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:48,170
capital of the world I believe there's

1998
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:52,189
more consumers per capita than in any

1999
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:54,559
other jurisdiction and if we could get

2000
01:28:52,189 --> 01:28:56,868
LA you know to at least be moving in a

2001
01:28:54,559 --> 01:28:59,809
positive direction it could turn the

2002
01:28:56,868 --> 01:29:03,109
entire industry so I know that you know

2003
01:28:59,809 --> 01:29:05,360
there's been a lot of drama over the

2004
01:29:03,109 --> 01:29:10,609
first 100 equity permits that have been

2005
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:13,939
issued and a compromise to the 700 that

2006
01:29:10,609 --> 01:29:15,618
are you know and technically all 800 are

2007
01:29:13,939 --> 01:29:17,289
sitting on the sidelines waiting for the

2008
01:29:15,618 --> 01:29:21,679
city to figure out what they're gonna do

2009
01:29:17,289 --> 01:29:24,349
but the the compromise right now that is

2010
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:26,960
being discussed in in articles and in in

2011
01:29:24,349 --> 01:29:31,610
the community is that the 700 that did

2012
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:34,840
not receive that first permit would

2013
01:29:31,609 --> 01:29:38,089
qualify immediately for either

2014
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:41,900
manufacturing distribution or delivery

2015
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:46,460
now if we were to turn on 700 delivery

2016
01:29:41,899 --> 01:29:48,828
licenses you know this year that that's

2017
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:52,130
a game-changer and that could be the

2018
01:29:48,828 --> 01:29:55,939
number one way to try and compete with

2019
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:58,850
the illicit market it could be the one

2020
01:29:55,939 --> 01:30:04,069
thing that could change the fact that

2021
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:07,219
that la needs enforcement it could be

2022
01:30:04,069 --> 01:30:10,039
that we instead of enforcing you know

2023
01:30:07,219 --> 01:30:12,230
offer a way to compete and if that was

2024
01:30:10,039 --> 01:30:19,460
if that was coupled with some sort of

2025
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:22,459
equity easement of local taxes then that

2026
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:24,289
could possibly spur you know other

2027
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:26,239
jurisdictions to kind of follow suit

2028
01:30:24,289 --> 01:30:30,229
maybe making delivery and

2029
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:32,988
over-the-counter permit like like

2030
01:30:30,229 --> 01:30:35,829
someone else just said before me making

2031
01:30:32,988 --> 01:30:37,879
sure that that that delivery license is

2032
01:30:35,829 --> 01:30:39,289
compatible with with all the state

2033
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:41,810
requirements and then just giving them

2034
01:30:39,289 --> 01:30:43,069
an over-the-counter permit locally you

2035
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:45,590
know that that could change everything

2036
01:30:43,069 --> 01:30:47,779
and since we are an essential business

2037
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:51,110
you know I'm really hoping that we see

2038
01:30:47,779 --> 01:30:53,448
some big win for for the cannabis

2039
01:30:51,109 --> 01:31:01,069
industry that that comes out of this

2040
01:30:53,448 --> 01:31:03,948
crisis I'm gonna tu oh so just quickly I

2041
01:31:01,069 --> 01:31:06,289
mean when Jackie mentions delivery it's

2042
01:31:03,948 --> 01:31:09,439
almost as if we're aspiring to act like

2043
01:31:06,289 --> 01:31:12,710
every other type of product like we all

2044
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:14,779
order stuff from Amazon I think Co bid

2045
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:17,810
is kind of putting delivering the

2046
01:31:14,779 --> 01:31:21,198
spotlight in a positive way so Greg can

2047
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:23,360
you talk about your are you doing any

2048
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:24,859
delivery or do you have aspirations or

2049
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:27,679
what's your delivery route is your going

2050
01:31:24,859 --> 01:31:31,460
forward we are and we actually started

2051
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:33,800
pretty much with our delivery so like I

2052
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:35,539
had said earlier like I'm licensed and

2053
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:38,570
phase one since the beginning our stores

2054
01:31:35,539 --> 01:31:40,430
been around since five micro-business I

2055
01:31:38,569 --> 01:31:42,170
have three phase two licenses

2056
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:45,829
cultivation manufacturing distribution

2057
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:48,940
and we got one of the 100 phase 3 social

2058
01:31:45,829 --> 01:31:54,590
equity licenses as well so I mean

2059
01:31:48,939 --> 01:31:57,169
ability I do not believe that having 700

2060
01:31:54,590 --> 01:32:01,670
delivery licenses come online will help

2061
01:31:57,170 --> 01:32:04,789
anything at all l I'm doing delivery the

2062
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:07,460
max I get is 20 to 30 I don't even know

2063
01:32:04,789 --> 01:32:08,850
how the next 100 social equity licenses

2064
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:11,250
which the audit was complete

2065
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:12,780
and found that it's good to go so we are

2066
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:16,470
gonna be moving forward with the issuing

2067
01:32:12,779 --> 01:32:18,479
licenses for the 100 we did get that

2068
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:21,750
email so that's a done deal there is no

2069
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:25,289
more argument there and so but the thing

2070
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:27,060
is is I feel the hundred social equity

2071
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:29,760
licenses that are coming online they're

2072
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:31,980
gonna fail first of all they don't have

2073
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,630
the contacts well unless they're

2074
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:36,299
partnered with somebody like myself

2075
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:38,310
who's experienced in hella who has the

2076
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:40,710
contacts and connections a lot of

2077
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:43,050
manufacturers and distributors and Flo

2078
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:45,510
Connor couldn't attest to this they

2079
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:48,329
don't have too much product left for new

2080
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:51,000
retailers I go on the website of Flo

2081
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:53,340
kana and it's almost always sold out of

2082
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,289
a lot of stuff and that they're not the

2083
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:58,920
only ones there's a lot of distributors

2084
01:32:55,289 --> 01:33:00,750
that are already at their max capacity

2085
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:04,350
with the retailers that they already

2086
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:06,979
work with so a lot of these new

2087
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:12,210
businesses coming online who have zero

2088
01:33:06,979 --> 01:33:15,239
reputation zero contacts with or n

2089
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:17,279
relationships with vendors good luck

2090
01:33:15,239 --> 01:33:18,929
getting anything on consignment and that

2091
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:20,639
goes to the point that Jackie had made

2092
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:22,530
in the very beginning where eight

2093
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:24,360
people's AR books are out of control

2094
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:26,309
because people aren't paying so they're

2095
01:33:24,359 --> 01:33:28,500
already too paranoid to do anymore

2096
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:30,860
consignment because they've already had

2097
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:34,680
that taste and it doesn't taste it right

2098
01:33:30,859 --> 01:33:37,529
and and and so you're gonna have a lot

2099
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:41,130
of businesses coming online and Bailey

2100
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:43,409
and my thing has always been is I don't

2101
01:33:41,130 --> 01:33:45,600
want to set up anybody for failure I

2102
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:47,819
want to set them up for success and if

2103
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,680
it takes a little longer to do that then

2104
01:33:47,819 --> 01:33:53,579
let it take a little longer let's do it

2105
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:57,180
right but to rush into and jump into and

2106
01:33:53,579 --> 01:33:59,880
just do licensing and then and then what

2107
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:02,869
what did we miss all what did we really

2108
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:05,670
achieve other than having these people

2109
01:34:02,869 --> 01:34:08,069
who are just thrown into a situation

2110
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:10,829
they don't know anything about metric I

2111
01:34:08,069 --> 01:34:11,219
pay my metric compliance officer 6,000 a

2112
01:34:10,829 --> 01:34:13,769
month

2113
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:16,740
how are these social equity people gonna

2114
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:18,750
afford that good luck and then metric

2115
01:34:16,739 --> 01:34:20,609
the amount of times it goes offline and

2116
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:21,748
then you can't even get product onto the

2117
01:34:20,609 --> 01:34:23,728
floor because you have to wait

2118
01:34:21,748 --> 01:34:27,528
hours and hours until it comes back

2119
01:34:23,729 --> 01:34:31,708
online you know if there is so many

2120
01:34:27,529 --> 01:34:35,359
intricacies and nuances that really have

2121
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:38,838
to be you have to create a social equity

2122
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:42,569
education and mentorship program for

2123
01:34:38,838 --> 01:34:44,818
success or else you could get hand-up

2124
01:34:42,569 --> 01:34:45,949
thousands of licenses and they're all

2125
01:34:44,819 --> 01:34:49,319
gonna fail

2126
01:34:45,948 --> 01:34:53,158
okay we expand about a metric a little

2127
01:34:49,319 --> 01:34:55,769
bit here others my fear is that metric

2128
01:34:53,158 --> 01:34:58,618
is an auditing the tsunami waiting to

2129
01:34:55,769 --> 01:35:00,059
happen for a lot of people can people

2130
01:34:58,618 --> 01:35:01,978
just kind of weigh in on their

2131
01:35:00,059 --> 01:35:07,469
perspectives and their experiences with

2132
01:35:01,979 --> 01:35:09,149
metric I could wait to somebody I mean

2133
01:35:07,469 --> 01:35:11,698
the mining stop my experience has been

2134
01:35:09,149 --> 01:35:13,499
insane be as a retailer we deal with a

2135
01:35:11,698 --> 01:35:15,628
lot more like on the distribution side

2136
01:35:13,498 --> 01:35:17,849
it's easy we only have a handful of line

2137
01:35:15,628 --> 01:35:20,878
items but on the retail side we have

2138
01:35:17,849 --> 01:35:24,809
over two thousand line items and then we

2139
01:35:20,878 --> 01:35:28,078
get one order in from a one distributor

2140
01:35:24,809 --> 01:35:31,708
and you have 60 different COAS you have

2141
01:35:28,078 --> 01:35:33,958
to enter all of those in and it's it's

2142
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:36,748
it's really a mess like before we would

2143
01:35:33,958 --> 01:35:38,429
get a product in medical days you get

2144
01:35:36,748 --> 01:35:39,988
the product and you pay for it you get

2145
01:35:38,429 --> 01:35:43,378
the bag you can just throw the bag on

2146
01:35:39,988 --> 01:35:45,118
the shelf and start selling it now we're

2147
01:35:43,378 --> 01:35:47,128
like oh we hope to be able to get it on

2148
01:35:45,118 --> 01:35:50,608
the shelf on the same day and we hope

2149
01:35:47,128 --> 01:35:52,979
that metric is online you know so it's a

2150
01:35:50,609 --> 01:35:58,949
huge problem and it's a huge bottleneck

2151
01:35:52,979 --> 01:36:01,469
for the entire industry you know as a

2152
01:35:58,948 --> 01:36:05,308
distributor trying to get samples out to

2153
01:36:01,469 --> 01:36:07,319
retailers we've got you know 25 30 SKUs

2154
01:36:05,309 --> 01:36:12,359
that means someone has to go and

2155
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:14,489
individually tag single items 25 30 per

2156
01:36:12,359 --> 01:36:19,169
retailer we want to send a package out

2157
01:36:14,488 --> 01:36:21,928
to yeah and what's the benefit are we

2158
01:36:19,168 --> 01:36:25,648
keeping children safer by having 30

2159
01:36:21,929 --> 01:36:27,359
metric tags go out on samples you know

2160
01:36:25,649 --> 01:36:28,979
there's got to be a wet better way to

2161
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:31,919
handle some of that it should not take

2162
01:36:28,979 --> 01:36:33,090
my fulfillment manager two hours to put

2163
01:36:31,918 --> 01:36:36,719
together a sample

2164
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:39,719
then have to put it in a ban and you

2165
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:41,849
know it cost us three four five hundred

2166
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:48,210
dollars to get samples out to a retailer

2167
01:36:41,849 --> 01:36:51,630
now speaking to Shannon's point about

2168
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:54,448
the samples yeah we were experiencing

2169
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:57,569
the same thing so we worked to get a

2170
01:36:54,448 --> 01:37:00,598
bill introduced trade samples bill that

2171
01:36:57,569 --> 01:37:03,118
would allow distributors to give samples

2172
01:37:00,599 --> 01:37:05,569
to retailers without having to go

2173
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:09,238
through all of that craziness and and

2174
01:37:05,569 --> 01:37:12,420
designate certain product as sample not

2175
01:37:09,238 --> 01:37:14,158
for resale and so that is again you know

2176
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:15,868
one of those things where it was like oh

2177
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:17,189
this seems like an easy fix no one's

2178
01:37:15,868 --> 01:37:20,250
really gonna have a problem with this

2179
01:37:17,189 --> 01:37:28,379
and then it gets stuck right now it's

2180
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:30,840
stuck because of Kovan for some

2181
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:33,539
immediate relief and the supply chain

2182
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:36,449
that you know if it buys us five ten

2183
01:37:33,539 --> 01:37:38,368
hours 20 hours a week and labor costs

2184
01:37:36,448 --> 01:37:41,488
like that's the difference between some

2185
01:37:38,368 --> 01:37:43,049
people surviving absolutely and I think

2186
01:37:41,488 --> 01:37:45,299
that you know and you know Nicole's not

2187
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:47,039
on anymore but I think part of the

2188
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:49,170
frustration I think that the end that I

2189
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:51,300
feel coming from the industry is that

2190
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:54,510
the super controversial things like

2191
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:56,369
eliminating taxes and the super not

2192
01:37:54,510 --> 01:37:59,130
controversial things like allowing

2193
01:37:56,368 --> 01:38:01,439
distributors to designate samples seem

2194
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:03,569
to have the same hold up like they do

2195
01:38:01,439 --> 01:38:05,908
it's not like I don't have confidence

2196
01:38:03,569 --> 01:38:08,488
that giving them something that's

2197
01:38:05,908 --> 01:38:10,109
completely budget neutral totally in the

2198
01:38:08,488 --> 01:38:12,000
context of covent everything they say

2199
01:38:10,109 --> 01:38:14,460
they want that anything's gonna happen

2200
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,250
because I feel like we're putting forth

2201
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:19,109
all kinds of ideas and all kinds of

2202
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:21,539
suggestions and regulatory fixes from

2203
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:24,179
the very very big and profound to the

2204
01:38:21,539 --> 01:38:27,779
very very small and everything is

2205
01:38:24,179 --> 01:38:29,489
getting stopped and so that makes it

2206
01:38:27,779 --> 01:38:31,229
really difficult and to be honest

2207
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:33,779
sometimes the industry is its own worst

2208
01:38:31,229 --> 01:38:36,029
enemy and you know we have to understand

2209
01:38:33,779 --> 01:38:37,829
what incrementalism is and that not

2210
01:38:36,029 --> 01:38:40,319
everything is going to be a vehicle for

2211
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:43,050
everyone so if we submit something

2212
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:45,750
allowing distributors to give samples to

2213
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:46,920
retailers you know there may be parts of

2214
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,149
the supply chain that are

2215
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:50,399
included in that but this is a

2216
01:38:48,149 --> 01:38:53,309
low-hanging fruit like let's get this

2217
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:55,289
show that it's benefiting us and then we

2218
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:57,060
can go back and say look it benefited

2219
01:38:55,289 --> 01:38:58,710
the distributor so much let's have it

2220
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:00,960
benefit the cultivators let's have it

2221
01:38:58,710 --> 01:39:02,789
benefit the manufacturers but the

2222
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,859
problem is is that folks are so afraid

2223
01:39:02,789 --> 01:39:06,869
of what's happening which I totally

2224
01:39:04,859 --> 01:39:09,149
understand that they don't want to get

2225
01:39:06,869 --> 01:39:11,729
left behind and so they feel this need

2226
01:39:09,149 --> 01:39:14,039
to be included and involved in every

2227
01:39:11,729 --> 01:39:16,169
step of the way when sometimes that's

2228
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:18,390
what's holding us back because we and

2229
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:20,520
then appear to legislators to not know

2230
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:22,829
what we want that they're not gonna be

2231
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:24,420
able to make us happy that whatever they

2232
01:39:22,829 --> 01:39:26,130
do is gonna be the wrong thing and

2233
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:27,810
that's not the kind of situation you

2234
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:29,069
want to put legislators in you want them

2235
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:30,750
to think that they're gonna sign this

2236
01:39:29,069 --> 01:39:32,759
and everyone's in a clap for them and

2237
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:34,380
give them a pat on the back and I just

2238
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:38,159
don't think the industry's given them

2239
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:39,960
one of those situations except taxes you

2240
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:41,430
know eliminating the cultivation tax

2241
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:44,100
would be the easiest thing in the world

2242
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:47,220
for them to do and not get the pushback

2243
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:48,810
and let it be a sign of good faith that

2244
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:53,280
they really do want this industry to

2245
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:56,220
succeed yeah and you know one thing

2246
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:57,509
about the cultivation tax that I when we

2247
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:59,280
were speaking about that that I don't

2248
01:39:57,510 --> 01:40:03,659
think was mentioned earlier is you know

2249
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:07,229
they they tax US per clone you know for

2250
01:40:03,659 --> 01:40:08,849
every clone we make we get taxed and I

2251
01:40:07,229 --> 01:40:10,609
don't know any and you know they keep

2252
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:13,770
talking about how we're like agriculture

2253
01:40:10,609 --> 01:40:16,589
you know but I don't I don't go to a

2254
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:19,320
nursery and I don't see the nursery guy

2255
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:21,989
making clones of his succulents getting

2256
01:40:19,319 --> 01:40:23,909
charged her succulent attacks you know

2257
01:40:21,989 --> 01:40:25,079
can you imagine if you did that all hell

2258
01:40:23,909 --> 01:40:26,970
would break loose what do you mean I

2259
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:31,019
gotta pay every time I make a clone off

2260
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:33,300
of my plants or you know it's ridiculous

2261
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:34,950
it's that that it's the most asinine

2262
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:37,500
thing I've ever heard that we have to be

2263
01:40:34,949 --> 01:40:39,359
every time I make a clone off of my own

2264
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:42,750
plant I have to pay a tax

2265
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:45,089
it's insane well part of that issue is

2266
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:47,430
because cannabis in California is

2267
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:50,670
considered an agricultural product and

2268
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:52,440
not agriculture so even when that clone

2269
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:55,170
is can stack load is considered a

2270
01:40:52,439 --> 01:40:57,299
product and products are taxed like wine

2271
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:59,940
is an agricultural product and it's

2272
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:02,340
taxed though grapes are a taxed

2273
01:40:59,939 --> 01:41:04,139
but the product is and so the problem is

2274
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:06,090
that we don't have a designation for

2275
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:09,300
cannabis and it's raw plant for him to

2276
01:41:06,090 --> 01:41:11,730
just be agriculture and if we did it was

2277
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:14,369
just agriculture then we wouldn't be

2278
01:41:11,729 --> 01:41:16,859
applying the taxes to it now of course

2279
01:41:14,369 --> 01:41:18,059
well one of the rubs right is that one

2280
01:41:16,859 --> 01:41:19,920
of the things we're finding that's a big

2281
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:21,960
pain in the ass about the industry is

2282
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,880
the multiple agencies that are involved

2283
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:26,220
in the duplication of things that you

2284
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:28,199
have to do for your you know compliance

2285
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:30,030
for this agency in this agency so one of

2286
01:41:28,199 --> 01:41:31,619
the recommendations that was made that

2287
01:41:30,029 --> 01:41:34,109
the governor's office is considering is

2288
01:41:31,619 --> 01:41:35,819
consolidation and bringing all of the

2289
01:41:34,109 --> 01:41:37,739
cannabis activities under the Bureau of

2290
01:41:35,819 --> 01:41:39,539
cannabis control now this is a

2291
01:41:37,739 --> 01:41:41,429
double-edged sword because on the one

2292
01:41:39,539 --> 01:41:43,470
hand yeah it'd be great to just have one

2293
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:45,539
agency's rule that you had to follow

2294
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:48,090
instead of sometimes conflicting rules

2295
01:41:45,539 --> 01:41:50,659
coming from two agencies but on the

2296
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:53,369
other hand it takes cannabis out of CDFA

2297
01:41:50,659 --> 01:41:55,529
so there's a concern that that is gonna

2298
01:41:53,369 --> 01:41:58,470
separate cannabis from agriculture even

2299
01:41:55,529 --> 01:42:00,119
further if the plant is no longer

2300
01:41:58,470 --> 01:42:11,600
regulated by the department of food and

2301
01:42:00,119 --> 01:42:13,829
a good soul

2302
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:15,750
industry we really have to think about

2303
01:42:13,829 --> 01:42:18,329
what we want cannabis to look like ten

2304
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:20,189
years from now and work towards that so

2305
01:42:18,329 --> 01:42:21,899
if we want it to be an agricultural crop

2306
01:42:20,189 --> 01:42:23,669
with farmers markets and interstate

2307
01:42:21,899 --> 01:42:26,189
commerce and being treated like the wine

2308
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:28,170
industry of California we should set our

2309
01:42:26,189 --> 01:42:29,699
sights on that and I really do think

2310
01:42:28,170 --> 01:42:31,590
that's a good model even though I don't

2311
01:42:29,699 --> 01:42:34,639
like to compare cannabis to alcohol as

2312
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:37,199
an industry the California wine industry

2313
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:39,210
really does make a lot of sense in terms

2314
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:40,769
of the Appalachians and the branding and

2315
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:43,170
the tourism and everything that comes

2316
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:45,390
along with that for them to aspire to

2317
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:47,489
have their California cannabis be right

2318
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:50,250
alongside with that California wine and

2319
01:42:47,489 --> 01:42:52,859
we had during non kovat times we have

2320
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:56,100
thousands of buses a day going from cal

2321
01:42:52,859 --> 01:42:58,469
francisco to wine country and the state

2322
01:42:56,100 --> 01:43:00,000
makes a ton of money on that the the

2323
01:42:58,470 --> 01:43:01,590
industries make a ton of money on that

2324
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,239
so why shouldn't we have thousands of

2325
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:05,489
buses leaving San Francisco every day to

2326
01:43:03,239 --> 01:43:07,139
come to the Emerald triangle you know

2327
01:43:05,489 --> 01:43:09,420
again I go back to those missed

2328
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:11,039
opportunities you know because we still

2329
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:13,079
think we're don't want to encourage

2330
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:13,859
cannabis use and that's really getting

2331
01:43:13,079 --> 01:43:15,600
in the way

2332
01:43:13,859 --> 01:43:17,969
letting this industry flourish in the

2333
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:19,619
way that it should and you know I just

2334
01:43:17,969 --> 01:43:21,779
want to get to that point because you

2335
01:43:19,618 --> 01:43:24,559
said the taking of the buses to wine

2336
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:28,198
country which is something else that as

2337
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:30,539
cultivators and even manufacturers we're

2338
01:43:28,198 --> 01:43:33,379
not allowed to do we can't do cannabis

2339
01:43:30,539 --> 01:43:36,329
the cannabis tourism we can't have

2340
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:39,300
someone come and give them a tour the

2341
01:43:36,329 --> 01:43:42,059
facility and then later on go and

2342
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:43,829
purchase products from the retailer that

2343
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:45,900
it we're not allowed to do that even

2344
01:43:43,829 --> 01:43:48,510
though my other property that's how we

2345
01:43:45,899 --> 01:43:51,059
set it up with the grow the

2346
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:53,610
manufacturing distro and the retail all

2347
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:54,960
there on the same property they're not

2348
01:43:53,609 --> 01:43:57,179
going to allow us to do that and that's

2349
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:59,219
a big hit like you said because that's a

2350
01:43:57,179 --> 01:44:09,630
lot of money in the cat into tourism

2351
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:12,480
I have a question um do you guys think

2352
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:15,239
that the that the it California says the

2353
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:17,879
California industry is on the same page

2354
01:44:15,238 --> 01:44:23,099
about what it wants to look like in ten

2355
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:25,889
years now yeah I just want to add on

2356
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:28,320
that you know I it's the industry is in

2357
01:44:25,889 --> 01:44:33,319
a patchwork too and I have a note here

2358
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:36,179
perception of of wealth and I think that

2359
01:44:33,319 --> 01:44:40,259
depending on who you're talking to their

2360
01:44:36,179 --> 01:44:43,500
perception of the industry is is is

2361
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:45,869
unique to them I I've done this a lot

2362
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:47,488
talk to people down in LA retailers

2363
01:44:45,868 --> 01:44:49,679
where's all the money and they go the

2364
01:44:47,488 --> 01:44:51,839
growers up nor if you talk to growers up

2365
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:53,969
north where's all the money and they

2366
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:56,969
point fingers down to retailers and

2367
01:44:53,969 --> 01:44:59,579
they're like two separate entities also

2368
01:44:56,969 --> 01:45:01,739
there is myriad number of trade groups

2369
01:44:59,579 --> 01:45:04,079
throughout the state I've never seen in

2370
01:45:01,738 --> 01:45:08,309
industry with so many trade groups that

2371
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:11,238
pop up out of necessity in geographic

2372
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:14,760
areas representing a swath of different

2373
01:45:11,238 --> 01:45:17,939
businesses rather than setting up trade

2374
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:20,520
groups that represent you know specific

2375
01:45:17,939 --> 01:45:21,149
areas of business which might make more

2376
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:24,480
sense

2377
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:27,269
I'm not criticizing it I'm just it just

2378
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:30,809
seems to be really piecemeal and arrests

2379
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:34,710
p for disparate voices and so then who

2380
01:45:30,810 --> 01:45:37,170
is the state listening to and you know

2381
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:39,439
how how do we how do we get on the same

2382
01:45:37,170 --> 01:45:39,440
page

2383
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:44,670
well I think the reason that the

2384
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:46,980
organizational situation is what it is

2385
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:49,230
is just because of the growth so you

2386
01:45:46,979 --> 01:45:51,929
know when before we were in industry it

2387
01:45:49,229 --> 01:45:53,189
was like the consumers and then the

2388
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:55,260
people that were providing to the

2389
01:45:53,189 --> 01:45:58,529
consumers and those were two groups and

2390
01:45:55,260 --> 01:46:00,360
they were represented by like normal and

2391
01:45:58,529 --> 01:46:02,460
Americans for safe access on the

2392
01:46:00,359 --> 01:46:04,559
consumer side and then on the people

2393
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:06,960
serving the consumer side you had you

2394
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:08,520
know like Marijuana Policy Project and

2395
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,500
drug policy Alliance because they

2396
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:13,260
weren't businesses yet so the people

2397
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:14,899
representing the the industry were

2398
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:17,489
really representing the criminal justice

2399
01:46:14,899 --> 01:46:20,309
piece of that and the policy piece of

2400
01:46:17,489 --> 01:46:21,659
that we're much bigger now and so you

2401
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:22,950
know the example that I'll give it I'm

2402
01:46:21,659 --> 01:46:24,720
curious to hear what Jackie has to say

2403
01:46:22,949 --> 01:46:26,099
about this because I know that she does

2404
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:27,690
a lot of work with organizations and

2405
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:31,289
things a lot about realization of

2406
01:46:27,689 --> 01:46:32,789
politics well a few years ago I was

2407
01:46:31,289 --> 01:46:35,550
invited to speak at the alcohol

2408
01:46:32,789 --> 01:46:37,739
distributors conference and they have a

2409
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:40,440
huge conference just for alcohol

2410
01:46:37,739 --> 01:46:42,750
distributors and they have another huge

2411
01:46:40,439 --> 01:46:44,250
conference just for alcohol retailers

2412
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:47,670
and they have another huge conference

2413
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:49,319
just for the alcohol producers and they

2414
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:51,090
don't necessarily agree with each other

2415
01:46:49,319 --> 01:46:52,739
but what the retailers want isn't

2416
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:54,659
necessarily what the distributor's want

2417
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:57,389
isn't necessarily what the manufacturers

2418
01:46:54,659 --> 01:46:59,369
want but they don't all get together in

2419
01:46:57,390 --> 01:47:01,920
one room and try to figure out a path

2420
01:46:59,369 --> 01:47:03,029
but they all agree on and said they meet

2421
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,500
in their factions

2422
01:47:03,029 --> 01:47:06,809
and they decide what's best for their

2423
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:07,979
faction and then they sudden it is to

2424
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:10,050
talk about what that means as an

2425
01:47:07,979 --> 01:47:13,409
industry and I feel like we're in that

2426
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:15,570
awkward teenage phase between these two

2427
01:47:13,409 --> 01:47:17,159
worlds where we need to grow out of the

2428
01:47:15,569 --> 01:47:19,590
idea that we can have one umbrella

2429
01:47:17,159 --> 01:47:21,269
organization that represents accurately

2430
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:24,289
every sector of the cannabis industry

2431
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:26,850
and we need to start thinking more about

2432
01:47:24,289 --> 01:47:28,140
representation by sector which I think

2433
01:47:26,850 --> 01:47:30,900
you are seeing we have the California

2434
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:34,680
distributors Association we have

2435
01:47:30,899 --> 01:47:35,909
regional cultivation associations you

2436
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:38,369
know and I think that that's really

2437
01:47:35,909 --> 01:47:40,289
where we're headed because it's just

2438
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:42,210
getting too big for us to come together

2439
01:47:40,289 --> 01:47:45,210
and think that one Association is going

2440
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:48,000
to be able to accurately and fully

2441
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:52,439
represent the needs of out of all the

2442
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,970
members across sectors I can agree with

2443
01:47:52,439 --> 01:47:55,079
that that it's probably gonna end up

2444
01:47:53,970 --> 01:47:57,360
being

2445
01:47:55,079 --> 01:48:01,380
a few different ones but definitely not

2446
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:02,880
like 30 or 40 like we have now and that

2447
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:05,190
each section the distributors

2448
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:08,159
manufacturers cultivators retailers

2449
01:48:05,189 --> 01:48:10,919
eventually probably hopefully gets into

2450
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:13,590
only four and that will be a lot easier

2451
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:15,350
for you know when each perspectives

2452
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:19,380
board goes to meet with the other

2453
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:22,829
executive board you'll be uh less

2454
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:24,930
because I mean I I've been a part of so

2455
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:26,640
many trade organizations and helped

2456
01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:29,220
found so many California Growers

2457
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:31,170
Association Greater Los Angeles

2458
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:33,060
collectives Association which been

2459
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:36,230
around for ever was like the first

2460
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:39,230
cannabis trade organization I'm on

2461
01:48:36,229 --> 01:48:41,519
Southern California coalition

2462
01:48:39,229 --> 01:48:44,009
cultivators Alliance when we had started

2463
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:47,580
that in the beginning and it's just you

2464
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:49,350
know he gets he gets a little tiring you

2465
01:48:47,579 --> 01:48:51,600
know when you just all of these

2466
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:53,850
different organizations and then you

2467
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:57,120
help put them together some succeed some

2468
01:48:53,850 --> 01:49:00,510
fail some stick around some don't and so

2469
01:48:57,119 --> 01:49:03,510
for me just to see and just to have some

2470
01:49:00,510 --> 01:49:06,869
kind of unity on that forefront would be

2471
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:08,730
amazing and to have that message that

2472
01:49:06,869 --> 01:49:11,670
all of us even though we're separate

2473
01:49:08,729 --> 01:49:14,669
were together when it comes to certain

2474
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:17,970
messaging would resonate a lot further

2475
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:20,850
what our elected officials and in all

2476
01:49:17,970 --> 01:49:22,980
reality if they if they knew or even

2477
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:25,350
thought that we were all together like

2478
01:49:22,979 --> 01:49:27,439
we all because whenever it's a crisis we

2479
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:30,570
all come together really quick you know

2480
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:32,579
you know we could hit the crisis mode we

2481
01:49:30,569 --> 01:49:35,340
all come together we all form together

2482
01:49:32,579 --> 01:49:37,019
we get things done and resolved and then

2483
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:39,539
they see though everybody's off to the

2484
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:45,900
winds again which is what has happened

2485
01:49:39,539 --> 01:49:48,840
almost every time and so I would love to

2486
01:49:45,899 --> 01:49:50,759
see that not happen where we come

2487
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:55,680
together during crisis and we stay

2488
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:57,960
together and continue to progress

2489
01:49:55,680 --> 01:50:01,409
towards what we want was you know ten

2490
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:03,300
years from now whatever it may be but it

2491
01:50:01,409 --> 01:50:05,819
does get exhausting when you have so

2492
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:07,969
many different organizations and then

2493
01:50:05,819 --> 01:50:09,799
you it's like you're just playing

2494
01:50:07,969 --> 01:50:11,599
conference call after conference fall

2495
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:15,050
when we could all just get on one call

2496
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:16,578
and and get to the meat and potatoes if

2497
01:50:15,050 --> 01:50:19,909
you want to say of the subject and

2498
01:50:16,578 --> 01:50:22,549
actually get some real resolution and I

2499
01:50:19,908 --> 01:50:25,118
mean we la we're notorious for it down

2500
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:27,429
here it's like every year there's a new

2501
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:31,460
organization if not every three months

2502
01:50:27,429 --> 01:50:34,399
you know and it's because it we know we

2503
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:37,429
are very diverse and the diversity adds

2504
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:40,248
to that as well because every seems like

2505
01:50:37,429 --> 01:50:44,389
different also ethnic backgrounds have

2506
01:50:40,248 --> 01:50:47,689
their own organizations as well but

2507
01:50:44,389 --> 01:50:51,440
honestly trying to get it down to kind

2508
01:50:47,689 --> 01:50:56,089
of you know minimize that I think what

2509
01:50:51,439 --> 01:50:58,969
further are us in getting our message to

2510
01:50:56,090 --> 01:51:02,239
what we want to our officials to really

2511
01:50:58,969 --> 01:51:04,069
push forward our agenda which at the end

2512
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:06,738
of the day we all want the same thing I

2513
01:51:04,069 --> 01:51:08,738
truly believe that we all really want

2514
01:51:06,738 --> 01:51:14,178
the same thing which is just to be

2515
01:51:08,738 --> 01:51:16,759
treated like normal businesses and not

2516
01:51:14,179 --> 01:51:19,279
like third-class third-rate citizens

2517
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:22,400
which I'm kind of sick of you know I

2518
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:24,408
mean in 2008 I got a DA letter saying

2519
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:27,768
I'm gonna go to federal prison and I got

2520
01:51:24,408 --> 01:51:29,689
arrested in 2007 for 55 grams and they

2521
01:51:27,769 --> 01:51:32,179
try to give me three to five years for

2522
01:51:29,689 --> 01:51:35,149
less than two ounces and it's just I'm

2523
01:51:32,179 --> 01:51:37,639
just so tired of being treated okay

2524
01:51:35,149 --> 01:51:40,009
third class and all the amount of taxes

2525
01:51:37,639 --> 01:51:42,199
we give and it can you imagine if we

2526
01:51:40,010 --> 01:51:44,599
were in essentially businesses where

2527
01:51:42,198 --> 01:51:47,448
would that leave us we would all be

2528
01:51:44,599 --> 01:51:50,719
bankrupt because we don't get a bailout

2529
01:51:47,448 --> 01:51:54,469
so the whole thing and the whole

2530
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:56,300
thinking has to change because we are

2531
01:51:54,469 --> 01:51:58,908
citizens we are taxed members we are

2532
01:51:56,300 --> 01:52:03,440
fathers we are mothers we are we are

2533
01:51:58,908 --> 01:52:05,328
your average working-class the last of

2534
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:07,248
the middle class because this is where

2535
01:52:05,328 --> 01:52:11,299
we transitioned into because there was

2536
01:52:07,248 --> 01:52:15,498
no other jobs left you know and you know

2537
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:18,498
we are normal regular people and we

2538
01:52:15,498 --> 01:52:20,538
should be treated as such you know and

2539
01:52:18,498 --> 01:52:21,710
that's that's that's my thing and and

2540
01:52:20,538 --> 01:52:24,949
the sooner I think

2541
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:25,279
can all we're not all gonna come

2542
01:52:24,949 --> 01:52:27,079
together

2543
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:29,899
it's gonna be so but as long as we can

2544
01:52:27,079 --> 01:52:31,909
all come together in our own perspective

2545
01:52:29,899 --> 01:52:34,339
feels and then communicate with each

2546
01:52:31,909 --> 01:52:36,680
other I believe and that's where the

2547
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:38,420
Southern California Coalition is trying

2548
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:40,579
to make that happen we are trying to

2549
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:45,489
talk to different organizations about

2550
01:52:40,579 --> 01:52:48,500
whether it's on paper or just by word

2551
01:52:45,488 --> 01:52:50,988
coming together you know it's that

2552
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:53,930
appearance and that sends the message to

2553
01:52:50,988 --> 01:52:56,059
the officials that hey we're coming

2554
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:58,640
together and and we're gonna get this

2555
01:52:56,060 --> 01:53:00,650
together and you need to start paying

2556
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:03,410
even more attention to what we're saying

2557
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:05,869
because we're tired yeah it is

2558
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:07,699
exhausting and it doesn't feel good and

2559
01:53:05,869 --> 01:53:10,430
then you look at the liquor store down

2560
01:53:07,699 --> 01:53:13,519
the street who's paying only $1600 a

2561
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:16,310
year for his city tax and I'm paying of

2562
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:19,070
over a half a million and I'm getting

2563
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:22,340
treated worse it makes like zero cents

2564
01:53:19,069 --> 01:53:24,409
and and you know I could get into so

2565
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:26,029
many things you know I served in the

2566
01:53:24,409 --> 01:53:30,260
Marine Corps for seven and a half years

2567
01:53:26,029 --> 01:53:31,759
I got shot stabbed blown up and now I'm

2568
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:35,090
getting treated like a third class

2569
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:38,239
citizen when there is someone who

2570
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:40,159
migrated here three years ago who has a

2571
01:53:38,238 --> 01:53:41,299
liquor store and is getting treated

2572
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:44,000
better than I am

2573
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:46,520
when I sacrificed almost my life for my

2574
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:49,609
country so it doesn't make sense you

2575
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:52,360
know it doesn't make sense it and we

2576
01:53:49,609 --> 01:53:55,429
need to get our officials to to start

2577
01:53:52,359 --> 01:53:57,829
having more common sense and and looking

2578
01:53:55,430 --> 01:54:00,020
at us and preceding us in a much

2579
01:53:57,829 --> 01:54:05,269
different way than what has been in the

2580
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:10,489
past Tom thank you for pressing that

2581
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:12,739
question by articulating that there's 30

2582
01:54:10,488 --> 01:54:15,199
or 40 groups at a necessity like that's

2583
01:54:12,738 --> 01:54:18,259
that to me is really important there are

2584
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:20,899
30 to 40 groups out of necessity out of

2585
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:22,250
whatever their issue is that they've

2586
01:54:20,899 --> 01:54:24,799
come together for whether it be

2587
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:27,710
manufacturing or retail or cultivation

2588
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:34,730
or patient access whatever it is you

2589
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:35,439
know um and I think that you know in my

2590
01:54:34,729 --> 01:54:37,119
eye

2591
01:54:35,439 --> 01:54:39,189
I think it's been like five years that

2592
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:42,219
I've been in this industry now and I

2593
01:54:39,189 --> 01:54:43,960
can't tell you how many people how many

2594
01:54:42,219 --> 01:54:45,869
regulators the legislators and

2595
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:49,960
politicians have asked me this question

2596
01:54:45,869 --> 01:54:51,819
do you have an NRA of cannabis and every

2597
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:53,680
time I'm like no we don't have an NRA of

2598
01:54:51,819 --> 01:54:55,869
cannabis no we don't have a Consumer

2599
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:57,670
Association no we don't have anybody you

2600
01:54:55,869 --> 01:55:00,579
know working at the federal level

2601
01:54:57,670 --> 01:55:03,159
representing consumers but I'm anybody

2602
01:55:00,579 --> 01:55:04,988
at state level representing consumers we

2603
01:55:03,159 --> 01:55:08,069
have niche little organizations

2604
01:55:04,988 --> 01:55:10,689
representing factions of consumers

2605
01:55:08,069 --> 01:55:14,170
normal you know probably being the one

2606
01:55:10,689 --> 01:55:17,469
most recognized Americans for safe

2607
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:20,230
access being the most recognized for

2608
01:55:17,469 --> 01:55:23,469
patients and their access we've never

2609
01:55:20,229 --> 01:55:25,869
had a consumer association someone as

2610
01:55:23,469 --> 01:55:30,550
powerful at an organization as powerful

2611
01:55:25,869 --> 01:55:35,859
as that the NRA and that might be what

2612
01:55:30,550 --> 01:55:37,659
we need um we I think that that if if

2613
01:55:35,859 --> 01:55:40,149
all of our operators throughout the

2614
01:55:37,659 --> 01:55:42,039
entire supply chain were to forget about

2615
01:55:40,149 --> 01:55:44,349
their operator hat for a second and

2616
01:55:42,039 --> 01:55:46,600
remember that most of them are consumers

2617
01:55:44,350 --> 01:55:50,079
I would say you know a very high

2618
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:52,329
majority of them are consumers and what

2619
01:55:50,079 --> 01:55:55,180
is it like to be a consumer in this

2620
01:55:52,329 --> 01:55:58,210
marketplace and for me I'm constantly

2621
01:55:55,180 --> 01:56:01,869
frustrated as a consumer on a daily

2622
01:55:58,210 --> 01:56:05,489
basis of you know when I find a product

2623
01:56:01,869 --> 01:56:09,059
in California that I like I can I

2624
01:56:05,488 --> 01:56:11,948
struggle to find it in multiple retail

2625
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:13,989
establishments I struggle to find it at

2626
01:56:11,948 --> 01:56:17,589
the same price point in multiple retail

2627
01:56:13,988 --> 01:56:19,899
establishments I'm usually not able to

2628
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:21,850
find it in Northern California and in

2629
01:56:19,899 --> 01:56:23,349
Southern California and I think that

2630
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:27,640
that is the type of problem that's going

2631
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:30,280
to get worse as the industry does evolve

2632
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:33,039
and if we evolved without any policy

2633
01:56:30,279 --> 01:56:35,649
reform we're gonna see more of a

2634
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:37,439
segregated market because the only

2635
01:56:35,649 --> 01:56:40,179
operators that really are able to

2636
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:42,939
weather this storm are the vertically

2637
01:56:40,180 --> 01:56:45,550
integrated ones and the more vertically

2638
01:56:42,939 --> 01:56:47,409
integrated you become the less likely

2639
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:49,269
you are to sell other people's products

2640
01:56:47,409 --> 01:56:51,729
right because you're not incentive

2641
01:56:49,269 --> 01:56:54,399
- you're you're trying to survive and I

2642
01:56:51,729 --> 01:56:57,668
get it I understand why the market looks

2643
01:56:54,399 --> 01:57:00,249
this way but for me every time I find a

2644
01:56:57,668 --> 01:57:03,578
product that I like I struggle to get

2645
01:57:00,248 --> 01:57:05,679
more of it and so I really think that

2646
01:57:03,578 --> 01:57:08,528
maybe we could all come together and

2647
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:10,809
it's been really playing in the back of

2648
01:57:08,529 --> 01:57:13,419
my line during this entire Kobe crisis

2649
01:57:10,809 --> 01:57:15,849
do we need an NRA of cannabis do we need

2650
01:57:13,418 --> 01:57:18,608
you know a consumer association I know I

2651
01:57:15,849 --> 01:57:20,439
would pay a hundred bucks a year to

2652
01:57:18,609 --> 01:57:23,260
belong to an association that told me

2653
01:57:20,439 --> 01:57:24,878
who my cannabis friendly politicians

2654
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:26,619
were to vote for if someone did that

2655
01:57:24,878 --> 01:57:29,229
work for me that would be worth a

2656
01:57:26,618 --> 01:57:31,538
hundred bucks a year for me you know

2657
01:57:29,229 --> 01:57:34,389
somebody that was an organization that

2658
01:57:31,538 --> 01:57:36,938
was working on rectifying the fact that

2659
01:57:34,389 --> 01:57:39,639
I have a problem that I can't find my

2660
01:57:36,939 --> 01:57:42,399
favorite edible in more than you know

2661
01:57:39,639 --> 01:57:45,219
three areas of the state that to me is

2662
01:57:42,399 --> 01:57:47,709
an issue and I don't think that we've

2663
01:57:45,219 --> 01:57:51,010
ever come at this from a consumer lens

2664
01:57:47,708 --> 01:57:53,528
and taken the consumers perspective you

2665
01:57:51,010 --> 01:57:55,628
know into consideration and you know if

2666
01:57:53,529 --> 01:57:57,429
there were if there were an in our NRA

2667
01:57:55,628 --> 01:57:59,469
of cannabis they'd be at the Capitol

2668
01:57:57,429 --> 01:58:01,748
right now saying this is ridiculous we

2669
01:57:59,469 --> 01:58:03,099
can't pay forty five percent more for

2670
01:58:01,748 --> 01:58:05,378
the same product we bought two and a

2671
01:58:03,099 --> 01:58:09,279
half years ago with our bongs and

2672
01:58:05,378 --> 01:58:11,019
instead of guns but I know I don't want

2673
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:13,269
to take up too much more time on this I

2674
01:58:11,019 --> 01:58:15,609
know that our panel is supposed to be

2675
01:58:13,269 --> 01:58:17,289
done right now but there are a few more

2676
01:58:15,609 --> 01:58:19,359
hot topics that Peter wanted to talk

2677
01:58:17,288 --> 01:58:20,978
about so I think we should probably do a

2678
01:58:19,359 --> 01:58:23,260
check in with everyone to see if

2679
01:58:20,979 --> 01:58:24,729
everyone can stick around and what Peter

2680
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:28,029
is thinking about how much longer he

2681
01:58:24,729 --> 01:58:29,979
wants to take I could stick around I

2682
01:58:28,029 --> 01:58:31,539
just have to take care of one thing but

2683
01:58:29,979 --> 01:58:34,119
you did make a great point and I think

2684
01:58:31,538 --> 01:58:36,398
there has to be a consumer organization

2685
01:58:34,118 --> 01:58:39,488
because every time we've done anything

2686
01:58:36,399 --> 01:58:40,359
on initiatives or referendums or

2687
01:58:39,488 --> 01:58:42,698
anything we've done

2688
01:58:40,359 --> 01:58:45,699
and speaking of Americans for saying

2689
01:58:42,698 --> 01:58:48,278
we've always thought about for the

2690
01:58:45,698 --> 01:58:50,168
patient's for the consumer this is

2691
01:58:48,279 --> 01:58:52,299
what's always our message and that's

2692
01:58:50,168 --> 01:58:54,338
what I've heard rest us so far because

2693
01:58:52,298 --> 01:58:57,969
those elected officials they care more

2694
01:58:54,338 --> 01:58:59,859
about the consumer then what they think

2695
01:58:57,969 --> 01:59:01,418
is the wealthy cannabis business one

2696
01:58:59,859 --> 01:59:02,110
even though they need to just look at

2697
01:59:01,418 --> 01:59:06,430
our books and

2698
01:59:02,109 --> 01:59:07,869
realize we're not wealthy and if they

2699
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:09,159
don't care because they for us they

2700
01:59:07,869 --> 01:59:10,689
think oh they're just complaining cuz

2701
01:59:09,159 --> 01:59:13,479
they're not making enough money but when

2702
01:59:10,689 --> 01:59:16,629
the consumer says something it drives

2703
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:20,349
that message a lot further and coming

2704
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:22,869
from us well that's the reason why we

2705
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:26,560
did this this banking campaign and

2706
01:59:22,869 --> 01:59:28,630
that's consumer facing so you know we I

2707
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:29,950
totally agree and I think that's one of

2708
01:59:28,630 --> 01:59:32,199
the things that's really been missing

2709
01:59:29,949 --> 01:59:34,329
post legalization is bringing the

2710
01:59:32,199 --> 01:59:36,039
consumers into the discussion prior to

2711
01:59:34,329 --> 01:59:38,439
legalization consumers were like our

2712
01:59:36,039 --> 01:59:39,699
biggest asset I mean they were making a

2713
01:59:38,439 --> 01:59:41,169
stink they didn't want to go to jail

2714
01:59:39,699 --> 01:59:42,880
they wanted access to product they

2715
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:44,770
wanted access to things that were tested

2716
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:45,960
I mean they really had a lot to say and

2717
01:59:44,770 --> 01:59:47,770
then I think after legalization

2718
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:50,500
unfortunately there was this idea of

2719
01:59:47,770 --> 01:59:53,860
like okay the businesses have it now you

2720
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:56,050
guys are good and we kind of lost some

2721
01:59:53,859 --> 01:59:57,579
of that from the consumer so you know

2722
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:59,980
one of the big issues I think we need to

2723
01:59:57,579 --> 02:00:01,659
fix is banking the fact that cannabis

2724
01:59:59,979 --> 02:00:03,579
businesses don't have access to banking

2725
02:00:01,659 --> 02:00:05,559
I mean obviously that's a big issue for

2726
02:00:03,579 --> 02:00:06,989
us as businesses but for the consumer

2727
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:09,100
what it means is you have to pay cash

2728
02:00:06,989 --> 02:00:11,139
you have to pay cash at the dispensary

2729
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:13,420
dispensary workers have to handle cash

2730
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:14,920
and given the current environment that

2731
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:16,989
we're in we were like hey this is

2732
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:19,449
something that consumers I myself as a

2733
02:00:16,989 --> 02:00:21,099
consumer but worries me I don't want to

2734
02:00:19,449 --> 02:00:23,019
have to use cash every time I go to a

2735
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:24,579
dispensary and my brother manages

2736
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:26,620
dispensaries and I don't want him to

2737
02:00:24,579 --> 02:00:28,000
have to handle cash every day and then

2738
02:00:26,619 --> 02:00:31,059
go home to his one and a half year old

2739
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:32,649
daughter so we thought this is something

2740
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:34,660
that consumers to get behind so we

2741
02:00:32,649 --> 02:00:37,599
started this dirty money campaign aimed

2742
02:00:34,659 --> 02:00:39,569
at getting the safe banking act included

2743
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:43,210
in the next federal Kogan relief

2744
02:00:39,569 --> 02:00:45,069
stimulus package and so we did a

2745
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:46,930
public-facing campaign aimed at

2746
02:00:45,069 --> 02:00:49,299
consumers to write the representatives

2747
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:51,550
to basically say I don't like the idea

2748
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:54,400
that I have to handle cash when I go and

2749
02:00:51,550 --> 02:00:56,050
purchase my cannabis and you know so I

2750
02:00:54,399 --> 02:00:58,479
think that we're gonna see how this goes

2751
02:00:56,050 --> 02:01:02,199
we've had the campaign up for two days

2752
02:00:58,479 --> 02:01:04,809
we've had 180 letters generated to

2753
02:01:02,199 --> 02:01:06,189
representatives in California we're

2754
02:01:04,810 --> 02:01:07,870
gonna keep going with this

2755
02:01:06,189 --> 02:01:10,899
and I think that this is an opportunity

2756
02:01:07,869 --> 02:01:13,479
for businesses also to help engage their

2757
02:01:10,899 --> 02:01:15,408
consumers and to recognize that you know

2758
02:01:13,479 --> 02:01:16,848
consumers do care about

2759
02:01:15,408 --> 02:01:18,529
it's happening and it's not just about

2760
02:01:16,849 --> 02:01:20,360
how expensive it is and it's not just

2761
02:01:18,529 --> 02:01:23,149
about products it's how we feel we're

2762
02:01:20,359 --> 02:01:26,058
being treated as adults that are seeking

2763
02:01:23,149 --> 02:01:29,089
out a service that is legal to us to

2764
02:01:26,059 --> 02:01:31,189
seek out and and so I think that in the

2765
02:01:29,090 --> 02:01:33,708
future there is definitely a role for

2766
02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:36,439
consumers to play you know I I really

2767
02:01:33,708 --> 02:01:39,828
would hope or wish that normal would

2768
02:01:36,439 --> 02:01:41,389
take a more nra approach and be more

2769
02:01:39,828 --> 02:01:44,058
aggressive I don't think they were

2770
02:01:41,389 --> 02:01:45,650
aggressive enough and I think that

2771
02:01:44,059 --> 02:01:47,418
that's really what we need you know we

2772
02:01:45,649 --> 02:01:49,279
need folks that are gonna be super

2773
02:01:47,418 --> 02:01:51,918
aggressive at the federal level on

2774
02:01:49,279 --> 02:01:54,198
behalf of consumers because there's

2775
02:01:51,918 --> 02:01:56,029
millions of cannabis consumers I would

2776
02:01:54,198 --> 02:01:57,529
you know hazard a guess that there's

2777
02:01:56,029 --> 02:02:00,349
more cannabis consumers and there are

2778
02:01:57,529 --> 02:02:02,719
gun users so you know we definitely have

2779
02:02:00,349 --> 02:02:06,319
a leverage they're often they enjoy or

2780
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:09,349
they overlap too often my belief is that

2781
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:13,880
cannabis consumers are potentially the

2782
02:02:09,349 --> 02:02:16,819
most powerful constituency in this

2783
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:19,699
industry they just somehow need to be

2784
02:02:16,819 --> 02:02:21,768
mobilized the lesson I'm taking away is

2785
02:02:19,698 --> 02:02:23,688
that this is almost a call to action I

2786
02:02:21,769 --> 02:02:25,909
may devote the rest of my life to

2787
02:02:23,689 --> 02:02:28,729
building that organization since it

2788
02:02:25,908 --> 02:02:30,558
really is near and dear to me and has

2789
02:02:28,729 --> 02:02:38,619
been for a long time because as a

2790
02:02:30,559 --> 02:02:38,619
consumer I feel invisible and unhurt I

2791
02:02:39,519 --> 02:02:47,659
just want to say and you know this you

2792
02:02:45,529 --> 02:02:51,050
know that when when it push comes to

2793
02:02:47,658 --> 02:02:53,089
shove right and things happen the

2794
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:55,538
dispensary operators they start sending

2795
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:58,429
emails and texts to their to their

2796
02:02:55,538 --> 02:02:59,748
consumers and we rounded them up and

2797
02:02:58,429 --> 02:03:02,239
next thing you know we have hundreds of

2798
02:02:59,748 --> 02:03:05,208
people at City Hall so it's not like it

2799
02:03:02,238 --> 02:03:06,918
can't be done we could do it but the

2800
02:03:05,208 --> 02:03:09,679
thing the part that I always have a

2801
02:03:06,918 --> 02:03:12,769
problem is it's not that we can do it we

2802
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:13,429
never keep it going once we get what we

2803
02:03:12,769 --> 02:03:16,429
want

2804
02:03:13,429 --> 02:03:18,889
everybody goes off to the wind and and

2805
02:03:16,429 --> 02:03:21,618
that's the most important thing is once

2806
02:03:18,889 --> 02:03:23,359
we do the call to action and everybody

2807
02:03:21,618 --> 02:03:25,819
we gotta keep it going

2808
02:03:23,359 --> 02:03:27,498
we can't just oh we got what we want

2809
02:03:25,819 --> 02:03:29,268
okay I'll see you guys next time there

2810
02:03:27,498 --> 02:03:31,578
is a problem

2811
02:03:29,269 --> 02:03:34,338
that doesn't work well I'm sure there's

2812
02:03:31,578 --> 02:03:35,868
strategies for mobilizing people and

2813
02:03:34,338 --> 02:03:38,719
maintaining their interest over time

2814
02:03:35,868 --> 02:03:41,298
that people have developed in the people

2815
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:43,429
who are you know you have done that

2816
02:03:41,298 --> 02:03:45,889
there's techniques to doing that I don't

2817
02:03:43,429 --> 02:03:48,588
think it's easy but it's doable and

2818
02:03:45,889 --> 02:03:50,989
there's people who are really good at

2819
02:03:48,588 --> 02:03:53,479
having clear strategies short term

2820
02:03:50,988 --> 02:03:55,578
medium term and long term keeping that

2821
02:03:53,479 --> 02:03:58,099
information in front of people and

2822
02:03:55,578 --> 02:04:00,349
trying to keep them mobilized I think

2823
02:03:58,099 --> 02:04:03,319
it's super hard but it's it's necessary

2824
02:04:00,349 --> 02:04:06,319
otherwise you're a you're a victim you

2825
02:04:03,319 --> 02:04:08,239
know you're just at the mercy and who

2826
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:10,339
wants to be at the mercy of anybody

2827
02:04:08,238 --> 02:04:12,138
including the state which from my

2828
02:04:10,338 --> 02:04:15,109
perspective is kind of acting like a

2829
02:04:12,139 --> 02:04:19,309
drug dealer in not the best sense of the

2830
02:04:15,109 --> 02:04:23,149
term yeah one of the things we were

2831
02:04:19,309 --> 02:04:26,838
trying to do with 420 being all month

2832
02:04:23,149 --> 02:04:28,699
and April was we were designing some

2833
02:04:26,838 --> 02:04:30,948
postcards we wanted to put at the point

2834
02:04:28,698 --> 02:04:33,048
of sale for every retailer we worked

2835
02:04:30,948 --> 02:04:35,448
with that they could melt a Sacramento

2836
02:04:33,048 --> 02:04:37,010
that you know itemize some of these

2837
02:04:35,448 --> 02:04:39,168
things because you're right the

2838
02:04:37,010 --> 02:04:41,809
consumers have to start making their

2839
02:04:39,168 --> 02:04:43,368
voices heard the industries talked to or

2840
02:04:41,809 --> 02:04:46,819
blue in the face and we're just not

2841
02:04:43,368 --> 02:04:48,498
doing interaction you know obviously the

2842
02:04:46,819 --> 02:04:50,839
Kovach kind of threw a wrench and not

2843
02:04:48,498 --> 02:04:52,728
when we tell our consumers weren't able

2844
02:04:50,838 --> 02:04:54,918
to walk into shops and everybody's got

2845
02:04:52,729 --> 02:04:59,029
masks on so we're working on a different

2846
02:04:54,918 --> 02:05:01,429
plan but you know what happens if a

2847
02:04:59,029 --> 02:05:03,819
couple million green postcards show up

2848
02:05:01,429 --> 02:05:06,859
in Sacramento saying taxes are too high

2849
02:05:03,819 --> 02:05:08,839
you know I don't have access to medicine

2850
02:05:06,859 --> 02:05:11,329
I have to drive three hours to get

2851
02:05:08,838 --> 02:05:14,979
epilepsy medicine for my child like

2852
02:05:11,328 --> 02:05:14,978
that's how we get things to change

2853
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:21,170
absolutely that's a big issue for us is

2854
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:23,270
how patient you know what happens to

2855
02:05:21,170 --> 02:05:26,149
comments almost like we need to organize

2856
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:28,520
a call patience and access to medicine

2857
02:05:26,149 --> 02:05:29,929
and and and and we're actually doing

2858
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:32,630
that we're organizing it in the

2859
02:05:29,930 --> 02:05:35,960
background we are doing that so just

2860
02:05:32,630 --> 02:05:39,800
quickly let's get to the speed round on

2861
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:42,350
some fun topics in no particular order

2862
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:43,850
but we got high times getting into

2863
02:05:42,350 --> 02:05:48,530
retail

2864
02:05:43,850 --> 02:05:52,400
we got weed maps subpoenas not gun round

2865
02:05:48,529 --> 02:05:57,949
and one of my favorites take them one at

2866
02:05:52,399 --> 02:06:01,369
a time topics med men which most people

2867
02:05:57,949 --> 02:06:05,000
here know for a long time I've been

2868
02:06:01,369 --> 02:06:08,779
calling the Enron of cannabis Adam

2869
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:11,810
Biermann the Martin shkreli the pharma

2870
02:06:08,779 --> 02:06:15,279
bro he's the canna bro so why don't we

2871
02:06:11,810 --> 02:06:17,990
start with High Times thinks that the

2872
02:06:15,279 --> 02:06:20,689
the retail game is where it's at and

2873
02:06:17,989 --> 02:06:23,779
they're making big pivot so who wants to

2874
02:06:20,689 --> 02:06:28,369
start with that one yeah I could start I

2875
02:06:23,779 --> 02:06:34,309
told Tom I was like everybody wants to

2876
02:06:28,369 --> 02:06:37,279
do retail until they get into retail it

2877
02:06:34,310 --> 02:06:41,090
sounds fun it looks you know glamorous

2878
02:06:37,279 --> 02:06:42,739
but it's you know I think High Times is

2879
02:06:41,090 --> 02:06:44,960
in for a rude awakening when they

2880
02:06:42,739 --> 02:06:47,750
realize that the amount of money they're

2881
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:49,279
there is it retail is horrible if you

2882
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:52,069
know unless you're gonna try to cut

2883
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:54,050
corners and try to have a certain things

2884
02:06:52,069 --> 02:06:55,939
here and there which I'm not gonna lie a

2885
02:06:54,050 --> 02:06:57,949
third of retailers are doing that you

2886
02:06:55,939 --> 02:06:59,750
know they're not doing things that

2887
02:06:57,949 --> 02:07:03,619
exactly the way that they have been

2888
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:06,109
supposed to so you know it and which

2889
02:07:03,619 --> 02:07:08,390
shocked me because there's been a few

2890
02:07:06,109 --> 02:07:12,559
quite a few retailers that have already

2891
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:14,840
been busted by the BCC legal ones doing

2892
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:17,030
things that they're not supposed to I

2893
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:19,220
mean I know of one that got caught with

2894
02:07:17,029 --> 02:07:21,500
a hundred pounds of illicit cannabis

2895
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:23,449
selling it out of the jar from

2896
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:25,850
underneath the register underneath the

2897
02:07:23,449 --> 02:07:28,769
counter and they have their license and

2898
02:07:25,850 --> 02:07:30,600
nothing's nothing's done so

2899
02:07:28,770 --> 02:07:33,540
you know that's another disheartening

2900
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:34,980
fact you know off subject but yeah I

2901
02:07:33,539 --> 02:07:36,659
think High Times is in for a rude

2902
02:07:34,979 --> 02:07:38,849
awakening when they realize that the

2903
02:07:36,659 --> 02:07:40,260
retail business is not all that was

2904
02:07:38,850 --> 02:07:42,300
meant to be and that they're not going

2905
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:45,780
to be able to get the evaluation that

2906
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:48,720
they want from retail to sell it or what

2907
02:07:45,779 --> 02:07:50,699
they eventually plan on doing well wait

2908
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:52,800
a second let's back up a second where

2909
02:07:50,699 --> 02:07:54,960
they just slap where they just let go or

2910
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:56,279
there was a slap on the wrist because

2911
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:59,039
that's dumb

2912
02:07:56,279 --> 02:08:01,289
that's not enforcement no it's not

2913
02:07:59,039 --> 02:08:03,359
enforcement at all and you know the BCC

2914
02:08:01,289 --> 02:08:05,850
has always said oh we only enforced and

2915
02:08:03,359 --> 02:08:07,769
the DCR we only owned of course against

2916
02:08:05,850 --> 02:08:09,660
legal operators because that's that's

2917
02:08:07,770 --> 02:08:10,950
that's what we can do that's what we're

2918
02:08:09,659 --> 02:08:12,960
allowed to do we're not allowed to

2919
02:08:10,949 --> 02:08:15,000
enforce against illegal but they're not

2920
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:18,480
enforcing against legal ones either that

2921
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:23,810
are breaking the laws so and when you do

2922
02:08:18,479 --> 02:08:23,809
that now you're creating a completely

2923
02:08:24,289 --> 02:08:29,010
miscued market because now you have

2924
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:31,710
legal operators that are doing illegal

2925
02:08:29,010 --> 02:08:33,770
stuff to cut corners isn't Creek isn't

2926
02:08:31,710 --> 02:08:36,239
cushy punch back to business as usual

2927
02:08:33,770 --> 02:08:38,280
because she punches back the business

2928
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:40,949
hey you know I mean they got caught with

2929
02:08:38,279 --> 02:08:44,069
a completely illegal facility running to

2930
02:08:40,949 --> 02:08:47,340
location and again I know are you guys

2931
02:08:44,069 --> 02:08:49,469
selling cookie punch in your shop I am

2932
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:52,260
NOT but I am friends with the owner and

2933
02:08:49,470 --> 02:08:54,300
I met him up with him the other day and

2934
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:56,699
I asked him he said oh yeah we're gonna

2935
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:59,100
be back online so I don't think they

2936
02:08:56,699 --> 02:09:01,889
actually have products back out there

2937
02:08:59,100 --> 02:09:03,930
yet but you know it all it is is the

2938
02:09:01,890 --> 02:09:06,210
brand gets caught they find another

2939
02:09:03,930 --> 02:09:08,640
licensee they make a licensing agreement

2940
02:09:06,210 --> 02:09:11,130
for the name and next thing you know

2941
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:15,240
that brand is back online with a new

2942
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:19,079
license so you know and again I I love

2943
02:09:15,239 --> 02:09:20,849
the guy very nice guy family guy but you

2944
02:09:19,079 --> 02:09:23,909
know when when people are doing things

2945
02:09:20,850 --> 02:09:25,770
like this and he's not the worst you

2946
02:09:23,909 --> 02:09:27,539
know the other retailers selling you

2947
02:09:25,770 --> 02:09:30,750
know literally they confiscated a

2948
02:09:27,539 --> 02:09:33,840
hundred pounds from his facility and I

2949
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:36,449
know of another incident where the idiot

2950
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:39,029
manager started running down the back

2951
02:09:36,449 --> 02:09:42,800
alley with like 20 pounds and the bcc

2952
02:09:39,029 --> 02:09:45,139
agents tackled him okay I

2953
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:47,720
and they're still operating it makes no

2954
02:09:45,140 --> 02:09:50,450
sense and I'm over here worried about

2955
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:51,890
taxes and this and that I'm getting you

2956
02:09:50,449 --> 02:09:53,689
know if I'm late I'll get a threat

2957
02:09:51,890 --> 02:09:56,840
letter that I'm gonna lose my license

2958
02:09:53,689 --> 02:09:58,759
but then the person who completely does

2959
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:04,279
something illegal and gets caught

2960
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:06,140
red-handed nothing so it just it's a lot

2961
02:10:04,279 --> 02:10:09,199
of things just don't make sense to me

2962
02:10:06,140 --> 02:10:12,079
you know and and if you're not going to

2963
02:10:09,199 --> 02:10:14,630
enforce in areas where you have complete

2964
02:10:12,079 --> 02:10:17,479
control to enforce let alone the ones

2965
02:10:14,630 --> 02:10:19,430
that you don't well again you know

2966
02:10:17,479 --> 02:10:21,469
you're setting us up for failure and

2967
02:10:19,430 --> 02:10:23,390
you're rewarding the people that are

2968
02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:26,750
doing illegal stuff to continue doing

2969
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:28,789
illegal stuff yeah okay so back to the

2970
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:32,000
question at hand about high times I

2971
02:10:28,789 --> 02:10:35,119
don't know if anyone else is as bored as

2972
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:39,109
I am but I actually pulled up the SEC

2973
02:10:35,119 --> 02:10:43,849
filing on to look at what assets were

2974
02:10:39,109 --> 02:10:47,329
included in that purchase so you've got

2975
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:49,370
to kind of unwind it free harvest before

2976
02:10:47,329 --> 02:10:53,390
harvest entered the California picture

2977
02:10:49,369 --> 02:10:56,630
it was have a heart out of Seattle that

2978
02:10:53,390 --> 02:11:01,670
was you know getting some of the retail

2979
02:10:56,630 --> 02:11:05,810
permits in not so coveted jurisdictions

2980
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:08,029
let's say so harvest purchased have a

2981
02:11:05,810 --> 02:11:11,480
hearts dispensaries and then they were

2982
02:11:08,029 --> 02:11:15,019
also in the process of getting some of

2983
02:11:11,479 --> 02:11:17,959
their own licenses so I unpacked just

2984
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:19,790
what it is that High Times allegedly

2985
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:22,970
purchased and I'm saying allegedly

2986
02:11:19,789 --> 02:11:27,140
because you still need a stock to go

2987
02:11:22,970 --> 02:11:29,810
public and on all of these different

2988
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:31,660
jurisdictions to sign off on this before

2989
02:11:29,810 --> 02:11:33,980
this deal could ever go through so

2990
02:11:31,659 --> 02:11:37,369
minimum I would say you're looking at a

2991
02:11:33,979 --> 02:11:40,819
year before you know any dots would be

2992
02:11:37,369 --> 02:11:42,380
the t's would be crossed and and eyes

2993
02:11:40,819 --> 02:11:47,449
would be dotted before this would be

2994
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:49,789
completed so we've got a harvest in Palm

2995
02:11:47,449 --> 02:11:52,220
Springs and if you're familiar with Palm

2996
02:11:49,789 --> 02:11:54,019
Springs Market Palm Springs is one of

2997
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:56,720
two jurisdictions in the entire state

2998
02:11:54,020 --> 02:12:00,650
that have an open process

2999
02:11:56,720 --> 02:12:03,050
for retail the other being lompoc so if

3000
02:12:00,649 --> 02:12:04,670
if you're interested in getting a retail

3001
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:06,230
permit those are the two jurisdictions

3002
02:12:04,670 --> 02:12:09,470
that if you can find property that

3003
02:12:06,229 --> 02:12:11,689
qualify you can get you pretty much can

3004
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:14,510
get a retail permit there so you've got

3005
02:12:11,689 --> 02:12:16,429
a very overcrowded market in Palm

3006
02:12:14,510 --> 02:12:19,460
Springs that's one of them you got

3007
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:22,220
another one in harvest of venice which

3008
02:12:19,460 --> 02:12:24,319
if my memory serves me correctly I

3009
02:12:22,220 --> 02:12:27,650
believe Venice is only a medical market

3010
02:12:24,319 --> 02:12:31,599
which is a really tough way to compete

3011
02:12:27,649 --> 02:12:35,089
these days we've got harvest of Merced

3012
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:36,620
you've got harvest of Riverside and I

3013
02:12:35,090 --> 02:12:38,390
don't think that one is opened yet

3014
02:12:36,619 --> 02:12:40,039
you've got harvest of Han and ferd which

3015
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:42,760
isn't open yet you've got harvest of

3016
02:12:40,039 --> 02:12:47,890
blithe which is definitely not open yet

3017
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:51,380
and then you've got to very expensive

3018
02:12:47,890 --> 02:12:54,260
dispensary permits in San Francisco

3019
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:58,430
you've got another one in San Bernardino

3020
02:12:54,260 --> 02:13:03,920
which I don't believe is open and two in

3021
02:12:58,430 --> 02:13:06,170
Oakland one in Kalinga and the final one

3022
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:10,699
being in Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz only

3023
02:13:06,170 --> 02:13:12,170
allows you to sell off 20% of the

3024
02:13:10,699 --> 02:13:16,699
business so what they sold was their

3025
02:13:12,170 --> 02:13:20,980
twenty percent stake in or no actually

3026
02:13:16,699 --> 02:13:27,470
it's only ten percent so you've got a

3027
02:13:20,979 --> 02:13:29,359
lot of less you know desirable areas to

3028
02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:34,159
operate you know I know that the Kalinga

3029
02:13:29,359 --> 02:13:38,239
store is if it's still open is doing

3030
02:13:34,159 --> 02:13:40,099
about $1,000 a day so um the these are

3031
02:13:38,239 --> 02:13:43,719
the types of assets I want everyone to

3032
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:47,270
be aware of that harvest unload

3033
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:49,280
potentially unloaded on to high times

3034
02:13:47,270 --> 02:13:51,620
high time still has to go public and

3035
02:13:49,279 --> 02:13:56,210
still has to you know take possession of

3036
02:13:51,619 --> 02:13:59,239
these and in the midst of a pandemic

3037
02:13:56,210 --> 02:14:03,710
when everybody is shifting from retail

3038
02:13:59,239 --> 02:14:06,260
to kurd side or delivery you know those

3039
02:14:03,710 --> 02:14:07,850
business models absolutely do not make

3040
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:09,730
sense in either Oakland or San Francisco

3041
02:14:07,850 --> 02:14:12,039
and

3042
02:14:09,729 --> 02:14:15,509
maybe they could make sense if you're

3043
02:14:12,039 --> 02:14:17,949
going to turn all of those assets into

3044
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:20,440
trying to become a statewide delivery

3045
02:14:17,949 --> 02:14:24,010
brand is the only thing that I could

3046
02:14:20,439 --> 02:14:26,738
think that they would attempt to do but

3047
02:14:24,010 --> 02:14:29,350
that would all depend on how expensive

3048
02:14:26,738 --> 02:14:31,988
those San Francisco and Oakland

3049
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:33,700
properties really are and how much those

3050
02:14:31,988 --> 02:14:36,699
are bleeding them dry until they

3051
02:14:33,699 --> 02:14:38,979
actually are up and running and up and

3052
02:14:36,699 --> 02:14:40,779
running in a post pandemic world where

3053
02:14:38,979 --> 02:14:43,959
we're not wearing masks and were you

3054
02:14:40,779 --> 02:14:47,679
know congregating again and so this to

3055
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:49,569
me should be viewed as a Hail Mary by

3056
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:54,579
both harvest who's looking to unload

3057
02:14:49,569 --> 02:14:56,829
their less desirable assets and a Hail

3058
02:14:54,579 --> 02:14:58,630
Mary by high times hoping that this will

3059
02:14:56,829 --> 02:15:01,238
help them go public and that's all this

3060
02:14:58,630 --> 02:15:04,539
is and nothing more and just quickly a

3061
02:15:01,238 --> 02:15:08,369
show of hands the panelists who here is

3062
02:15:04,539 --> 02:15:13,859
getting in on the high times reggae

3063
02:15:08,369 --> 02:15:13,859
offering getting in while the goings hot

3064
02:15:15,029 --> 02:15:19,029
but you know something funny about high

3065
02:15:17,289 --> 02:15:20,769
times in that whole situation first of

3066
02:15:19,029 --> 02:15:23,469
all it's just hoping screams Hard Rock

3067
02:15:20,770 --> 02:15:28,000
Cafe to me and like this idea of just

3068
02:15:23,470 --> 02:15:30,789
these super like commercial just wonky

3069
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:34,869
look in places that have like cheech's

3070
02:15:30,789 --> 02:15:38,199
pipe in a glass display or something but

3071
02:15:34,869 --> 02:15:39,399
funny High Times story so you know flow

3072
02:15:38,199 --> 02:15:41,590
kana we launched this dirty money

3073
02:15:39,399 --> 02:15:43,359
campaign on a Monday and we did an

3074
02:15:41,590 --> 02:15:44,890
Instagram post it was basically like

3075
02:15:43,359 --> 02:15:46,539
encouraging people to contact the

3076
02:15:44,890 --> 02:15:48,160
representative and you know we don't

3077
02:15:46,539 --> 02:15:49,810
want to have to handle cash great

3078
02:15:48,159 --> 02:15:52,149
actually posted it some dude from High

3079
02:15:49,810 --> 02:15:53,950
Times who works there commented and was

3080
02:15:52,149 --> 02:15:56,649
like all his comment says was your

3081
02:15:53,949 --> 02:15:58,829
lobbying wrong or that's not how you do

3082
02:15:56,649 --> 02:16:01,659
it or something like that and I was like

3083
02:15:58,829 --> 02:16:02,829
okay so we responded and we were like

3084
02:16:01,659 --> 02:16:04,449
you know what do you mean we think this

3085
02:16:02,829 --> 02:16:05,738
is an issue people would care about so

3086
02:16:04,449 --> 02:16:07,389
she says you just purchased 13

3087
02:16:05,738 --> 02:16:09,250
dispensaries and this is about not

3088
02:16:07,390 --> 02:16:11,260
having to handle cash in a dispensary

3089
02:16:09,250 --> 02:16:14,079
and they responded that of course they

3090
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:16,750
care and that they invented grassroots

3091
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:19,809
lobbying so in case folks didn't know

3092
02:16:16,750 --> 02:16:21,819
that out there hi time invented

3093
02:16:19,810 --> 02:16:22,780
grassroots lobbying which actually isn't

3094
02:16:21,819 --> 02:16:25,389
even a thing

3095
02:16:22,779 --> 02:16:27,880
but they

3096
02:16:25,389 --> 02:16:29,708
and so you know they obviously really

3097
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:32,019
know what they're doing and they've got

3098
02:16:29,708 --> 02:16:38,228
a great team I did just read that stormy

3099
02:16:32,019 --> 02:16:43,510
Simon is no longer the CEO step down she

3100
02:16:38,228 --> 02:16:46,000
lasted four months yeah yeah now I I had

3101
02:16:43,510 --> 02:16:48,849
conversations with stormy where I told

3102
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:51,099
her to get out I said you do because you

3103
02:16:48,849 --> 02:16:53,799
know where it started was when I got the

3104
02:16:51,099 --> 02:16:55,659
emails and you know the one from today

3105
02:16:53,799 --> 02:16:58,539
is coming you know who sent it high

3106
02:16:55,659 --> 02:17:01,029
times investor who sent it Adam Levin

3107
02:16:58,540 --> 02:17:02,830
and then there was one that had Stormy's

3108
02:17:01,029 --> 02:17:04,988
name on it and I immediately emailed her

3109
02:17:02,829 --> 02:17:08,949
and said don't let them put your name I

3110
02:17:04,988 --> 02:17:11,289
was like and then I was like don't you

3111
02:17:08,949 --> 02:17:14,849
do not a couple years from now want to

3112
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:18,880
be associated with duping little old

3113
02:17:14,849 --> 02:17:20,679
ladies who invested in high times you do

3114
02:17:18,879 --> 02:17:22,448
not want your name associated with that

3115
02:17:20,679 --> 02:17:23,738
and then we had a long phone call and

3116
02:17:22,449 --> 02:17:25,420
I've you know I've been trading emails

3117
02:17:23,738 --> 02:17:30,250
I'm gonna try to get her on to do a

3118
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:32,349
webcast but just and being clear for

3119
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:35,709
anybody who's watching coz I'm gonna cut

3120
02:17:32,349 --> 02:17:38,469
the high time segment so people don't

3121
02:17:35,709 --> 02:17:41,799
have to wait till the end the people who

3122
02:17:38,468 --> 02:17:44,888
currently run high times are a bunch of

3123
02:17:41,799 --> 02:17:47,379
finance douchebags who have nothing to

3124
02:17:44,888 --> 02:17:50,138
do with the grass roots history of high

3125
02:17:47,379 --> 02:17:56,438
times from the sick from the 70s and 80s

3126
02:17:50,138 --> 02:17:59,098
and any master you know any good grower

3127
02:17:56,439 --> 02:18:03,699
does not read high times today

3128
02:17:59,099 --> 02:18:06,040
okay so just everybody who is thinking

3129
02:18:03,699 --> 02:18:08,019
of investing in high times or who thinks

3130
02:18:06,040 --> 02:18:11,979
oh my god that'd be amazing to go to a

3131
02:18:08,019 --> 02:18:14,738
high times dispensary so we have a

3132
02:18:11,978 --> 02:18:17,379
couple brands on here Amanda is Flo kana

3133
02:18:14,738 --> 02:18:20,590
going to rush to supply product to High

3134
02:18:17,379 --> 02:18:22,238
Times retail Shannon is Fiddler's

3135
02:18:20,590 --> 02:18:23,859
Green's is that going to be the first

3136
02:18:22,238 --> 02:18:26,709
phone call you make when they take over

3137
02:18:23,859 --> 02:18:29,229
those retail operations and shame on you

3138
02:18:26,709 --> 02:18:33,428
we'll see I blame high times in a lot of

3139
02:18:29,228 --> 02:18:35,349
ways for bringing this weird idea of

3140
02:18:33,429 --> 02:18:37,489
what quality is to the marketplace and

3141
02:18:35,349 --> 02:18:39,620
that's really been hard for sun-grown

3142
02:18:37,489 --> 02:18:42,170
because when I was growing up in Chicago

3143
02:18:39,620 --> 02:18:44,690
and looking at High Times Magazine they

3144
02:18:42,170 --> 02:18:46,280
had be centerfolds of buds that are

3145
02:18:44,690 --> 02:18:49,610
supposed to be like the highest-quality

3146
02:18:46,280 --> 02:18:51,320
buds like these were the buds and they

3147
02:18:49,610 --> 02:18:53,750
were all indoor and they were all grown

3148
02:18:51,319 --> 02:18:55,520
like this far from the light and none of

3149
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:56,959
them really looked I was would come

3150
02:18:55,520 --> 02:18:57,950
compare it to like the Playboy

3151
02:18:56,959 --> 02:18:59,479
centerfold

3152
02:18:57,950 --> 02:19:01,250
we're like you grow up thinking that

3153
02:18:59,479 --> 02:19:02,569
that's what like the ideal woman looks

3154
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:05,059
like and then you get out in the world

3155
02:19:02,569 --> 02:19:06,680
and you realize that was all bullshit I

3156
02:19:05,059 --> 02:19:08,779
kind of feel like that's what high times

3157
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:10,819
did they set it up for people consumers

3158
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:14,900
to think that quality meant orange hairs

3159
02:19:10,819 --> 02:19:17,750
and tight nugs and that's not true so

3160
02:19:14,899 --> 02:19:20,659
then I make corn hub of cannabis no no I

3161
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:22,489
kept Kevin I have a video clip of that

3162
02:19:20,659 --> 02:19:24,799
I'll play in the end the on-demand

3163
02:19:22,489 --> 02:19:28,819
version Kevin Jerry said it best which

3164
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:32,269
was the article on the left side of the

3165
02:19:28,819 --> 02:19:34,819
page which is that hydro bud its sole

3166
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:39,590
purpose was to sell the product on the

3167
02:19:34,819 --> 02:19:43,819
right side of the page which was an HP s

3168
02:19:39,590 --> 02:19:45,469
light or whatever it was what you have

3169
02:19:43,819 --> 02:19:47,119
is you have information that's used as

3170
02:19:45,469 --> 02:19:50,209
basically marketing it's kind of like

3171
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:51,440
reading old high times because I've read

3172
02:19:50,209 --> 02:19:54,289
the shit in years it's like reading high

3173
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:57,110
times and every article was basically to

3174
02:19:54,290 --> 02:19:58,521
sell the material on the next page so

3175
02:19:57,110 --> 02:20:00,440
they're not giving you any information

3176
02:19:58,521 --> 02:20:03,620
they're giving you a marketing pitch

3177
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:06,351
wrapped around some photos yeah

3178
02:20:03,620 --> 02:20:08,540
absolutely and and but unfortunately the

3179
02:20:06,351 --> 02:20:10,610
impact that it had on the consumer

3180
02:20:08,540 --> 02:20:13,670
marketplace was that all these years

3181
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:15,681
later in doors being sold for $65 an

3182
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:18,290
eighth and Sun grown is lucky to get 40

3183
02:20:15,681 --> 02:20:19,760
and I do think that's high times played

3184
02:20:18,290 --> 02:20:21,500
a huge role in that like I don't think

3185
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:23,239
they'll ever take responsibility for it

3186
02:20:21,500 --> 02:20:26,299
but I think they played a huge role in

3187
02:20:23,239 --> 02:20:28,640
really leading the consumer or on us

3188
02:20:26,299 --> 02:20:33,259
astray when it comes to knowing what a

3189
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:35,840
quality cannabis product is yeah it's a

3190
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:39,800
double-edged sword right because for I

3191
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:42,799
grew up in Texas and a lot of my first

3192
02:20:39,799 --> 02:20:44,989
exposure to cannabis was you know High

3193
02:20:42,799 --> 02:20:47,299
Times magazines that we were able to

3194
02:20:44,989 --> 02:20:48,659
look out and see so it brought it to

3195
02:20:47,299 --> 02:20:50,340
people who weren't

3196
02:20:48,659 --> 02:20:53,159
Northern California weren't part of the

3197
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:56,489
community but like Amanda said it was

3198
02:20:53,159 --> 02:20:58,860
also miss branding and misrepresenting

3199
02:20:56,489 --> 02:21:01,590
it was you know selling McDonald's

3200
02:20:58,860 --> 02:21:04,380
hamburgers like it was filet mignon and

3201
02:21:01,590 --> 02:21:12,478
so we've got to undo that at this point

3202
02:21:04,379 --> 02:21:14,129
I like that innovation be rushing to do

3203
02:21:12,478 --> 02:21:16,679
business with high tines

3204
02:21:14,129 --> 02:21:22,139
retail shops that's not really in line

3205
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:25,729
with our brands and our mission got it

3206
02:21:22,139 --> 02:21:31,219
okay have we beaten high times

3207
02:21:25,728 --> 02:21:34,829
sufficient will okay

3208
02:21:31,219 --> 02:21:37,199
do we want to do weed maps for me I'm

3209
02:21:34,829 --> 02:21:38,728
cognizant that it's 10 20 so why don't

3210
02:21:37,200 --> 02:21:43,920
we do a quick wrap and you won't have

3211
02:21:38,728 --> 02:21:45,599
any thoughts on weed maps and said Gemma

3212
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:46,110
come say hi to everyone quick quick

3213
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:49,380
quick quick

3214
02:21:46,110 --> 02:21:51,750
oh my gosh look at you I left her and

3215
02:21:49,379 --> 02:21:54,239
we're getting a tour of Greg's place too

3216
02:21:51,750 --> 02:22:20,398
III left her unsupervised with a bag of

3217
02:21:54,239 --> 02:22:25,829
tortilla chips nothing like getting a

3218
02:22:20,398 --> 02:22:30,959
delivery from a CEO I see you're

3219
02:22:25,829 --> 02:22:32,840
actually going Greg on this subject

3220
02:22:30,959 --> 02:22:36,269
you'll ask you a really quick question

3221
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:38,700
in terms of staffing and everything have

3222
02:22:36,270 --> 02:22:41,010
you had to go down how has all of this

3223
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:46,620
impacted your what you know your

3224
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:49,978
staffing well I mean it's impacted

3225
02:22:46,620 --> 02:22:56,160
stuffing in multiple ways from staffers

3226
02:22:49,978 --> 02:22:58,049
that I lose staff yeah so I mean a

3227
02:22:56,159 --> 02:23:01,250
staffing I've lost a lot of staff you

3228
02:22:58,049 --> 02:23:02,989
know Garrett on let's quickly go to

3229
02:23:01,250 --> 02:23:04,489
let's talk

3230
02:23:02,989 --> 02:23:06,069
we'd maps and then we'll come back to

3231
02:23:04,489 --> 02:23:13,090
Greg

3232
02:23:06,069 --> 02:23:14,709
okay so go for it so anyone want to talk

3233
02:23:13,090 --> 02:23:15,840
anybody been following the weed map

3234
02:23:14,709 --> 02:23:21,279
stuff

3235
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:26,021
yeah the subpoena I mean who doesn't

3236
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:30,640
love to read a good subpoena is the best

3237
02:23:26,021 --> 02:23:34,840
one ever you know obviously there's

3238
02:23:30,639 --> 02:23:36,819
going to be more news to come and it's

3239
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:47,979
just very ironic that it's the Chinese

3240
02:23:36,819 --> 02:23:49,750
you're the rat people I mean like Ardley

3241
02:23:47,979 --> 02:23:53,799
all the articles that have been written

3242
02:23:49,750 --> 02:23:55,510
about it suggests you know the federal

3243
02:23:53,799 --> 02:23:58,599
government's sure did cast a very wide

3244
02:23:55,510 --> 02:24:03,600
net and it's not clear who they're after

3245
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:03,600
but more definitely will be revealed

3246
02:24:06,030 --> 02:24:11,500
anyone else have any I mean they think

3247
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:14,050
they're going after the legal market now

3248
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:17,920
they're going to take down law-abiding

3249
02:24:14,049 --> 02:24:22,959
shops during a pandemic that are one of

3250
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:25,110
the few businesses paying tax oh thank

3251
02:24:22,959 --> 02:24:25,109
you

3252
02:24:25,979 --> 02:24:29,969
well my hope is that they're gonna be

3253
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:32,399
the little discerning and they're gonna

3254
02:24:29,969 --> 02:24:34,379
look deeper into the folks that are in

3255
02:24:32,399 --> 02:24:37,079
question and and there's definitely some

3256
02:24:34,379 --> 02:24:39,000
people that have sense or you know at

3257
02:24:37,079 --> 02:24:41,879
the time we're in process of getting

3258
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:42,931
their licensure and maybe have been you

3259
02:24:41,879 --> 02:24:45,890
know trying to move in that direction

3260
02:24:42,931 --> 02:24:48,390
and other folks that have been flaunting

3261
02:24:45,890 --> 02:24:51,181
you know the fact that they are on meat

3262
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:52,140
maps and not having licenses and so my

3263
02:24:51,181 --> 02:24:54,840
hope is that it's not a

3264
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:56,969
one-size-fits-all scenario and that they

3265
02:24:54,840 --> 02:25:03,450
prioritize who they think are the bigger

3266
02:24:56,969 --> 02:25:06,090
the more egregious actors I guess it's

3267
02:25:03,450 --> 02:25:11,340
hard to know what's really behind this

3268
02:25:06,090 --> 02:25:13,079
if it's a bill bars agenda or something

3269
02:25:11,340 --> 02:25:18,719
else going on I don't know if anyone has

3270
02:25:13,079 --> 02:25:20,969
any insights into into that so just

3271
02:25:18,719 --> 02:25:27,510
quickly Greg how many deliveries are you

3272
02:25:20,969 --> 02:25:32,069
about to go out with how many of them

3273
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:37,380
got it how many of you doing a dang well

3274
02:25:32,069 --> 02:25:39,719
like 30 something or so so so bad and

3275
02:25:37,379 --> 02:25:43,199
are you the main delivery driver do you

3276
02:25:39,719 --> 02:25:46,350
have this gets back to your staffing so

3277
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:49,050
I'm the main delivery driver that's

3278
02:25:46,351 --> 02:25:52,500
that's what's happened and yeah I've

3279
02:25:49,049 --> 02:25:57,539
lost like between people getting sick

3280
02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:59,489
people being afraid to work and just and

3281
02:25:57,540 --> 02:26:01,771
also what's happening is and this is

3282
02:25:59,489 --> 02:26:03,989
something that I'm sure a lot of people

3283
02:26:01,771 --> 02:26:06,590
are there's like a competition amongst

3284
02:26:03,989 --> 02:26:09,530
the businesses for good employees

3285
02:26:06,590 --> 02:26:12,181
because people are just dropping off and

3286
02:26:09,530 --> 02:26:17,120
to find a good employee

3287
02:26:12,181 --> 02:26:21,659
I had another company another retailer

3288
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:24,030
outbid me for my own employee literally

3289
02:26:21,659 --> 02:26:25,950
they stole my employee for me so I've

3290
02:26:24,030 --> 02:26:29,070
lost the employees like that as well and

3291
02:26:25,950 --> 02:26:31,351
I pay really good but I don't sugarcoat

3292
02:26:29,069 --> 02:26:32,959
it I don't lie to employees I don't tell

3293
02:26:31,351 --> 02:26:35,670
them something that's not gonna happen

3294
02:26:32,959 --> 02:26:37,439
you know I tell them book you you not a

3295
02:26:35,670 --> 02:26:38,940
manager you'd still need to get this

3296
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:39,450
training you don't even know how to do

3297
02:26:38,940 --> 02:26:42,329
math

3298
02:26:39,450 --> 02:26:43,681
how can you even yeah can you you don't

3299
02:26:42,329 --> 02:26:44,729
know QuickBooks you don't know metric

3300
02:26:43,681 --> 02:26:46,800
you don't know this you don't know that

3301
02:26:44,729 --> 02:26:49,500
and then there's other employers that

3302
02:26:46,799 --> 02:26:51,270
are just just feeding these employees

3303
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:53,610
with a lot of stuff in their head and

3304
02:26:51,271 --> 02:26:55,561
making promises that they are never

3305
02:26:53,610 --> 02:26:58,530
gonna fulfill just so they could get the

3306
02:26:55,560 --> 02:27:01,890
employee there as a budtender for the

3307
02:26:58,530 --> 02:27:04,590
meantime and some of those how do I know

3308
02:27:01,890 --> 02:27:06,840
I know the owners I'm friends with all

3309
02:27:04,590 --> 02:27:10,409
of them so I know their personalities I

3310
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:11,190
know their characters though we know

3311
02:27:10,409 --> 02:27:14,190
each other

3312
02:27:11,190 --> 02:27:18,030
and so it's really tough finding good

3313
02:27:14,190 --> 02:27:20,159
employees in this pandemic it has made

3314
02:27:18,030 --> 02:27:23,220
everything worse you know I mean we get

3315
02:27:20,159 --> 02:27:26,431
flooded like on indeed I'll get three

3316
02:27:23,219 --> 02:27:28,979
thousand emails of people applying for a

3317
02:27:26,431 --> 02:27:33,239
job and we specifically put must have

3318
02:27:28,979 --> 02:27:39,689
experienced and over 2,000 of them will

3319
02:27:33,239 --> 02:27:42,869
be will be bartenders or something like

3320
02:27:39,690 --> 02:27:44,190
that and you know we do want to hire and

3321
02:27:42,870 --> 02:27:46,740
we want to give them a chance because

3322
02:27:44,190 --> 02:27:50,310
people need jobs but then they come in

3323
02:27:46,739 --> 02:27:52,739
here and it's it's very hard because

3324
02:27:50,310 --> 02:27:55,770
even bartenders they have different

3325
02:27:52,739 --> 02:27:59,340
habits and different things that you

3326
02:27:55,771 --> 02:28:01,739
can't do in cannabis in cannabis as a

3327
02:27:59,340 --> 02:28:04,530
retail if you're selling a product and

3328
02:28:01,739 --> 02:28:06,989
it's because the state one the state

3329
02:28:04,530 --> 02:28:09,420
says check it in the front the city says

3330
02:28:06,989 --> 02:28:11,280
check it at the register you know and so

3331
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:13,649
you have to have an ID checker in the

3332
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:15,480
front and in the back and a lot of times

3333
02:28:13,649 --> 02:28:17,819
with bartenders if you don't look if you

3334
02:28:15,479 --> 02:28:21,709
look over 21 they don't even card you at

3335
02:28:17,819 --> 02:28:24,209
all so those are two big differences

3336
02:28:21,709 --> 02:28:26,939
because that could cost the business a

3337
02:28:24,209 --> 02:28:32,489
big violation if you don't scan the

3338
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:34,440
person's ID so you know it's just a good

3339
02:28:32,489 --> 02:28:37,049
employee has become a very big commodity

3340
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:41,300
at least out here in Los Angeles in

3341
02:28:37,049 --> 02:28:44,819
cannabis very very difficult to find and

3342
02:28:41,299 --> 02:28:46,109
a lot I'm not the only owner business

3343
02:28:44,819 --> 02:28:49,049
owner unless you're one of the bigger

3344
02:28:46,110 --> 02:28:51,720
companies who's funded and and got a

3345
02:28:49,049 --> 02:28:52,670
billion dollar evaluation a small

3346
02:28:51,719 --> 02:28:55,159
business

3347
02:28:52,670 --> 02:28:58,310
are having to either play delivery boy

3348
02:28:55,159 --> 02:29:00,681
but tender doing whatever you have to do

3349
02:28:58,310 --> 02:29:05,690
to make sure your small business

3350
02:29:00,681 --> 02:29:09,681
survives well what are we seeing in

3351
02:29:05,690 --> 02:29:11,870
terms of layoffs in the industry so a

3352
02:29:09,681 --> 02:29:15,261
lot of the layoffs are coming in

3353
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:17,601
Manufacturing is what I'm seeing not too

3354
02:29:15,261 --> 02:29:21,470
much in cultivation and not too much in

3355
02:29:17,601 --> 02:29:24,170
retail because retail were hurting for

3356
02:29:21,470 --> 02:29:27,399
employees but manufacturing I've even

3357
02:29:24,170 --> 02:29:29,899
seen a few companies already go bankrupt

3358
02:29:27,399 --> 02:29:32,029
example open and district edibles

3359
02:29:29,899 --> 02:29:34,879
they're gone they're never gonna be

3360
02:29:32,030 --> 02:29:38,450
around again you know that that those

3361
02:29:34,879 --> 02:29:41,930
two brands are gone they are gone gone

3362
02:29:38,450 --> 02:29:43,909
and they were great brands my customers

3363
02:29:41,931 --> 02:29:47,630
loved it because the price point was

3364
02:29:43,909 --> 02:29:50,931
good and and so you've already seen the

3365
02:29:47,629 --> 02:29:55,879
first of a few businesses because of

3366
02:29:50,931 --> 02:29:59,210
this coronavirus already suffer and you

3367
02:29:55,879 --> 02:30:01,100
know because the whole pandemic just it

3368
02:29:59,209 --> 02:30:05,119
just multiplied everything that we're

3369
02:30:01,101 --> 02:30:07,610
feeling already you know when you

3370
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:10,761
compile everything that's going on it

3371
02:30:07,610 --> 02:30:20,989
makes it very very difficult very very

3372
02:30:10,761 --> 02:30:22,909
difficult so why don't why don't we wrap

3373
02:30:20,989 --> 02:30:26,440
on that and we can we can always get

3374
02:30:22,909 --> 02:30:29,300
back to med men and future episodes but

3375
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:32,181
everyone did with with calling it a day

3376
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:34,579

3377
02:30:32,181 --> 02:30:37,399

3378
02:30:34,579 --> 02:30:40,370

02:30:56,810 --> 02:30:59,379

3383
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:09,520
