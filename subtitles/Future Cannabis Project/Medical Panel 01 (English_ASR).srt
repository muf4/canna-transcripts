1
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:22,940
so my name is wait laughter and

2
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:26,359
among other things an advocate for

3
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:29,300
medical cannabis and it's my pleasure to

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:32,390
serve as the person who's going to

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:37,308
moderate a discussion between forests

6
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:39,350
third and dr. Stephen banister and I

7
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:40,820
personally am very thrilled to be doing

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,559
this because these are two of my

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,590
favorite people

10
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:49,070
dr. Bannister has been in medical

11
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:52,550
practice in our community for 42 years I

12
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:56,619
think you said and 20-some years of that

13
00:00:52,549 --> 00:01:00,859
22 years more or less he has risked his

14
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:04,099
medical license because the California

15
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:06,829
Medical Board gets nervous about doctors

16
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:09,829
who actually practice with the cannabis

17
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:12,679
advised people to use cannabis and dr.

18
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:16,780
Bannister has for the last 22 years at

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,310
Highland Springs then helping patients

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,439
understand how to use cannabis in

21
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:25,519
treating the conditions that they are

22
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:28,579
subject to and that has been a scary

23
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,949
thing at times I would guess as he says

24
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:36,530
the the Medical Board can get nervous or

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:43,310
jumpy any time forced hurt I don't even

26
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:45,920
know where to start this gentleman is he

27
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:49,430
comes to medical cannabis out of direct

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,420
personal need in his own family and his

29
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:55,159
son is subject to most of the types of

30
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,230
seizures that have been identified in

31
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:01,609
the time that I've known for us that's

32
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:04,640
coming on for years now there have been

33
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:07,459
months at a time when Silas was free of

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,060
seizures thanks to certain cannabis

35
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:12,439
medications that we had access to and on

36
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,110
the other hand especially in the last

37
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:17,689
few months it's been a pretty relentless

38
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,480
nightmare of ongoing seizures and in the

39
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:23,590
midst of all of that in his own life he

40
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:26,060
has made time and space and put effort

41
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,069
into creating an entity called the

42
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,709
khalad rias Network which has been

43
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:32,188
providing cannabis preparations to

44
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:36,420
families

45
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:38,218
at no cost to those families and many of

46
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:41,098
those preparations are custom formulated

47
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:42,900
for the needs of those children and in

48
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:45,238
order to qualify for khalad Reyes the

49
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,340
child has to be in a situation of what's

50
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,658
known as catastrophic ly ill which means

51
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,299
Western medicine does not have an answer

52
00:02:51,658 --> 00:03:00,138
for this condition and it is typically

53
00:02:54,299 --> 00:03:02,549
fatal and that's enforced yes so today

54
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:05,099
what I'd like to do is hear from these

55
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:08,730
two people about the state of medical

56
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:11,250
cannabis in California today and some of

57
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:13,018
the exciting possibilities that are out

58
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,500
there of in therapeutic possibilities

59
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,789
and some of the dilemmas that are going

60
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,639
on and so with that

61
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:23,358
who what do you think guys who wants to

62
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,959
start I'm gonna shut up for a minute oh

63
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,959
well thank you

64
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:48,370
and we'll see what we get from there so

65
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:52,000
as Wade mentioned I started researching

66
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,939
medical cannabis very seriously about

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,039
seven years ago and with my son was

68
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:00,090
diagnosed with a condition called

69
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,590
lennox-gastaut syndrome which is

70
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,509
considered a rare catastrophic form of

71
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,340
epilepsy because it really intractable

72
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:09,789
type of epilepsy meaning it doesn't

73
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,920
respond medications they totally had

74
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:14,139
multiple seizure types to documented ten

75
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,899
different types of seizures and many of

76
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:19,418
these don't even really have a name with

77
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:22,870
him and you know he went from a healthy

78
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:26,409
boy - you know he had his first seizure

79
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,079
it was you know a matter of weeks not

80
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,790
months when he had his second seizure it

81
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,949
was a matter of months you know not

82
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,729
years when he was having seizures every

83
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:38,978
day and within a year year and a half he

84
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:41,110
was having hundreds of seizures a month

85
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:43,750
yeah by the time he was five

86
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,660
he was having around 2,500 seizures a

87
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,819
month so we just watch this is this

88
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:52,030
rapid decline and I had worked in

89
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:55,149
pediatric mental health for 15 years

90
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:59,849
with it's with different mental health

91
00:04:55,149 --> 00:05:02,019
conditions environmental and genetic

92
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,660
causes of different mental health

93
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:07,659
conditions and you know my son became

94
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,780
ill that took years of experience to

95
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,880
really researching where the science was

96
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,409
connect dial because at that point they

97
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,870
didn't think he was gonna

98
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,530
at all they told us we would never live

99
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:25,209
to see they attend how could they say

100
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:29,549
he's 12 now but that that's how I came

101
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:35,739
into it so I studied it a lot more

102
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:37,810
feverishly the maybe most because and

103
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,689
out of that experience we started

104
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,519
working with local politics trying to

105
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:46,469
measure W hearing about how we defeat

106
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:48,669
you which we were able to do and that

107
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,030
type of attention that attracted other

108
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,160
families with similar types of kids

109
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:56,709
wondering if they could get help because

110
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,380
we weren't able to get services seizures

111
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:01,000
after a lot of work a lot of different

112
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:04,990
cultivation of specific strains of

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,990
plants to stop at one point they stopped

114
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,759
for six seven months and even with the

115
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,360
seizure she's having now compared to

116
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:17,920
2,500 miles we still have on average by

117
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,470
the 90% seizure reduction now my because

118
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,840
10% of 2500 is still a lot of procedures

119
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,050
right but you know if we're talking

120
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:28,959
about statistically as far as other

121
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,000
anti-seizure drugs and success rates it

122
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,799
blows every other context you throw them

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,519
in the water

124
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:39,759
considering they had zero that 90% is

125
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:42,219
pretty pretty incredible so the

126
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,560
coagulant worked was performance of

127
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:48,520
collectors like a lot of medical patient

128
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,750
collectives and what a lot of people

129
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:56,709
don't realize is when passed Proposition

130
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:59,350
64 we sunset the clock so it was a

131
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:00,649
constant SB 4:20 that was sunset to

132
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:07,189
expire on January

133
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:10,159
to 2018 so the collaboration will the

134
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:12,288
VCC was supposed to write laws and

135
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,660
nonprofits they said they were too busy

136
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:17,629
and didn't have time to get it finished

137
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,689
so Governor Brown allowed them to push

138
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:24,649
that date back to January 19th of 29th

139
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:26,990
of January 1919 but he didn't push back

140
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:28,370
the sunset at the collective model cuz

141
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,210
they were on the same day so what's

142
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:34,610
happening is the collaboost network was

143
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:36,709
forced to shut down On January of this

144
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,960
year in the time that we were working

145
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:41,388
what we were doing was working with you

146
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:45,109
know terminally ill children so

147
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:47,538
intractable epilepsy cancer and I worked

148
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,280
really hard with the skinny and horrible

149
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:51,439
skin condition called epidermolysis

150
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,329
bullosa which is probably the worst

151
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,829
thing I've ever seen in my life

152
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:59,598
if you look it up fair warning it's hard

153
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:02,120
you don't see it what these kids are

154
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,879
going so we were working with with

155
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:13,098
horrible diseases where kids typically

156
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:17,209
don't work out of their teens cancer

157
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:18,589
treatment and we were able to collect

158
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:20,509
front of the farmers here in Nevada

159
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:22,519
County we were able to collect donations

160
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,740
we ran programs at two for Tots program

161
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,779
to give pharmacists without to plants

162
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,449
and we collect them we were able to pick

163
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:31,429
those in do the extractions ourselves we

164
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:33,320
had a lab in Sacramento that was

165
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:37,129
voluntary new testaments we're able to

166
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,469
get all that safety testing done and we

167
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:42,019
I would make the preparations based on

168
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:44,028
the lab results in our kitchen for these

169
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:46,159
kids individually

170
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:47,870
especially with rare epilepsy

171
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,328
they really needed a specific

172
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:54,198
formulation for that specific ring we

173
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:57,859
get him to that point that is later and

174
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:59,838
I'm proud to say we worked publicly for

175
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,240
two years so we ran senators family some

176
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,649
parents belong a good man but when we

177
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,028
got to shut down I'm replying to the

178
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:07,370
breath and went back and look we were

179
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:16,009
able to donate 1.2 million dollars worth

180
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:17,240
of medicine to over a hundred over 150

181
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:21,350
of those families who wants to work on

182
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,899
home talk now the question was and I'm

183
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,939
getting to the point I promise what's

184
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:29,299
the current standard of medical cannabis

185
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:33,620
yeah I think that backstory is important

186
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:36,078
to understand actually how the same

187
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,889
about disease is true because it's not

188
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:42,169
one that we hear very off from my

189
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:44,180
perspective a no medical cannabis is a

190
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:45,919
spectrum right for a lot of patients

191
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:50,508
with with conditions that are treated

192
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:53,088
with simple or easy treatments like

193
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:55,399
flower wilting flower medical cannabis

194
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:57,410
is no good because here we have a lot

195
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,438
more access in legality than they have

196
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:02,539
before when we get into catastrophic

197
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:04,849
illness the illnesses that I'm used to

198
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:07,480
working with that my son has

199
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:12,579
it is worse now than it was

200
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:15,278
- it's hard now it's more dangerous now

201
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:19,149
as far as the legal ramifications then

202
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:22,870
it was since before proper 15 to 15 was

203
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:25,028
back and I think I'll let that hang

204
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,539
there for a while and talk about why

205
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:30,730
that is

206
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:35,860
it's we move on but as of today it is

207
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:38,800
there's no legal way at all for myself

208
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,419
to give the medicine silencers let alone

209
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:52,349
the individual meds all those other

210
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:52,349
children use yeah I think yeah prop

211
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:06,259
you sure that we really understand what

212
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:08,149
he just said yes the regulatory

213
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:10,009
framework called legalization in

214
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:13,519
California this is one of the unintended

215
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:16,159
side effects or consequences of what

216
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,509
legalization has done all of the

217
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,500
compassion programs of any sort in

218
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:25,399
California are facing the same

219
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:28,370
predicament that calabria network is and

220
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,339
what's really tragic about it is the

221
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,820
need for these preparations has not

222
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:38,000
stopped just the opportunity to do so

223
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:41,329
has become again Federalist in the

224
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,149
legalization framework so I'm gonna stop

225
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:56,870
and I would invite dr. Bannister now to

226
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:58,519
share with us we turned it on then

227
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,940
that'd be different all right that's

228
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,610
different

229
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:05,480
thank you wave at me back there go hey

230
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:07,778
you're not on the drug policy Alliance

231
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,519
is one of the several nationwide

232
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:13,578
advocacy groups there's several of them

233
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,860
I like most of them Marijuana Policy

234
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:17,599
Project all that anyway I just got this

235
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,820
from the drug policy Alliance in the

236
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,430
mail and it says marijuana is not legal

237
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,980
we've seen gains however marijuana

238
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:29,689
arrests for possession increased to six

239
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,769
hundred thousand and twenty seventeen

240
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:35,450
that's one arrest every 53 seconds so in

241
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:37,250
two hundred forty seven million people

242
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:40,610
still live in states where marijuana is

243
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:43,519
not legal so as forces and access to

244
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:46,278
this hugely difficult people have moved

245
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,259
to Colorado from Tennessee and all over

246
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:51,679
the country that their kids could get

247
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:54,679
some CBD which is the predominant one

248
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:58,250
that has helped see predominance of

249
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:00,229
these difficult seizures so yeah we

250
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,220
we've gotten part of the way but we're

251
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:07,529
still another huge

252
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:14,160
mess and that's yeah it's not good

253
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:15,569
so the Mike I didn't know what audience

254
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,819
I was gonna get to talk to you today so

255
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:21,480
maybe I'll find out as we go along with

256
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:24,410
small but mighty and one of the things I

257
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:29,100
wanted to put out is that I think

258
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:31,679
cannabis is the future of medicine and I

259
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,259
think there's ways to get there and the

260
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,679
ways are very important as we're seeing

261
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:39,750
the ways that we're going is not always

262
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,059
working right now it's working against

263
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,269
forests and these kids so that wasn't

264
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:47,519
the intention was to make this more

265
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:51,809
difficult but that's what it's doing in

266
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,980
this situation the the the way it

267
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:59,309
becomes the future of medicine is that

268
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,320
cannabis is so extremely useful so I've

269
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:03,659
been a doctor 46 years I've been every

270
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,640
kind of doc a ER doc and a family

271
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:07,709
practice doc and whatever and I've

272
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,470
treated most everything and I've treated

273
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:13,110
things with regular prescriptions and

274
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,000
and herbs and acupuncture and every damn

275
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,970
thing I could think of I found kenick

276
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,259
cannabis to be the most useful and safe

277
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,259
medicine I've ever used

278
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,169
you
