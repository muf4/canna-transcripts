1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
lo and behold when the first labs come

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:07,019
out that was steep hill was first and

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,880
pure analytics pure Linux comes out

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,230
Samantha Millers of brilliant scientists

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,120
so I meet her

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,548
and she says hey I can do predicated

7
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:15,838
work and I'm like nice let's look into

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,698
predicated work and find out what's

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,439
going on we start to take a look at

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,520
what's taking place with Lawrence's work

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,500
and what we're doing with the canna

12
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,018
tonic line and we start pulling out the

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,079
outliers that let us breed these lines

14
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:29,309
to get a greater stability Lawrence ends

15
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,320
up passing away from Ken's

16
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,719
cancer he gives me this whole collection

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,579
I then diffuse it into the cannabis

18
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,870
community so that it's in the hands of

19
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,840
individuals and I put on all these

20
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,699
programs on how to cultivate and then I

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,660
put him in touch with extractors that

22
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,120
have the ability to do medical

23
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:49,378
extraction so that all these patients

24
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:52,049
would be self-sustaining I I pry wasn't

25
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,359
a medical guy prior I'm a historic

26
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:57,299
black-market cultivator technician

27
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,719
trafficker and so I take over dispensary

28
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:02,819
eleven years ago and I get humanized

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,469
from the experience because I see real

30
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,239
need for medical stuff and I'm like why

31
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:07,379
these people are absolutely dying and it

32
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,329
tripped me outside never been around

33
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,569
people don't die before I see people die

34
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:14,400
from gunshots and I seen you not slow

35
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:15,779
death and I did not know what it looked

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,430
like and I didn't realize that you could

37
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,689
replace so much medicine from cannabis

38
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,700
thank you and so I went on this run so I

39
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:26,008
I'm involved in the foundation of modern

40
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,560
CVD and I say hey this is gonna be

41
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,900
awesome and then lo and behold they

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,728
start to mine Kentucky hemp Chinese hemp

43
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,770
because people say hey we can just use

44
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:36,688
this and it works and it does work to a

45
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,478
degree but the efficiency isn't the same

46
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:40,589
and the the overall spectrum of benefits

47
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:42,509
isn't the same because you're not

48
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,670
receiving they want to give you CBD

49
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,319
alone but CBD has to have some THC

50
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,450
present in order to be optimized for

51
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,599
uptake yeah because the way the

52
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,549
receptors release and recover it you get

53
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,408
a longer recovery rate longest sickle

54
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,409
grade in the body if we have THC present

55
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:05,839
below point three but it's not that it

56
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,270
doesn't have any THC present it's just

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,009
that hemp wasn't selected for smoking

58
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,080
purposes oh sorry

59
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,509
hemp wasn't selected for smoking

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,910
purposes fiber purposes only and so what

61
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:19,969
I realized as just this revelation was

62
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:21,530
that none of us smoked landrace cannabis

63
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:22,789
as much as people think it's landrace

64
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,370
it's not

65
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:28,250
they took landrace populations and they

66
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,909
chose the plants they wanted to use for

67
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,680
their patches propagated it cultivated

68
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:36,319
it and then they kept the males they

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,659
wanted to pollinate the seed for next

70
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,729
year into the females they wanted to use

71
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,710
for next year as soon as man touches

72
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:44,810
that shit to cultivate a variety Lynne

73
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,189
race is naturally occurring so what they

74
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,670
could do in Afghanistan

75
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:51,650
Africa is they could go to bat is they

76
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,449
could go into land raise populations and

77
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,159
find the outliers that lived through the

78
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:56,929
drought that year live through the

79
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,129
locust the ones that lived through the

80
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,960
locusts they could then add to the

81
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:02,389
genealogical population the ones that

82
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,700
survived this new pathogenic issue added

83
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:07,429
to the genealogical population so I get

84
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:10,069
the genealogical information present but

85
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,489
fundamentally that cannabis was used as

86
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:16,009
medicine and it was used in CVD form if

87
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:18,950
you're equatorial and I and just because

88
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:20,389
I got to see so much data I started

89
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,639
going I got you everything that we

90
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:25,099
consider psychoactive on spiritual use

91
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,539
stuff we want heady weed that all comes

92
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,370
from zero to twenty on the equator

93
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,049
that's what people had incredible

94
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,450
lifestyle where you're plenty of water

95
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,189
you didn't have to worry about freezing

96
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:36,229
to death in the winter it wasn't over

97
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:37,609
ninety degrees because it's never that

98
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:39,289
hot on the equator excites to work on

99
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,480
the equator so something hot it's just

100
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:43,489
incredible sun intensity and then you

101
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:46,159
start to get above twenty to forty and

102
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,230
it's in the 30s that we're talking

103
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,789
afghanistan pakistan where you have some

104
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:52,429
of the most savage weather known to

105
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:55,250
mankind and no water and so i started

106
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,900
realizing that it breaks down really

107
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,629
pretty well where the easier your life

108
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,480
was is where you cultivated spiritual

109
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:05,329
cerebral cannabis and the more you moved

110
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:08,000
away from the zero towards the forty

111
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,250
where basically it ended all normal

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,300
cannabis production you started having

113
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,039
CBD

114
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,579
dominant cannabis on one to one ratio

115
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:19,159
cannabis and nope not Hardy are better

116
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,889
for you to consume Hardy are in a sense

117
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,810
that it works in that environment but

118
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:25,669
not harder if you bring it down to the

119
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,800
equator because it has to have an

120
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,480
ability to work with all all stuff we're

121
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,920
talking about over the 30 and that range

122
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,629
is high desert

123
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,569
yeah because high desert is is

124
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:37,819
considered in a definition less than 10

125
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:39,769
inches of rain a year so I need to have

126
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,089
a different type of root system and I

127
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:42,529
need to have a different type of leaf

128
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:44,989
structure to be a more efficient

129
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:47,929
radiator and I have to have an ability

130
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,629
to control desiccation more so higher

131
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,340
trichome levels because trikes really do

132
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:56,240
help desiccation the drying out of the

133
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:59,419
flower and then lo and behold how do you

134
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,129
hold flower in Morocco you can't and so

135
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,230
when I started getting into hash making

136
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,899
probably like we see that would have

137
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:08,060
been around same 99 2000 I started doing

138
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:09,829
all my water process back then I had a

139
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,050
lady who had lived in Morocco for about

140
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:13,099
four years and she was showing us what

141
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,750
we she was what we were doing she goes

142
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,669
you guys are not letting this shit dry

143
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,439
out enough she said you have to take it

144
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:21,199
to zero and so I started coming up with

145
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,850
my own drying systems in pizza boxes and

146
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,219
then I used big commercial coffee

147
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,780
grinders to do the micro planing so a me

148
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,340
and Brandon hook up from third Jenny was

149
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:31,849
dying because I was using coffee

150
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:33,289
grinders to microplane 15 years ago but

151
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,050
what it did was it let me make really

152
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,939
high quality bubble and we had access to

153
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,500
truckloads of shake at the time coming

154
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:41,660
out all the huge massive endure so it

155
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,519
was a waste product so I had all these

156
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,550
massive operations where we would run

157
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,930
all the the ice water hash through the

158
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,879
systems and then run it through the

159
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,980
filtration and then we would dry it in

160
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,600
the pizza racks in the house and then

161
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,520
micro it and then run it through die

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,220
presses that I had welders whip up for

163
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,139
me and then once the material once they

164
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,270
got tired of that varietal I would just

165
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,129
repress it and who died so I would throw

166
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:05,389
out a brand new die repress it again and

167
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:06,829
it would come out as a brand new product

168
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:08,300
as far as the stove was concerned oh my

169
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,889
god that's a much better product same

170
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,750
product in another form it's kind of

171
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:13,069
like the turkey bag phenomenon you bring

172
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,540
it to me one turkey bag they don't want

173
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:15,860
it you go back in the house bring it

174
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,470
back in another turkey bag they'll take

175
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,569
it they'll take it exactly they'll take

176
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,070
it they don't know the difference and we

177
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:23,569
know that so we would deliver a really

178
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,079
high-quality product but you start to

179
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:27,348
see the new

180
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:29,060
as a perception but the point was she

181
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:31,250
was telling me that they have tins the

182
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,740
way they tin up the hash in Morocco

183
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,439
where they're holding it for years with

184
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,449
no mold no hold ability so I started

185
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,759
realizing I got you it's because the

186
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:42,710
flower degrades so quickly in these very

187
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,629
low humidity environments that they

188
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:46,579
can't hold flower and that's why hash

189
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,560
production was valuable for these

190
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:49,939
individuals but if you were to look at

191
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,709
the hash from any of those countries

192
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:53,509
they would have a way more balanced

193
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:55,848
keema type you'd see a much more

194
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,250
dominant CVD ratio so not

195
00:06:55,848 --> 00:07:01,610
disproportionate but more like a 1 to 1

196
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,168
or a 1 to 0.5 so when I started getting

197
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,669
all the Pakistani genetics getting

198
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:07,038
shipped in from the Pakistani hash

199
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:10,639
fields the first thing I did was propped

200
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,959
it all up and then sent it to the lab so

201
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,269
I could start to take a look at it on

202
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,589
predicated and then it let me understand

203
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:18,019
what was inside and that's when I

204
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:20,388
started realizing this hypothesis I

205
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:22,878
started being put together a lifetime of

206
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:25,759
doing this and saying whoa the data says

207
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,680
this which makes sense for what we think

208
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,810
therefore that's what it is

209
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,038
so I know that with all these varietals

210
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,449
that came through all the original

211
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,269
Afghan E's if you run all those

212
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:37,718
originals in like 9% yeah low numbers

213
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:40,278
man we skewed them and then

214
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:43,009
unfortunately the store fronts are

215
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:45,829
obsessed with numerix and it completely

216
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:50,180
screws up the reality of cannabis it

217
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:52,579
screws it up as the fruits come in the

218
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,288
fruits are coming in because and that's

219
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,750
about it strip levels now so now it's

220
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:59,089
skewed syrup levels and I have stuff

221
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:02,149
that's 2.6 on a total term that's

222
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:03,739
ungodly quality that's you would say it

223
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,689
has five times the syrup levels of a

224
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,728
five percent because the numbers don't

225
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:09,110
quantify it it's like saying you know I

226
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:10,848
always use yeah you're pretty but you're

227
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,229
not a nice person so yeah you can add a

228
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:13,848
hundred pretty points and you keep

229
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:15,439
adding pretty points keep bad don't keep

230
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:16,939
adding them it doesn't change the fact

231
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,560
that you suck to be around so I'm good

232
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:20,750
now just get the fuck out of the car and

233
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,269
and that's how it is to me with cannabis

234
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,860
weird no there's no reality and it's the

235
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,318
only way to perceive this stuff in real

236
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,270
life is to understand that there's

237
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,500
things that you can use in context to

238
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:33,168
understand where we're going wrong with

239
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,448
what we're doing now and and as the

240
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:36,740
reality comes in and people become more

241
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,449
educated it'll be a lot

242
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,669
that's why when I get to mess around

243
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,170
with Abrams where at first you know they

244
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,519
were aggressive when this just like the

245
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:45,699
wine industry I get all these top wine

246
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,259
execs come in and they attacked me on

247
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,610
judging judging weed because they go we

248
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:51,950
want to take over the industry and how

249
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,450
Somalia is run it and I said the key

250
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,910
difference between you and I my friend

251
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,370
is that you're judging flavonoids and

252
00:08:55,909 --> 00:09:00,620
ethyl alcohol so no matter what alcohol

253
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:04,639
you playing with it's the same basic

254
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:07,399
booze at the lack of all you are you can

255
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,649
put it in your mouth and spit it out you

256
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,120
can't spit out the cannabinoids and it's

257
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,549
the cannabinoids that the effect is

258
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,200
dominated by so you have to be able to

259
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:16,939
so eventually it traumatize them because

260
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,040
they said you basically have to be a

261
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,660
career weed smoker to be able to do it

262
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,069
and I said yeah because I am yeah

263
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:23,899
because I'm gonna be able to smoke 40

264
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,600
varieties and tell you that was the one

265
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,449
that worked and and and so when I hang

266
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,769
out with normal individuals they're like

267
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,300
you're a drug addict because they watch

268
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,159
me smoke so much I'm like no I'm not

269
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:36,469
drug addict it's just that I can

270
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,769
function normally on high levels of

271
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,540
intoxication and I can discern this was

272
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,980
the one that worked and if you put them

273
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,929
all back in the cookie jar I'll still

274
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,700
pull the same one out over and over

275
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:48,889
again because that's what we do for a

276
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,540
living it's not me it's other people

277
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:52,759
like me if you're a Korea you're Korea

278
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:54,620
and the wine guys finally were like

279
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,909
alright alright so then we had a better

280
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,919
relationship because they weren't being

281
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:59,629
so adversarial because they're very

282
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,209
intelligent most of them are PhD

283
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:04,399
scientists and in viticulture lists in

284
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,230
Somali a and sort of them there's like

285
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,449
the top of the food chain and how things

286
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,500
are perceived but I can smoke them some

287
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,550
reefer and they're on their hands and

288
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,429
knees begging for me to take them home

289
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:16,579
so I can put them on into a cot so I'm

290
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:20,209
just like you're judging anybody so we

291
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:22,160
we know that to be true and you and you

292
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,800
need to be able to say hey these are the

293
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,779
things that happen in the public is the

294
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,789
same way so when I get academics to come

295
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,889
in each individual that comes into

296
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:33,799
cannabis wants to disprove what you do

297
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:37,309
and because you're not one of their

298
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:39,349
peers you must not be as sharp and so

299
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:41,750
there for a lifetime of doing this at

300
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,509
every level humanly possible doesn't

301
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,909
mean anything we know this from this and

302
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,899
what they find out is that they're

303
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,759
mistaken

304
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,649
and then you end up building a

305
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,419
relationship so now you can actually

306
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,759
share because I don't pretend to be a

307
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:58,069
scientist I'm not I am fascinated with

308
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,889
science and I use scientists but I'm a

309
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,770
field operator that's what I'm about I'm

310
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:06,409
about getting product to the table and

311
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:09,009
I'm about helping farmers get product to

312
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:09,009
the table
