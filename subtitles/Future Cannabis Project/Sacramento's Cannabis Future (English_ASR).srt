[Music]

2
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,980
you know one of the things that I'm

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,949
always curious is really around the

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:25,768
market size right particularly around

5
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,289
delivery I think we've got a pretty good

6
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:33,140
handle on at least what we believe the

7
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:37,109
size of the market for our storefront is

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,600
but you know but what do you think the

9
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:40,738
the size of the you know greater

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Sacramento area

11
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:47,128
you know delivery market is I know so

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,140
I'm not the only reason I jumped into

13
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,549
Oakland was because that was the easiest

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,259
place to get licensing but I'm a lot

15
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:55,799
more familiar with the Sacramento market

16
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,479
I think on weed maps horrible topic to

17
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,009
bring up and home weed masturbate on

18
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,038
weed Maps beginning of the year there

19
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:04,259
was about 140 150 delivery services and

20
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,769
they were all thriving and operating in

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,270
an equilibrium but now we're legal ones

22
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:11,158
they were definitely not legal but they

23
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,709
were they were thriving operating but

24
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,380
now we have in the city of Sacramento I

25
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:18,329
think 70 applicants right correct we

26
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,728
have seven of the applications for non

27
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:22,438
storefront delivery right now so I think

28
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:25,590
that it would be reasonable to say that

29
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,599
we can we can sustain another 70 to get

30
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,840
back to that level of equilibrium at

31
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:33,750
about 140 to 150 operators and have fair

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,609
market share for each each operator do

33
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,799
you think it's is how large is is the

34
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:42,328
size of the of the retail delivery

35
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,299
market relative to storefronts do you

36
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:47,789
think is it is it 25% is it half I've

37
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,920
heard numbers all the way from half down

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:54,899
to a very specific 12% man anybody that

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,640
has a very specific percent like that is

40
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,868
really watching their analytics but I

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,849
would say I would say it's about half

42
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,769
the market just because every every

43
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,328
delivery driver can only complete so

44
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,789
many deliveries in a day versus a

45
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:07,859
storefront can take in an unlimited

46
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,649
amount of foot traffic so they have they

47
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,919
have that advantage there so it's you

48
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,598
know just just in my experience and I

49
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,309
I actually had a dispensary in LA as

50
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:18,229
well previously to have him that's why I

51
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,640
moved into delivery was because the

52
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:22,488
market was so saturated down here and I

53
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,769
would say it's a roughly 50% the

54
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:27,069
business that you're able to conduct

55
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,239
with the storefront compared to delivery

56
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:31,969
Sacramento has been on the forefront of

57
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,840
the industry as a whole since January 1

58
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:35,680
they've really tried to push the

59
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,550
envelope and make make a lot happen

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,110
beforehand and be one of the cities that

61
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,319
was out in front of the problem to be a

62
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,870
pioneer for for other cities to use as

63
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,699
an example Joe would be a lot more

64
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,900
familiar with with the trials and

65
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,639
tribulations that have come with that

66
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,709
cuz I know there's been a lot of

67
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,469
victories but then he also comes to

68
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:58,519
blame when things don't go right so ii

69
00:02:54,469 --> 00:03:01,370
was definitely not berkeley you know and

70
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,159
i I love I love Berkeley I love the Bay

71
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,700
Area but Sacramento is you know always

72
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:11,539
been much more you know moderate and all

73
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:13,518
of its politics relative to the coastal

74
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:19,039
cities I mean we are a Central Valley

75
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:22,370
City I think were we what we have been

76
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:25,519
is just is very pragmatic and realistic

77
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,459
about cannabis I think the council and

78
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,250
mayor showed early leadership on a

79
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,069
complicated subject and at that moment

80
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,349
at least politically when they really

81
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:39,590
acknowledged that you know what we have

82
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:45,199
cannabis in their community the last 30

83
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:48,500
years of prohibitions and enforcement on

84
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,629
and the war on drugs did nothing to

85
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,780
remove cannabis from our community and

86
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:55,699
so let's try something different and you

87
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,560
know the people were collecting

88
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:59,780
signatures and they were gonna they were

89
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,530
gonna put this bowel initiative on the

90
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,810
on the ballot and you know and we saw

91
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,699
that coming and and we had conversations

92
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,799
with like okay we think this thing is

93
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:11,568
going to qualify for the bout and if it

94
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,299
gets on we're pretty sure this time

95
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:16,909
around it's gonna pass and so we took

96
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:21,019
steps early on to proactively develop a

97
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,310
regulatory framework that wasn't wasn't

98
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,050
easy

99
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:28,819
there are a lot of internal battles

100
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:30,918
around you know what do we need to do in

101
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:33,829
order to prepare for that and you know

102
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:36,109
where does this you know where does this

103
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:39,560
permitting Authority need to you know

104
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:42,199
even live within the city and there are

105
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,290
still you know small battles every day

106
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,389
around you know how do we how do we do

107
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,340
this and how do we do this better so

108
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,840
after the district six cap was

109
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:52,310
implemented do you see that rolling out

110
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,469
across all the other districts do you

111
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,060
see that impeding us in the city of

112
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,550
Sacramento as operators reaching that

113
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,168
150 target market where we once we're at

114
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:08,629
I don't were worried where I actually

115
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:12,549
see this potentially going is and and

116
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:14,659
someone might have my head for this but

117
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,220
look as I think as we gain more

118
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,960
experiences I think we can have more

119
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,540
informed conversations around what is a

120
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,159
rational reasonable policy and maybe the

121
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,600
two and a half million square foot cap

122
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,680
that we have currently in Council

123
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,600
District six

124
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:32,530
stays forever maybe after some of those

125
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:37,160
come online and a lot of it is

126
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:39,529
distribution that maybe shouldn't be

127
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,300
applied towards that cap maybe we should

128
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:44,299
have that conversation about pulling out

129
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:48,110
distribution and you know maybe there's

130
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,300
a conversation we had around lifting

131
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,050
that cap around you know after we have

132
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,579
some more data on what those impacts

133
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,620
potentially are you know one of the

134
00:05:55,579 --> 00:06:00,978
things that we well we have a cap we

135
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,620
don't have we don't have to now familiar

136
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:07,399
square feet of applications yeah and so

137
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:10,310
there's still some property speculation

138
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,810
I guess within that part of the market

139
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,668
and so I think it's going to take a

140
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,189
little bit of time to figure out but I

141
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:19,339
think as we get more data we'll have

142
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:19,980
more informed conversations policy is

143
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:22,769
released

144
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,900
it's gonna be never-ending I mean this

145
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:30,449
is pretty much the you know attorney

146
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:32,009
full Employment Act so you know I think

147
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:37,500
like everything else Candice related

148
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:39,089
it's gonna be an evolution I was

149
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,550
surprised to hear that from Lori earlier

150
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:43,500
to talking about the regulations

151
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,020
everybody was under the assumption this

152
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,189
was it after these final edits and she

153
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,069
said this is gonna be an evolving

154
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:52,589
process over the next coming years this

155
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,240
may very well not be it so I can I can

156
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:55,199
imagine on the city level it's gonna be

157
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,730
the same as well

158
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,319
absolutely you know the the realities is

159
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:06,120
that this industry is going to continue

160
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:09,449
to innovate much quicker than anyone can

161
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:14,490
regulate and so industry is going to get

162
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:16,979
out in front of regulation you know call

163
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,139
it a loophole whatever you want to call

164
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,830
it but they're going to innovate to meet

165
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,139
customer and consumer demands and

166
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:28,439
regulation by nature is going to be you

167
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:31,169
know behind that innovation and so we're

168
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,149
gonna have to continuously adopt what we

169
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:37,699
do and how we do it if we're ever gonna

170
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:42,449
I think help this help the consumer

171
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:44,849
transition into that legal space as well

172
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:47,819
as helping the cannabis businesses

173
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:51,600
himself trans transition into that legal

174
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,099
space do you think on-site consumption

175
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,740
is on the menu for the city of

176
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,390
Sacramento coming soon I don't know

177
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,269
about soon I think we're gonna have that

178
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:02,099
conversation beginning early next year

179
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:07,229
we're going to start it at the policy

180
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:09,110
committee and in the city it's you know

181
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,600
we'll see where it goes I think this is

182
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:15,060
anti consumption is is going to be

183
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,660
really where each community is going to

184
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:21,959
have to really kind of dig deep and and

185
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:26,040
and make some you know big choices

186
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:27,399
around around what that looks like

187
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,800
in their community

188
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:31,209
I think between the on-site consumption

189
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,908
that's possible with dispensaries and

190
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:37,649
now these special events that can take

191
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:39,879
place outside of County Fairgrounds

192
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:44,500
on-site consumption is going to look

193
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:47,980
very different in again probably in a

194
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:51,750
short period of time in different cities

195
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:54,610
San Francisco has an absolute need to

196
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:58,740
have a very robust conversation around

197
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:01,980
on-site consumption in places other than

198
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,899
other than you know this handful of

199
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,420
dispensaries they have so many people

200
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:10,329
that come to that city every day that

201
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:13,088
stay in hotels and Airbnb s

202
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,970
and some percentage of those folks smoke

203
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:17,920
cannabis and so in addition to the

204
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,300
population there that smokes cannabis

205
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:24,519
I've heard that some people smoke

206
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:25,449
cannabis in San Francisco you know so

207
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,088
they're gonna have to have that

208
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,650
conversation you know do they do they

209
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:32,890
allow a lot of these events to take

210
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,299
place in you know Golden Gate Park I

211
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:35,708
think the other piece that's interesting

212
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:39,189
as it relates to on-site consumption is

213
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:42,579
you know is there a conversation we had

214
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,620
around designated consumption areas so

215
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,839
it's not that consumption can only take

216
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,089
place at a dispensary but it's the

217
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,060
proverbial yoga studio I get an email

218
00:09:49,089 --> 00:10:00,190
week from a yoga studio hey can we smoke

219
00:09:52,059 --> 00:10:02,229
before class you know is the answer but

220
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:05,740
you know is there a way where that could

221
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:08,409
be done you know safely and respectfully

222
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,750
to the community around it you know and

223
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:12,189
then cities you know that are you know

224
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:17,230
very dense can have those conversations

225
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:20,010
like okay we've got a thousand people a

226
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:23,170
day smoking cannabis in this park

227
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:26,049
do we want to acknowledge that that's

228
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:28,360
happening you know and and put some kind

229
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:31,750
of you know framework around it around

230
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,389
how we would like it to happen you know

231
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,889
otherwise you're looking at you know

232
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:37,299
really just rules that you're not

233
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:41,500
enforcing and I don't

234
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:43,479
that does anybody any good at speaking

235
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,179
to temporary events so in the interim

236
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,039
while the city wraps its mind around the

237
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,229
discussion of on-site consumption is

238
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,958
there a possibility for temporary events

239
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,120
to occur in Sacramento 4 and an

240
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,379
allowable on-site consumption for those

241
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,679
temporary events or is that something

242
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:01,000
the city is going to hold off on until

243
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:05,889
on-site consumption is completely ironed

244
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,570
out as a whole no we're gonna i'm very

245
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:10,059
intentionally trying to bifurcate those

246
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:14,230
those two issues i think that they are

247
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:15,939
well related though can the conversation

248
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:21,399
on on-site consumption is incredibly

249
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:22,690
more complicated and political so we're

250
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,240
gonna be moving forward with an

251
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,890
ordinance to allow what would

252
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,610
essentially allow the city manager to

253
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:34,980
approve special events that would take

254
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,980
place at a County fairground and then

255
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:40,480
and then I think if the early part of

256
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,250
next year will address the the new state

257
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,990
bill that would potentially allow us to

258
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:49,708
have special events at places outside of

259
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:53,680
outside of the County fairground

260
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:57,369
it's for local governments and for local

261
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:59,500
elected it's just a lot I mean I feel

262
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:03,700
like I bring an item agenda item before

263
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,470
them every week and and and and they get

264
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,230
a little you know tight they get a

265
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,459
little tired of talking about cannabis

266
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,289
you know they have other things to do

267
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:14,828
they're trying to you know run entire

268
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:17,769
cities and be responsive to the totality

269
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:20,889
of a community's needs and not just this

270
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:22,778
one particular thing you know over time

271
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:27,549
it will die down over time it's gonna be

272
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:29,350
a little bit more normal but you know

273
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:32,979
we're gonna we've been taking a steady

274
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,659
incremental approach to this and we're

275
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,370
gonna I think kind of keep plugging away

276
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:40,778
at it until it's until it's done

277
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:44,169
something I've seen come up in a couple

278
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:46,509
of different cities and I know from

279
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:48,639
somebody else that I work with is the

280
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:50,289
tiered tax measure so if somebody like

281
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,830
myself who's looking to vertically

282
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:53,289
integrate and

283
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,090
city of Sacramento every every

284
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:58,120
operational standpoint is effectively

285
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,220
taxed at the 5% so it'd be manufacturing

286
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,080
distribution cultivation and then

287
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,910
delivery retail that would collect the

288
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,530
four percent or 5 percent attack of

289
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:07,990
being an effective twenty percent tax

290
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:10,629
measure on top of excise tax and the

291
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,730
other taxes is that something that the

292
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:14,740
city can consider I know that the city

293
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,019
is already trying to are talking about

294
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,970
micro business licensing is there a way

295
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:23,590
to consolidate those to be a single

296
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:29,620
business tax or is a we are we are

297
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:33,129
absolutely looking at that like I think

298
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,690
everything cannabis related it's been a

299
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:37,620
lot we've tried to get it right the

300
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:40,510
first time and you quickly realize that

301
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,220
you know maybe if you're lucky got it

302
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:44,919
mostly right we've begun the

303
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:50,550
conversation around our current tax

304
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:55,120
structure and how to not just remain

305
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:57,789
competitive within the region compared

306
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,700
to other cities but you know primarily

307
00:13:57,789 --> 00:14:02,740
the goal is ensuring that businesses are

308
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,780
successful because that's the only way

309
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,120
the illicit market goes away we need

310
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:11,470
successful legal cannabis businesses

311
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,389
that consumers can access so we'll be

312
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:17,040
having that conversation I expect that

313
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:20,750
to probably start becoming more

314
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,750
more public in the next couple of months

315
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,878
you

316
