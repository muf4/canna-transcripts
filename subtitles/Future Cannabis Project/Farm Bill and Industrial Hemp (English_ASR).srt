1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,969
you know what's happening with a little

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:04,859
bit with the farm bill and what the

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,299
expectation is there and you know we

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,690
just brought the whole CBD side of

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,250
having you know dual use there so I

6
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:14,129
think we're we're watching a lot of

7
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,719
people think that you know the farm bill

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,310
has solved all their problems and I

9
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,460
think we're gonna see just such a

10
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,750
massive new wave of CBD products coming

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,990
to market I think we're going to see

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,399
such a massive wave of new cultivators

13
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:29,089
coming to market especially in you know

14
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:32,699
Kentucky Tennessee North Carolina

15
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:34,200
Colorado this massive hemp farms come

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,149
out so all these people to think that

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,190
hems gonna or you know hemp derived

18
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,628
distillate nice leather against eight

19
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:41,789
thousand dollars a kilogram I think

20
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:43,019
you're sadly mistaken when they see how

21
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,420
much comes to market and how much is

22
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,500
gonna be available and I'm really

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,480
worried about all these guys have

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,280
created CBD brands recently that are

25
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,099
gonna go through you know really really

26
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,198
tough time with price compression unless

27
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,090
you have great brand equity but at this

28
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,519
point in time there's I can't think of a

29
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,350
single CBD company that really has that

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,789
much brand equity and then there's the

31
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,579
question of whether or not the FDA jumps

32
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,799
in and I think the FDA is a is certainly

33
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,510
looking a lot more closely at CBD than

34
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,890
they were previously because they're

35
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,010
thinking that everyone's jumping into it

36
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,769
now and if you make claims that don't

37
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,540
pass muster with with what they think is

38
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:20,158
acceptable expect that you're gonna get

39
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,009
a letter from the FDA at this point so

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,630
I'm really curious to see what happens

41
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,509
because everyone thinks well CBD is

42
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:29,640
legal now well well we'll say it's it's

43
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,640
legal to an extent but we'll see whether

44
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,400
or not it's legal to to sell with you no

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,739
no no additional oversight and I think

46
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,400
that oversights coming five years from

47
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:44,399
now like market size of hemp and hemp

48
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,560
derived product versus what led the

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:54,030
charge which was you know higher THC

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:56,450
cannabis yeah do you think kind of

51
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,710
industrial hemp just gonna be like an

52
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,710
800-pound gorilla compared to what

53
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,030
I think for CBD and potentially you know

54
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:07,590
surprisingly for other you know

55
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:20,460
lesser-known trace cannabinoids

56
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:27,420
yeah very likely yeah it's kind of rub

57
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:29,100
it on yours great point yeah I mean for

58
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,379
for all the hype we're getting right now

59
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,509
about hemp for for CBD I think

60
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,519
ultimately like hemp becomes a huge

61
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:38,069
industry of its own right for everything

62
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,230
else for plastics for building materials

63
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,400
as you said you know for clothing fur

64
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:43,079
you know if you think about all the

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,450
things that hemp is good for it and also

66
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,250
how quickly it grows how fast it can be

67
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:49,399
you know it doesn't it doesn't damage

68
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,500
the soil in fact it's a remediation

69
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,030
product so planting hemp makes your soil

70
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,250
better it's oftentimes planted after

71
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,930
you've depleted the soil exactly yeah

72
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,189
you know you think like Superfund sites

73
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,659
you know can you plant hemp they're

74
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,280
clean it up and still be able to use the

75
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,229
hemp for for other things outside of

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,879
human consumption there's there's so

77
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,789
many great reasons for him to become a

78
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,669
massive industry so I think that you

79
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:15,269
know the the cannabinoid side of hemp is

80
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:17,458
you know a small sliver of what I would

81
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,840
have totally idea and I think that's you

82
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,729
know it's the one thing that I think

83
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,739
we've been waiting for for a long time

84
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,229
and you think about the how hemp became

85
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,670
illegal and what a farce it was that you

86
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,750
know no one was told in Congress that

87
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:29,579
they're actually talking about hemp

88
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,989
because those called marijuana at the

89
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,670
time and that you know even people that

90
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,530
passed the bill were like wait wait a

91
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,509
second what do we just do we just mean

92
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,739
hemp illegal you know it would have been

93
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,329
a huge industry for the last hundred

94
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,219
years but for the fact that it was a

95
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,610
cloaked under you know some other name

96
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,609
that no one

97
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,758
