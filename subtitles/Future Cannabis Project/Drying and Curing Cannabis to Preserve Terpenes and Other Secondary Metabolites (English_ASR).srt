1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,060
welcome everybody I'm Adriene Giovinco

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:08,099
inspired CEO really excited to kick off

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,589
today we're really excited to share this

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,500
content with you and be part of

5
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:15,419
contributing to the collective knowledge

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,250
that's out there in the field today

7
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,948
we're going to talk about what happens

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,089
when we cut mature cannabis flowers down

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:26,340
and take the months of hard work and

10
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,740
love we put into nurturing these plants

11
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,379
into finished product full of the

12
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:34,409
compounds patients need and consumers

13
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,009
want the compounds I'm talking about are

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:39,479
cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids

15
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:42,988
collectively referred to as secondary

16
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,750
metabolites these compounds often serve

17
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:47,669
as defense mechanisms by the plant but

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,649
have been bred over centuries to bring

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,379
out unique characteristics that humans

20
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,948
find useful for medicines flavorings and

21
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:58,339
recreational drugs all of the parameters

22
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:00,539
that are at play when the plan is

23
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,390
photosynthesizing are still at play in

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,640
the curing stage as we learn about more

25
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,590
later curing cannabis is all about

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,769
strategically managing these parameters

27
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,150
to get the very best cannabis to market

28
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:14,340
there are common practices taught by

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,490
generations of successful cultivators

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,868
that are widely used at scale to work

31
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:20,819
but as science makes its mark on the

32
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:22,859
industry are there lessons to learn

33
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,048
are there more efficient less

34
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:26,969
labor-intensive ways to dry and cure the

35
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,140
that allow us to capture more of this

36
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:32,640
valuable secondary metabolites our

37
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,009
exploration has opened up questions at

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,219
the same time it's provided answers and

39
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,140
we're excited to take a closer look the

40
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,319
pilots of today's presentation are

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,420
inspired CTO Robby bass and inspires

42
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:49,648
cannabis business strategist Jesse

43
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,478
Porter so what is curing cannabis it's

44
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,000
the process that controls against

45
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,399
product loss and degradation add value

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and brand recognition but it's so much

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,549
more it's an art it's a science it's an

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,399
expression a signature and a sign of

49
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,380
quality the end user wants a product

50
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,419
that smokes clean tastes great and

51
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,180
reflects the potency and effects of the

52
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,809
genetics the craft cultivator wants a

53
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,670
product that reflects all the

54
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,150
passion and hard work that went into

55
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:21,568
cultivating the genetics we see hearing

56
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,010
as a choke point and an opportunity

57
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,719
controlling the curing process creates

58
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:29,530
consistent results in predictable

59
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:31,209
product flow but we always wonder you

60
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,750
know how much product you lost are in

61
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:36,360
caring the temperature degradation

62
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,610
handling the blood rot to light exposure

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,850
could you put a number on it it can have

64
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,069
a significant financial impact and it's

65
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:47,530
an aspect of cannabis production often

66
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:49,509
overlooked mismanaged or misunderstood

67
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,390
by entrepreneurs and cultivators of

68
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:53,889
light appropriate caring will increase

69
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:56,319
your price per pound and extraction

70
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:58,409
yields it will reduce the amount of

71
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,989
product loss to bud rot and pathogens

72
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:04,180
curing will increase shelf life and

73
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:07,780
importantly hearing cannabis is better

74
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,760
medicine the desired effects potency and

75
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,500
flavor all directly tied to the

76
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,620
secondary metabolites produced during

77
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,719
that flowering phase these flavonoids

78
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,120
terpenes and cannabinoids combine to

79
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,939
create the true entourage effects that

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,340
make you love a strain and in order to

81
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:26,259
protect those secondary metabolites it's

82
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,329
important to understand the science of

83
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:32,229
what is happening when we care cannabis

84
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:33,849
and I'll be honest we're all trying to

85
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:36,099
understand the science behind caring

86
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:38,560
cannabis and we admit the research on

87
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:41,109
the topic is lacking we've spoken with

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,170
molecular biologist atmospheric

89
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,840
physicists chemists research scientists

90
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:49,569
cannabis cup winners I even talked to

91
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,579
some guy with a particle accelerator we

92
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,829
talked to cheese makers dry aged meat

93
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:56,319
producers wine makers and Colin E or

94
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:58,000
herb manufacturers we pulled out it from

95
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,489
licensed cannabis producers around the

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,400
u.s. we're doing our own research as we

97
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:04,959
speak there are still some unknowns some

98
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,269
variables that need to be controlled and

99
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,890
some tests that need to be done we've

100
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,510
collected some useful data that we'd

101
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:13,509
like to contribute to the discussion on

102
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:15,250
caring what we do know is that cured

103
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:16,988
cannabis is more desirable and

104
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,089
understanding the process will increase

105
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:21,418
yield and produce cannabis cup winning

106
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:21,418
results

107
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:28,639
so what's the difference between drying

108
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:31,949
and caring we get this question a lot I

109
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,529
usually say you can dry in the oven but

110
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:36,750
you cure with care and what I mean by

111
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:38,869
that is trying is part of the curing

112
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,699
story but it's not the whole story

113
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,500
drying cannabis is about removing enough

114
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,319
moisture so the product can be smoked or

115
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,240
otherwise processed I mean throw it in

116
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,399
the oven at 200 degrees for an hour and

117
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,930
it'll be dry but it won't be enjoyable

118
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,000
curing cannabis is a controlled process

119
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,189
that protects secondary metabolites

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,339
furthers chemo type expression and

121
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:04,019
creates an enjoyable smoke carrying

122
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,459
cannabis accounts for the time and

123
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:11,339
conditions required to maximize

124
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:12,930
expression and preserve the product and

125
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,519
when it comes to talking about the best

126
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,900
product it's important to know when to

127
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,750
harvest to get the most out of your

128
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:21,089
efforts this part of the process does

129
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,769
have some art involved as trichomes

130
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:25,319
develop they go through three distinct

131
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:26,909
phases and after the plant is harvested

132
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,790
that development continues for a short

133
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,740
period of time the trichomes develop a

134
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,980
stem and a head that I sort of think

135
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,740
result resembles a mushroom begins clear

136
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,890
and the head swells matures and becomes

137
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,170
cloudy cloudy trichomes are at the peak

138
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:45,839
of ripeness and the goal is the harvest

139
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,090
as many of them as possible when the

140
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:54,089
trichomes begin to degrade they turn

141
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:55,589
amber and signal an eminent harvest so

142
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:59,250
what's the tricolor and what's in it

143
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:02,609
well here's a drawing of one it has

144
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:06,839
around 30 flavonoids 200 terpenes and

145
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:09,990
140 cannabinoids give or take a few and

146
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,729
we don't want to lose any at all this

147
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,590
mushroom had we developed in flour

148
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,319
contains the majority of the good stuff

149
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:18,419
the secretory cells have the terpenes

150
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,509
and the secretory vesicles have the

151
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,310
cannabinoids we want to make sure that

152
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:25,730
they are fully developed and protected

153
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,110
through the entire packaging pipeline

154
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:31,680
once harvested the plant stops

155
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:34,439
transpiring begins rest firing and needs

156
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,670
to be managed to protect the product the

157
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,350
handling of the product

158
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,689
must be done with care in order to make

159
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:44,490
sure delicate trichomes heads are not

160
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:47,100
destroyed and that brings us the factors

161
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,870
of degradation handling is a factor of

162
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,480
degradation but as Brian mentioned

163
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:54,660
earlier all ten cardinal parameters of

164
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,870
plant influence impact hearing light

165
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,650
humidity temperature co2 airflow and

166
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:04,579
atmospheric conditions water oxygen

167
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:07,079
microbes nutrients they're all at play

168
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:09,180
understanding how each influence is each

169
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,099
other and the cannabis product during

170
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,389
shearing is an important step in the

171
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,390
refinement of the process

172
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,560
first let's talk about temperature as it

173
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,199
drives the time line associated with

174
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,079
moisture removal a hotter than ambient

175
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,580
temperature the faster the product dries

176
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,948
we know that if we draw a product too

177
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:33,158
quickly however the result will crumble

178
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,930
to a powder and lack appeal one reason

179
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:37,329
for this is that the temperatures above

180
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,009
68 degrees Fahrenheit can volatize

181
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:42,490
terpenes and degrade secondary

182
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,288
metabolites temperature will also impact

183
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,749
the speed and completion of enzymatic

184
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:49,028
reactions within the plant so raising

185
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:51,819
temperatures 10 degrees will double the

186
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:53,889
speed of enzymatic reactions but when

187
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:57,039
temperatures are too cold enzymatic

188
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:59,408
reactions hole in order to uniformly

189
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,378
cure cannabis temperatures should be

190
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:05,079
consistent and below 68 degrees at all

191
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:08,020
times to drive enzymes and protect

192
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:10,598
secondary metabolites and while low

193
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:12,568
temps slow passage and development it

194
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:16,240
can also cause discoloration and

195
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:18,729
susceptibility to decay mperatures and

196
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:24,129
time are a balancing act when we think

197
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:26,740
about curing lights also a major factor

198
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:28,479
in caring we know that if light is

199
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,788
present plants will continue to produce

200
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,879
chlorophyll which is unwanted for the

201
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:37,389
next phase but light also negatively

202
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:39,908
affects oils visible light triggers the

203
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:43,240
auto oxidation process and UV light

204
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:45,909
causes photo oxidation both of which

205
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,669
degrade oils especially those

206
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:50,948
monoterpenes monoterpenes have been

207
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:53,439
shown degrade rapidly under the presence

208
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:56,379
of light and high temperatures like in a

209
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,360
matter of hours so I think this is one

210
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:01,000
area where fresh frozen processing is

211
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,769
fantastic it allows for the capture of

212
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,990
more monoterpenes that what other buyers

213
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:09,909
deloft in the curing process moving

214
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,879
forward another major influence on the

215
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:14,708
curing process is humidity humidity is

216
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,769
about the moisture in the room as well

217
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:20,409
as in the bud and we know buzzer between

218
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:22,480
80 to 95 percent water weight at harvest

219
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:25,659
and most of that moisture needs to be

220
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,220
removed so one core concept of caring is

221
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:29,169
that we migrate the moisture from the

222
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,950
interior of the bud to the exterior

223
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:34,120
and while high moisture content

224
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,730
facilitates passage and growth in bud

225
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,480
rod studies have shown that reducing

226
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,860
moisture content of the bud below 20%

227
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,320
prevents microbe growth and increases

228
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,539
shelf life the slow and controlled

229
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,209
progression of moisture facilitates

230
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:50,948
chemical enzymatic reactions and allows

231
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:53,799
the water to pull more unwanted

232
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:55,629
materials from the plant but slow

233
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:58,240
controlled moisture removal requires

234
00:09:55,629 --> 00:10:00,789
more than just some fans it takes an

235
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,149
understanding of pressures engineering

236
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:07,208
and controlled measurement and speaking

237
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:09,009
about controlled measurement we need to

238
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:13,479
reduce the moisture content of the bud

239
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:15,939
below 20% but precision is important the

240
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,449
difference between 19% moisture in the

241
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:23,620
bud and 14% moisture in the bud is well

242
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:25,929
5% right but that 5% of water weight

243
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:30,549
could easily be worth millions of

244
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:35,799
dollars at scale millions take some time

245
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:38,078
to digest that in about time when it

246
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:40,000
comes to curing time there's a balancing

247
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,088
act between terpenes loss and the

248
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,429
completion of the enzymatic processes

249
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:48,000
when it comes to terpenes time is the

250
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:51,549
enemy as they get grade every single day

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,289
for enzymes time is a friend who allows

252
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:57,039
for the completion of the enzymatic

253
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:58,990
processes with limited time enzymes to a

254
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,389
limited job in the breakdown of starches

255
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,600
in chlorophyll leaving the final product

256
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:06,759
harsh and tasting like alfalfa take you

257
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,730
long and risk the exposure to microbial

258
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:12,220
outbreaks breakdown and degradation of

259
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,970
secondary metabolites which will destroy

260
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,980
bag appeal it takes a delicate touch to

261
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,528
balance terpene loss and enzymatic

262
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,370
processes needed to make for a superior

263
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:23,370
consumable

264
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,190
atmospheric conditions like gases in the

265
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,460
room will influence the curing process

266
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:36,220
as well one effective atmospheric

267
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,170
conditions is oil oxidation which

268
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,629
accelerates with the concentration of

269
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:42,309
dissolved oxygen and depends Laurel

270
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:44,620
Affiliate largely on the oxygen

271
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:47,769
pressures in the headspace as well as

272
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,480
the ambient temperatures oil oxidation

273
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:52,149
is an undesirable series of chemical

274
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:56,050
reactions involved involving oxygen that

275
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:58,529
degrades the quality of oil oxidation

276
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:02,109
eventually produces rancidity in oil and

277
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:04,539
acrimonious flavors and smells and while

278
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,039
all oil is in a state of oxidation you

279
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:09,490
can't stop it completely

280
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:13,539
there are ways to reduce it modified

281
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:15,850
atmospheric packaging m80 map is a

282
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:17,799
useful system which makes it possible to

283
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,080
regulate the composition of atmosphere

284
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,839
in the headspace and thus control the

285
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,150
rate of respiration respiration is one

286
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,190
of the basic processes of deterioration

287
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:30,459
and it's highly influenced by the

288
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:34,390
atmospheric composition of co2 oxygen

289
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:38,230
ethylene and water vapor driven by

290
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:41,620
temperature during respiration oxygen is

291
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:44,920
consumed and co2 ethylene and water

292
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,049
vapor generated map allows you to

293
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:49,929
control atmospheric conditions that

294
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:52,659
impact hearing so you can slow down or

295
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:55,719
speed up respiration and other metabolic

296
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:58,539
processes this also allows you to reduce

297
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,850
sensitivity to ethylene reduce the

298
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:04,149
development of disorders and inhibit

299
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:06,250
pathogen development air exchanges in

300
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:07,990
the space and the control of atmospheric

301
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,450
conditions are imperative for the

302
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,299
control of the curing process however

303
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:16,060
it's important to note we need enough

304
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:18,309
oxygen long enough to trigger those

305
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:21,099
reactions but we need to limit dwell

306
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:25,049
time in order to protect the oils map

307
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,050
allows us to control these variables

308
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:33,159
so what in the plant makes it harsh

309
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:37,789
chlorophylls lipids sugars carbohydrates

310
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:40,969
amino acids water fertilizers and heavy

311
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:42,860
metals can all make the smoke harsh when

312
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,290
we're caring we're essentially trying to

313
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:48,620
remove or otherwise process out as much

314
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:50,599
of that other stuff as possible our

315
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,990
plants work hard to create this biomass

316
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,209
and flower enzymes work hard to remove

317
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,589
it afterwards

318
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:59,268
plants create chlorophyll which give the

319
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:02,240
plant its green color and undesirable

320
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:04,220
grassy flavor fats and sugars are also

321
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,829
created during the growth process and

322
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,379
become energy sources for the reactions

323
00:14:06,828 --> 00:14:11,179
as the plant drives and cures but

324
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:13,338
excessive nitrogen and heavy metals and

325
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:15,649
the fertilizers can also impact curing

326
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:19,160
and cause Auto oxidation and long term

327
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:21,740
storage so proper plant nutrition during

328
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:24,318
flower and appropriate cultivation

329
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,198
techniques lead to better cured product

330
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:32,269
that is less susceptible to

331
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:34,458
deterioration something that makes the

332
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:37,339
cured product less harsh is respiration

333
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:39,318
that we mentioned earlier respirations

334
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:42,260
the process in which organisms convert

335
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:43,490
biochemical energy from stored food like

336
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:46,159
the sugars and starches from

337
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:50,600
photosynthesis into adenosine

338
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:53,028
triphosphate or ATP for ripening during

339
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,670
respiration plants take oxygen from the

340
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:58,129
air and give off carbon dioxide moisture

341
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:00,919
and heat the opposite of photosynthesis

342
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:02,929
and respiration continues until the

343
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:06,198
stored starch and sugar reserves are

344
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:08,629
depleted temperature dictates the speed

345
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:11,149
of respiration and is the most important

346
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:14,360
factor in influencing post-harvest life

347
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:16,220
and quality of a given product the

348
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,350
oxygen in the surrounding environment is

349
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,439
above most importance because it's the

350
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,209
primary gas to use during respiration

351
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:26,269
the lowering oxygen in the air allows

352
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:28,518
you to lower the respiration rate but if

353
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:30,679
there's not enough oxygen the product

354
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,568
goes into anaerobic fermentation and

355
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:36,609
will produce alcohols that

356
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:36,610
impart unwanted flavors

357
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,669
enzymes also play a role in respiration

358
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:46,120
and there are four enzyme groups

359
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:50,299
facilitating the curing process

360
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:53,029
proteases amylases lip Hayes's and

361
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:56,209
cellulases and they all break down

362
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:58,370
different stuff these enzymes use stored

363
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:01,550
plant energy to break down unwanted

364
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:06,259
plant materials like proteins nucleic

365
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:08,750
acids starches fats phosphate esters and

366
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:12,139
other macro molecular substances during

367
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:15,230
the cheering process I temperature

368
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:17,689
drives enzymatic reactions and affords

369
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,460
protections against microbial growth but

370
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,790
high temperatures will also negatively

371
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,900
affect secondary metabolites

372
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:27,079
temperatures that are too high or too

373
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:30,980
low will denature enzymatic activity and

374
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:34,190
that cannot be restarted these enzymes

375
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:37,250
need plant material heat proper pH and

376
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:40,490
moisture to activate and they need time

377
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:43,070
to work but their process creates longer

378
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:50,779
chain molecules that have unique flavor

379
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:53,120
and amplified effects in the case of

380
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:56,029
water in the case of curing waters both

381
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,460
a preservative an assault it plays a

382
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:00,740
critical role as a catalyst enzymes and

383
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:04,789
is a vehicle for removing unwanted

384
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,529
products from the bud hydrolysis is a

385
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:08,680
chemical reaction in which the

386
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:11,119
interaction of a compound with water

387
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:14,150
results in the decomposition of that

388
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,849
compound this process breaks down

389
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,160
chemical polymers into simpler units and

390
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:22,399
an example of that is turning starches

391
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,650
into sugars hydrolysis is one of the

392
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,009
most important processes that improve

393
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,420
the quality of cannabis as it cures as

394
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:31,700
water migrates out of the plant

395
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,950
it will remove byproducts from the

396
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,170
breakdown caused by enzymatic activity

397
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:39,250
and further the development of secondary

398
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,720
metabolites if water moves too quickly

399
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,640
there will not be enough time to

400
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,059
effectively compete complete the

401
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,120
processes if the process is too slow

402
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,730
you risk mold and other biological

403
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:54,209
contamination

404
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,920
water activity drives microbial activity

405
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,000
and that's why we need to remove it for

406
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,400
long-term storage

407
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,930
but in controlling water migration

408
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,180
through the plant we allow it to

409
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:07,430
modernize development stimulate

410
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,430
processes and produce a cleaner smoke

411
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:14,460
thinking about post-harvest diseases

412
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:17,069
curing and stored products are subject

413
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,519
to a variety of rots and decay caused by

414
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:22,169
fungi and bacteria unknown fungi that

415
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,930
can develop an occuring phase or

416
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:28,259
botrytis and Kazarian and some of the

417
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:30,120
bacteria sued ammonia and astralis these

418
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:32,910
diseases can cause color change

419
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:36,689
degradation and will certainly result in

420
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:38,519
a failed microbial test it's important

421
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,980
to note that many infections of diseases

422
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,690
start before harvest and when these

423
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,049
products are transferred to storage

424
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:48,840
infections continue to develop so proper

425
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:52,139
environmental controls product handling

426
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:54,959
and SOPs are required to prevent post

427
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,759
harvest diseases the caring space should

428
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,130
have appropriate biological filtration

429
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:02,539
in place to prevent contamination and

430
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:04,980
the growth of yeast bacteria and molds

431
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:07,829
sanitation biological filtration are

432
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,630
also important to handlers to protect

433
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:13,829
products from post harvest diseases

434
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:16,770
people carry pests we have about 10,000

435
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:19,379
microbes on each hand and we lose 40,000

436
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:21,299
skin cells every minute these are things

437
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,080
to consider in order to protect the

438
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,079
final product

439
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:32,130
what makes cannabis great turns out time

440
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:35,089
is a factor in chemo type expression the

441
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,530
process of polymerization is magical

442
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:39,750
studies show us that when cannabis is

443
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:43,109
cured over time we do not see an

444
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:45,539
increase in the quantity of terpenes we

445
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:49,409
see a measurable difference in terpene

446
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:52,500
profile terpenes marry commingle and

447
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:54,779
continue to develop and homogenize the

448
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,109
polymerization process takes sort of

449
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:59,700
fantastic individual terpenes and

450
00:19:57,109 --> 00:20:02,099
harmonizes them in a way specific to the

451
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,940
genetics and ball it's like going from

452
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:07,730
mono to stereo and flavor and effects so

453
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,529
we know that during the curing phase

454
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,450
secondary metabolites reconnect to

455
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:15,539
create new compounds not present at

456
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:18,230
harvest this is when the product becomes

457
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:20,879
unique and stands out in the market I

458
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:24,630
think this is also a very important

459
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,730
aspect of medical viability as well when

460
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,830
my mom was sick with cancer we tried

461
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,509
every strain we could find and the

462
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:34,129
results were inconsistent

463
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:37,048
I think the curing was inconsistent to

464
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,940
when cured correctly the terpene

465
00:20:37,048 --> 00:20:41,730
cannabinoid expression has fully

466
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:45,150
developed and is more capable than the

467
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:48,058
individual metabolites cured cannabis is

468
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,850
better medicine curing creates a better

469
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:53,668
recreational product - but better yet

470
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:56,369
polymerization allows for the true team

471
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,720
of our expression of strains if we

472
00:20:56,369 --> 00:21:00,509
really want to know the medical

473
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,370
viability of each genetic we need to

474
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,740
make sure that we cure it appropriately

475
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:07,168
in order to capture the symphony of

476
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:13,349
polymerized secondary metabolites and

477
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:16,400
not just a few standout notes so how do

478
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:18,480
we consistently achieve great results

479
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,519
understanding the factors we just talked

480
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,079
about there are a variety of coaches

481
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:26,308
that we have seen have success in the

482
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:28,889
market first is the legacy birth this

483
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:32,279
classic process has been refined for

484
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,210
generations it has a rich history of

485
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:36,879
success

486
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,700
the core concept here is to harvest the

487
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,430
plant remove the fan leaves hang it

488
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,660
upside down blast it with air until it's

489
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,509
crispy to the touch

490
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:51,250
then bucket put it in an airtight

491
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:54,460
container burp it and monitor it many

492
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:56,710
iterations of this method exist everyone

493
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,319
has a different opinion on how long and

494
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:04,809
how often to birth and even how long did

495
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:09,250
you err is it 7 days 14 days 30 days 6

496
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:12,639
months depends on who you ask what we do

497
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:16,509
know is that this system works but we

498
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,280
don't fully understand why even at the

499
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:19,960
highest level of academia they're

500
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:21,460
studying this legacy method to better

501
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,759
understand the science behind the

502
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:27,279
results understanding what happens to

503
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,529
these buds scientifically while they're

504
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,690
in this airtight environment should

505
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:37,960
prove to be a very strong breakthrough

506
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:39,850
in curing cannabis science another

507
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,640
method we've explored is freeze drawing

508
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:45,309
and I'll admit at first I thought it was

509
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,950
a gimmick but then I experienced the

510
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:52,149
nose and bag appeal of products that had

511
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:54,580
been freeze-dried uname important to

512
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,470
note that this level of freeze-dried

513
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:59,949
carrying is not something you do with a

514
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:02,890
harvest right survival freeze dryer it's

515
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,319
a precision machine built and operated

516
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,720
by professionals oversight and

517
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:10,029
understanding is needed but the core

518
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,460
concept here is that we vacuum purge the

519
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:14,680
water from the product remove the water

520
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,590
from the chamber then freeze dry the

521
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:20,860
product freeze dry is one of the best

522
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:24,599
ways to halt the degradation process to

523
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:26,909
protect THC in the secondary metabolites

524
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:29,679
however this process does require

525
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:32,019
delicate hands to not damage the product

526
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,120
and a fundamental understanding of

527
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:37,539
timelines to make sure that appropriate

528
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:39,399
enzymatic activities can occur we are

529
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:41,289
all excited to follow the evolution of

530
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,790
this technology and see where it leads

531
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:47,889
us speaking of technology I'll let our

532
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:49,720
CTO take it from here and talk about

533
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:52,330
how we've been refining the process of

534
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,539
drawing and curing in the same room rob

535
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:59,019
thicke thanks Jesse

536
00:23:54,539 --> 00:24:01,269
you got everyone over I'd inspire we

537
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:04,240
delved into providing these environments

538
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:06,369
control systems for drying and curing we

539
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,750
went to the best we went to the worst

540
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:09,489
and we look at all the different parts

541
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,349
of between and we came to the

542
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,390
realization that the most specialized

543
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,769
and effective combined drying and curing

544
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,500
chambers on the market have the

545
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:19,089
following features they can accurately

546
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,980
control temperature and humidity in a

547
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:23,679
wide range and they can have a

548
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,420
substantially high airflow rate relative

549
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,980
even to the cultivation rooms we were

550
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,920
designing at around 20 to 30

551
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,900
interchanges per hour but we were still

552
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,490
being asked to design a large-scale

553
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,490
drying room in one part of the facility

554
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,930
in a curing room in the other and this

555
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,490
naturally led us to wonder what's the

556
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,380
point of drying in one room and then

557
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:44,019
curing in another specialized device

558
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,810
being a jar a Tupperware container or a

559
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:49,349
card bare cardboard barrel why can't we

560
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:51,700
try and cure cannabis in the same space

561
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:53,709
now this might end up being one of those

562
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,900
game-changer ideas that flies in the

563
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,370
face of conventional wisdom jesse was

564
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,680
just describing that conventional

565
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:01,000
technique earlier the drying step and

566
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,310
the curing step it happened in two

567
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,740
different rooms well this is a

568
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:07,659
tried-and-true approach it brings with

569
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,509
it this extra incurred cost of labor

570
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:13,450
equipment and real estate and also you

571
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:15,900
have a risk of damaging the product in

572
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:18,130
the transfer from one spot to the other

573
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,019
you know why take up two different areas

574
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,910
in a facility anyways for drying and

575
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,670
then curing if instead it could be done

576
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,410
quickly and in the same space why not

577
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,789
use that freed up floor area for like

578
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:30,970
bigger and better things I don't know we

579
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:33,039
don't drilling more plants so if you

580
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,860
want to design a dry cure room and

581
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,240
handle this in one fell swoop let's talk

582
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:39,639
about some of the ideas that might serve

583
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,079
you well the first place to start is

584
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,480
with confidence that you've got

585
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:45,789
consistent airflow around the product in

586
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,740
the room you're trying to cure we

587
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:49,599
consider this to be a task for the CFD

588
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,250
modeling software we employ and it's a

589
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,949
good way for us to provide a strong

590
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,289
validation to our curing room physical

591
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,360
layout suggestions you're also going to

592
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:59,889
want to have a strategy for moisture

593
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:01,029
removal over time you want to

594
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,910
understand whether it's going to be a

595
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:05,920
tenday linear drying rate with the same

596
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,380
amount of moisture remove each and every

597
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,730
day or some other strategy but this is

598
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:16,750
going to form the basis for your

599
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:18,759
equipment selections now if you want to

600
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,930
take it to the next level you'll want to

601
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:21,549
start talking about what those actual

602
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,410
set points in the room are going to be

603
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:25,509
you'll probably want to target a

604
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:28,150
specific temperature for product quality

605
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:29,890
maintenance and a humidity level that

606
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,220
allows you to realize the strategy you

607
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,810
came up with on the previous slide to

608
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,509
maintain the balance of that highest

609
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:38,740
level of terpene retention our

610
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:40,990
reasonable curing and polymerization

611
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,299
rate and a satisfactory level of

612
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,740
enzymatic activity then that temperature

613
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:48,430
is probably gonna be around 65 degrees

614
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:53,289
Fahrenheit and humidity anywhere from 50

615
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:55,120
to 65% now the most advanced way to

616
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:57,670
approach this task is to automate the

617
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,439
whole thing it is possible the field

618
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:02,080
feedback moisture removal from the

619
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,120
product back into your humidity control

620
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,919
scheme so we've seen a number of systems

621
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:07,389
do this but the most accurate way seems

622
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,330
to be tracking the weight of the product

623
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:12,160
through time in the curing room and the

624
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:15,490
best data we have tells us that the rate

625
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,810
of moisture removal changes over time at

626
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,500
a given temperature and humidity

627
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:22,359
setpoint in the space but if instead of

628
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,799
fixing your temperature and humidity

629
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:26,649
let's say we just fixed the temperature

630
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:28,899
we could manipulate the space humidity

631
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,970
to change the vapor pressure on the

632
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:33,280
moisture content of the plants and this

633
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,720
directly controls the rate of drying now

634
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,769
again

635
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,710
manipulating the room vapor levels

636
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:40,750
controls the moisture removal and gives

637
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,610
you the ability to slow down or increase

638
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,339
moisture loss over time allowing some

639
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:48,849
polymerization and curing to happen at

640
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:50,319
the same time as the drying step this is

641
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:52,269
the best way to achieve a hands-off

642
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:54,189
approach to the curing process and also

643
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:57,129
deliver consistency through benchmarking

644
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:59,019
from batch to batch we don't expect

645
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,420
curing strategies to be fixed over time

646
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:02,980
and neither should you even the

647
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,960
differences in bud structure of

648
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,880
different crop genetics will be

649
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,740
influential in determining a signature

650
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,110
curing methodology that you can attach

651
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,048
to your product flexibility in the

652
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:16,548
conditions you can maintain might be

653
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:18,898
even more important in this regard so

654
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:21,960
how did you get into the actual InDesign

655
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:23,878
keep the following ideas in mind first

656
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,100
if you're going to turn your room into a

657
00:28:23,878 --> 00:28:27,480
big cheering jar you really need to

658
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:30,058
think about sealing your room

659
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,499
tight construction and filled concrete

660
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:33,480
floors are some of those considerations

661
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:35,009
this is going to prevent gases from

662
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,710
getting into and out of the room we love

663
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:39,269
your control to that end you'll probably

664
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,249
want to break the seal every once in a

665
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:43,019
while you should consider a mechanism to

666
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:45,298
ventilate or burp the room just like you

667
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:47,009
wouldn't a jar to do this effectively

668
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:49,079
you'll need a way to bring atmospheric

669
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:51,389
air into this space to delete the

670
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:52,949
build-up of gases and be sure you've got

671
00:28:51,388 --> 00:28:56,008
at least Merv 15 filters on this

672
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,149
mechanism on the room exhaust be a good

673
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,889
neighbor and consider an odor

674
00:28:57,148 --> 00:29:01,498
remediation systems that you're not

675
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:02,969
exhausting air that other people in the

676
00:29:01,499 --> 00:29:05,210
neighborhood might find offensive when

677
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,308
you release it into the atmosphere

678
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:10,079
lastly consider a sensor array for

679
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:11,749
determining when and how often you'd

680
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,548
like to ventilate or burp the room

681
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:17,608
sensing systems for ethylene are readily

682
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:19,499
available as well as for co2 as we heard

683
00:29:17,608 --> 00:29:21,538
from Jessi these gases provide real

684
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:23,940
indications of the stage of curing

685
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:26,368
you've achieved monitoring them will

686
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,929
help you hone your caring strategy and

687
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:29,759
in the future I think we'll see

688
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:31,889
electronic monitoring of other specific

689
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,899
gases I mean she's got a system flexible

690
00:29:31,888 --> 00:29:36,868
enough to incorporate what might be

691
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:38,398
coming by way of example we're finding

692
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:40,470
out that the pathogens we're trying to

693
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,329
avoid in the rooms actually generate

694
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:44,460
gases that usually can't be detected by

695
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:47,158
humans with a background of all the

696
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:50,009
other smells that are in there currently

697
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,899
claro ana soles and styles are compounds

698
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:53,819
of interest and we're as curious as you

699
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:55,888
are to see what ours and others research

700
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:58,579
leads us to in the study of the gas

701
00:29:55,888 --> 00:30:01,528
sensing arena hey Jeff you there

702
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:04,378
absolutely Rob great job I was buddy

703
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:07,499
back to you to wrap up this puppy you

704
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:09,599
know and that sort of brings us to the

705
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:11,548
end of our presentation I wanted to take

706
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,778
a moment to say that I really think

707
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:15,118
we're all in this together

708
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:16,950
sharing knowledge and going down the

709
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:19,709
path of education is only going to

710
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:22,169
improve the curing process but even when

711
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,538
we have enough data to talk objectively

712
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:26,520
there's going to be an artistic touch

713
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:28,500
that sets many people apart

714
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,990
a signature that's a byproduct of

715
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,250
experience and fuel and we just hope

716
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,779
that this webinar gives you some

717
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,720
information need to refine your

718
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:38,460
signature and paint your masterpiece so

719
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,110
thanks again for joining us today please

720
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,819
give us a few minutes to organize the

721
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:44,099
questions from the audience and for me

722
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:46,889
to get a few sips of tea and then we'll

723
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:51,349
jump into the Q&amp;A here the first

724
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:56,340
question is can you achieve

725
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:59,309
decarboxylation through curing and it

726
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:02,269
may it may be worthwhile to quickly

727
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:03,539
explain what the decarboxylation means

728
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:06,599
sure

729
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:09,299
so decarboxylation is essentially the

730
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:13,439
process that cannabis goes through to

731
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:16,319
become psychoactive traditionally we

732
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,049
associate that with heat a certain heat

733
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:21,210
requirement that changes the polymers

734
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:23,879
that allows them to be more psychoactive

735
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:26,789
so that product thing can be used

736
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,440
directly to manufacture edibles or even

737
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:30,750
consume directly to still get the

738
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,220
effects whereas fresh bud that's not be

739
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,519
carboxylated won't get you that

740
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,170
psychoactive effects I think an

741
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,660
interesting note here is something we're

742
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:43,200
still discovering Allison justice and

743
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:46,140
outcode did a study on curing hemp and

744
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,980
cannabis and what they found was that in

745
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,830
over the process of a 30-day cure right

746
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,720
around day 30 they actually achieved

747
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:57,389
decarboxylation which is a dramatic

748
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,100
breakthrough because that's not

749
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,690
something that's been proven to be

750
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:04,409
achieved through the curing process in

751
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:06,480
the past I wonder what the elements

752
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,920
involved are you know it's important to

753
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,200
understand the parameters and the

754
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,110
conditions the heat that was in fact in

755
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,900
impacting that that shared isolated

756
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:18,659
space but also the pressures and the

757
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,519
gases there are a lot of things going on

758
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:24,210
in that airtight space that could

759
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:27,569
actually contribute to decarboxylation

760
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:29,009
I think pH is another one too but anyway

761
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:30,299
there's a handful of things in there

762
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:32,129
that could they could affect

763
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:33,720
decarboxylation actually make it happen

764
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:35,040
and now it's been proven on paper so I

765
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,740
think it's something we need to explore

766
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,720
more but it's an interesting note that

767
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:43,409
we've actually seen through a study

768
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:46,620
it can be done I love it

769
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:51,299
to terpene rich psychoactive raw

770
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:56,329
cannabis some new to chew on I could be

771
00:32:51,298 --> 00:33:02,759
pretty cool all right

772
00:32:56,329 --> 00:33:05,189
no pun it one application for ya another

773
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:09,679
question coming in here at what point is

774
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,679
it no longer considered drawing securing

775
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:17,449
sure for me you know drawing is a

776
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,400
fundamental aspect of the curing process

777
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:22,470
but when you harvest the product you

778
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,330
immediately make a decision on whether

779
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,210
or not you're going to dry it or cure it

780
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:29,250
what I mean by that is that drying is a

781
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:31,679
route where you just try and add heat to

782
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,259
remove moisture and that's only one

783
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,788
small component of the curing process

784
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:39,470
that must account for all the other

785
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:42,599
things that are happening so you can try

786
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:45,538
without curing but you cannot cure

787
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:47,939
without drawing if that makes sense

788
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:49,798
that's sort of my perspective on it I

789
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,279
know we have some differential opinions

790
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:56,129
there but my feeling is that appropriate

791
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,009
curing will involve drawing where as you

792
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:01,950
can dry any way shape or form and the

793
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:04,650
curing process starts immediately upon

794
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:06,960
harvest it's the decisions you make from

795
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:09,539
that point moving forward that allow for

796
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,619
this game progression and polymerization

797
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:16,409
to have so you know the conversation is

798
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:20,250
just in hi I have on this or long and I

799
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:22,470
usually go right into the night I'm

800
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,349
convinced that you know the drying jet

801
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:27,178
through Jesse's persuasion I'm convinced

802
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:31,289
that the drying and curing can happen in

803
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:33,389
one short period of time traditionally

804
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:35,969
we see all sorts of things being asked

805
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:37,769
of us design a drying room here we're

806
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:39,809
gonna leave it in there for 10 days and

807
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:42,570
then we're going to design a curing room

808
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:43,889
over here put the things into jars or

809
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,960
whatever containers and move it into a

810
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:48,539
curing room in its own conditions and

811
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,480
let it cure in that in that area that's

812
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:53,398
usually also a seven to ten day process

813
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,048
and then it goes into bags and we see

814
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,778
the continuation of caring when we've

815
00:34:55,048 --> 00:35:02,248
got map systems involved in the storage

816
00:34:57,778 --> 00:35:03,509
of the product over time like I said

817
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:05,068
Jesse's convinced Utley we can do

818
00:35:03,509 --> 00:35:07,498
otherwise and we've started to see the

819
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:10,889
data come back that yes you can do

820
00:35:07,498 --> 00:35:14,969
drying and curing and polymerization

821
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:17,909
control caring control this can all be

822
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:19,498
done in one area but in the room that

823
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,730
you're doing it in you have to be able

824
00:35:19,498 --> 00:35:23,159
to control different levels of gases

825
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:26,969
whether it's the water content of the

826
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:28,288
air whether it's the content of ethylene

827
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:30,328
in the air whether it's the content of

828
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:32,220
co2 in the air you have to be able to

829
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,720
independently control some of those

830
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:35,518
there they both know becomes a challenge

831
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:37,618
especially at scale in a large room

832
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:39,298
we're looking at those designs right now

833
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:41,130
we're doing our own tests and I can't

834
00:35:39,298 --> 00:35:42,690
wait for part two of this webinar we can

835
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:47,849
come out and kind of reveal some of the

836
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:52,858
data that we've got oh when do you know

837
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:53,480
cheering is finished this another great

838
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:56,788
question

839
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:00,568
yeah I mean I think there's a subjective

840
00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:02,130
aspect of interpreting that product if

841
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:05,308
you like to sort of listen to that new

842
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,480
book by max Montrose and his ethos on

843
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:08,460
how you determine whether or not

844
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,079
cannabis is good or bad or the level of

845
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,880
it I think there's some interesting

846
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,009
touch points in there that really give

847
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,869
us an idea on how we judge cannabis but

848
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:18,449
let's be honest there's two factors

849
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:20,338
right there's the test results and then

850
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:22,199
there's the customer experience and sell

851
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:25,528
through numbers and both of those things

852
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,328
sort of need to line up and and justify

853
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:29,068
that higher price point that's how we

854
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:30,298
tie it back to oh yeah we're going to

855
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:31,739
get those numbers and we're going to

856
00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:33,210
achieve cleaner smoke and we're going to

857
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:36,059
get better self your numbers and better

858
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,759
brand recognition through caring it's

859
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:40,109
there's no better answer Jesse like just

860
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:42,119
like there's no better way to do it I

861
00:36:40,108 --> 00:36:44,699
mean we measure all sorts of things in

862
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,410
terms of product quality and the KPI is

863
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:48,210
our bike you know grams per square foot

864
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:50,308
or whatever but the fact is it comes

865
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:52,079
down to bag appeal and it comes down to

866
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:53,430
does it move through the stores you know

867
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,039
if it's going towards the smoking

868
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:58,949
process people have got to see it smoke

869
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,930
it want it it's almost as much brand and

870
00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:04,018
marketing as it is the actual physical

871
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:05,639
curing of it right so yeah great point

872
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:06,809
Robin something I want to add to that

873
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:11,129
too is that

874
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:13,409
there there's an ideal time or product

875
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,300
that we want to get but it's important

876
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:17,549
to understand the market pressures maybe

877
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,440
this doesn't quite apply to the six

878
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,910
plant grower or the craft consumer

879
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,280
that's growing cannabis for themselves

880
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:25,049
but a lot of times I think Rob you can

881
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,000
back me up here when we have

882
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,860
conversations at scale on hearing

883
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,900
there's a time line that doesn't

884
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,090
necessarily correlate to the curing

885
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,700
process that needs to be met and that's

886
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:38,820
a time line to get products into a space

887
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:40,769
out of a space and onto the shelf and I

888
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:43,470
think the more that we master that

889
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:45,239
process at a high commercial level the

890
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,799
more we'll see high quality products

891
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:49,289
come out of those commercial facilities

892
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,590
on a consistent basis what's happening

893
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:54,989
now I think just an opinion here is that

894
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:57,240
there's a race to market there's a need

895
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:59,159
of product in the market and that sort

896
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:02,039
of demands that these products get

897
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:04,230
pushed to market more quickly it's about

898
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,989
getting them out of the room in seven

899
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,550
days burping them in three bagging them

900
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:10,409
and moving them rather than

901
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:13,769
fundamentally understanding how we're

902
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:17,069
going to get 2% more THC 1% more terpene

903
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:18,480
and more flavonoid expression so for me

904
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:20,130
there's a pressure that goes on there

905
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,710
too that needs to be considered because

906
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,300
it's a real market pressure so we need

907
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,849
to work within these certain frameworks

908
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,920
so a lot of times when is it ready is a

909
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:31,139
matter of when can I get my money and

910
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,829
that limits some of the data that we've

911
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:36,929
been able to collect as we pursue more

912
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:38,730
can of Sewer products we see that yeah

913
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:41,639
that curing process takes a little bit

914
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:43,740
longer the product has better shelf life

915
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:45,629
and gets more money at the end that's a

916
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:47,849
long-winded and maybe didn't perfectly

917
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:50,130
answer the question but there's a little

918
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:52,650
bit of insight there I think well I

919
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:54,720
think we can also use this topic to

920
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:57,030
address Alexander's question which is

921
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:59,069
having separate rooms for dry cure has

922
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:01,710
been used to support perpetual grows can

923
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,780
you address this well the reason that a

924
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,760
separate room for drying and curing have

925
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,130
been used for perpetual grows is because

926
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,140
I've got two weeks in between harvests

927
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:12,360
and I have you know a drying room in a

928
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:14,699
curing room and if I do anything just

929
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,170
throw off the balance of my harvest I've

930
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:18,599
got to be able to move product through

931
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,190
my facility I think where we're going

932
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,170
with this is to

933
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,240
the state-of-the-art why aren't we

934
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:26,250
drying and curing in seven days you know

935
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,739
Jesse just mentioned seven-day DRI

936
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,780
three-day here a three-day bag that kind

937
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:32,579
of thing we're trying to compress the

938
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:36,300
drying and curing process by

939
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:38,429
manipulating variables and minimize the

940
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,560
infrastructure and facility you need to

941
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:41,879
take care of this process that's going

942
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,369
to be the next step and this is where

943
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,930
we're trying to push this if we're just

944
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:47,640
gonna be talking about having a separate

945
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:51,389
room for drying in a separate room for

946
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:53,670
curing sure you can go down any any path

947
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:57,210
you want to achieve the net effect but

948
00:39:53,670 --> 00:40:00,000
at the end of the day you're you will be

949
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:02,730
better served if you can if you can hone

950
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,590
these homies processes and really

951
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,349
optimize the system that you're working

952
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:09,720
with

953
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:11,549
yeah great thanks very much and that I

954
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:12,959
would encourage everybody that's more

955
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:16,500
interested in some of the financial

956
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,599
impacts that this can have go to go to

957
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:22,320
the Revenue calculator and play with

958
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:26,250
some of those variables and see what how

959
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,050
much how much revenue or drop in

960
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:31,920
operating costs you might be able to

961
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:34,859
achieve by like getting more dollars per

962
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,289
pound on better cured cannabis lower

963
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:41,009
lordalu or lowering your operating cost

964
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:43,529
and on top of that like if you have any

965
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,150
more questions about curing and you want

966
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:47,820
to take a deeper dive you know reach out

967
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,050
to rob and I you know maybe we won't

968
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,000
talk to you until 2:00 in the morning

969
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,410
like we talk to each other but we'll

970
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,179
definitely get back to you and we love

971
00:40:52,409 --> 00:41:01,049
to hear questions and contributions from

972
00:40:54,179 --> 00:41:02,669
the community so thanks for the other

973
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,680
questions come in you have recommended

974
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,829
temperature and humidity conditions for

975
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:11,858
storing cannabis

976
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:13,839
it's been driving here yeah we've been

977
00:41:11,858 --> 00:41:16,989
asked that question quite a bit so after

978
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:19,058
after it's been dried and cured you know

979
00:41:16,989 --> 00:41:20,289
I think you mentioned Jessie mapped and

980
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,329
that's it's a really good way to

981
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:24,309
maintain the quality and the

982
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:26,380
environmental control of a product in

983
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:27,819
one specific aspect which is moisture

984
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,880
control in the container which is

985
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:33,940
storing it I think those things there

986
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,709
are secondary gasses that are also being

987
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,450
controlled and their levels being

988
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:40,449
controlled that you know I don't know

989
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:42,368
enough about map systems but they seem

990
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:44,889
to do a very good job and I mean Jesse

991
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:48,249
you tell me is that the typical way to

992
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:49,989
do things on the market today then times

993
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:50,968
on nitrogen flush and and what that's

994
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:53,889
all about

995
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:56,108
yeah I mean that that brings up all

996
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:58,748
other ball of wax but I think for the

997
00:41:56,108 --> 00:42:01,150
most part I mean we know the the

998
00:41:58,748 --> 00:42:03,429
cardinal factors that influence the plan

999
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:05,289
and cause degradation and once that

1000
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:07,748
process the enzymatic process is halted

1001
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,069
and we've removed enough moisture it's

1002
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:11,348
really sort of about light and

1003
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,849
temperature so have putting it into a

1004
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:14,739
container where light doesn't penetrate

1005
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:17,798
and temperature doesn't have a direct

1006
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:19,329
impact will be beneficial and I think

1007
00:42:17,798 --> 00:42:21,278
we've seen a lot of people look to

1008
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:23,829
commercial agriculture and commercial

1009
00:42:21,278 --> 00:42:24,699
packaging for solutions here which is

1010
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:26,729
why we tend to have a lot of

1011
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:30,400
conversations about nitrogen purging

1012
00:42:26,728 --> 00:42:32,968
essentially bringing in into gas into a

1013
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,858
controlled space like a 55-gallon drum

1014
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:38,289
which will essentially displace the

1015
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:41,139
oxygen so that oxidation process won't

1016
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:43,569
continue the idea is that now that will

1017
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:45,998
hold in that state for a long period of

1018
00:42:43,568 --> 00:42:47,679
time and it can be shipped overseas or

1019
00:42:45,998 --> 00:42:50,588
wherever it needs to go or just held on

1020
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:53,828
site to appropriate processing time the

1021
00:42:50,588 --> 00:42:55,268
issues we see with that are that we're

1022
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:56,890
not exactly sure if there's a

1023
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:59,018
degradation associated with that

1024
00:42:56,889 --> 00:43:01,538
nitrogen gas but what we do know is it's

1025
00:42:59,018 --> 00:43:03,399
been in these holding cells these

1026
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:05,979
55-gallon drums let's call them for

1027
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,079
conversation usually they're done in

1028
00:43:05,978 --> 00:43:11,618
metal drums for good long-term holding

1029
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,719
for safety those drums are lined and as

1030
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:16,449
those drums are impacted by atmospheric

1031
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:19,389
conditions and temperature the terpenes

1032
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:21,068
sweat and get absorbed by the liner

1033
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:23,588
now in a long-term holding environment

1034
00:43:21,068 --> 00:43:26,199
you have to smoke the drums to get high

1035
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:29,500
that tends to not have a lot of market

1036
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:31,268
their viability so that that's one of

1037
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,858
the situations we've seen come with long

1038
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:34,538
term holding and nitrogen purging in

1039
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:37,719
large spaces especially metal drums that

1040
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:39,880
are line but really it's about you know

1041
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:41,889
halting that oxidation process and if

1042
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,329
you can stop photo oxidation and auto

1043
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:45,598
oxidation by preventing light

1044
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:47,589
penetration that's a huge first step

1045
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,450
secondarily if we can continue to

1046
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:51,969
control the temperature we'll have much

1047
00:43:49,449 --> 00:43:55,328
less volatile and and evaporation of

1048
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:57,278
those secondary metabolites I think

1049
00:43:55,329 --> 00:44:01,150
there's a correlation here see our

1050
00:43:57,278 --> 00:44:04,599
corollary between weed and wine right if

1051
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:06,338
you want to hold on to wine for a long

1052
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:09,880
period of time you put it in an opaque

1053
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:11,768
bottle you use a core oven to seal the

1054
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,329
thing with nitrogen on top so that after

1055
00:44:11,768 --> 00:44:15,338
you've opened it you purge that oxygen

1056
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:17,410
out you print prevent oxygenation and

1057
00:44:15,338 --> 00:44:19,058
you store the thing in a cool place I

1058
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:20,259
think the same thing applies to weed

1059
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:23,039
here if you're trying to maintain those

1060
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:26,140
those same flavor profiles in weed

1061
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:29,920
that's good point let's see let's move

1062
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:32,618
on to a question about the mechanical

1063
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,240
side of things how do you determine the

1064
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:37,390
mechanical needs for a drying room

1065
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:40,989
there's been several questions similar

1066
00:44:37,389 --> 00:44:44,318
to this yeah there's a good one too

1067
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:45,818
because I see Nadia and Nadia's asked a

1068
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:47,679
question about you know moisture removal

1069
00:44:45,818 --> 00:44:51,219
in the first 24 or 48 hours that kind of

1070
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:54,159
thing Tim to Andy I want to start off by

1071
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:58,118
saying that every every traditional

1072
00:44:54,159 --> 00:45:00,429
drying we room we go into they the

1073
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:01,539
impression is they want the people who

1074
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:03,969
are doing the drawing will want to

1075
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:06,250
remove the most amount of moisture in

1076
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:08,649
the first 24 or 48 hours we're gonna

1077
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:12,639
remove 40 to 50 percent of moisture in

1078
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:14,470
the first 48 hours I think there's

1079
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:18,518
there's two things here I think people

1080
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:21,518
are seeing that their rooms are under

1081
00:45:18,518 --> 00:45:23,258
designed and as such they can't maintain

1082
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:25,750
a temperature and humidity anyways they

1083
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:28,960
set the set points on the thermostat and

1084
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,969
the humidistat but they end up losing

1085
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,099
control because they don't have enough

1086
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:34,569
moisture removal capacity which

1087
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:36,309
means that if they don't have

1088
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,320
independent temperature and humidity

1089
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:39,670
control the humidity levels go way out

1090
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,220
of whack and then the temperature

1091
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:44,829
control goes with it it's one thing to

1092
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:47,109
say you want to remove most of the

1093
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:49,389
moisture in the first 24 or 48 hours I

1094
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:51,099
don't think that's a necessary step IV

1095
00:45:49,389 --> 00:45:53,379
you can control temperature and humidity

1096
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:54,969
you can do a very linear moisture

1097
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,430
removal over time and that's going to

1098
00:45:54,969 --> 00:46:00,909
lead to a consistent moisture profile

1099
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:02,049
inside and through the bud so that's

1100
00:46:00,909 --> 00:46:04,480
what we're trying to go for here we're

1101
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:07,630
trying to avoid pockets of wet product

1102
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,490
inside the bud that can lead to the

1103
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,110
pathogen expression and when the

1104
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:12,539
pathogen build up that we're trying to

1105
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:16,240
avoid in the first place to maintain

1106
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:17,860
product quality so you know how do we

1107
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:20,589
how do we size these systems

1108
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:22,120
you guys go back to what does the grower

1109
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:24,370
really want to do or what does the

1110
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:28,750
harvester processor really want to do

1111
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:30,940
with the product are they going to if

1112
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:33,730
they had their way could they control

1113
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:36,250
the product quality over time by doing a

1114
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:38,230
very linear moisture removal the same

1115
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,789
amount of water take just taken out of

1116
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,610
the plant every single day in the

1117
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:45,039
seven-day 10-day three-day drying period

1118
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:47,940
well I kind of accenting it comes with

1119
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:50,889
control it comes with sizing correctly

1120
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,360
we do have our own product input sheets

1121
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:55,029
that we can talk you know we can have

1122
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:58,269
you fill out and then talk about the

1123
00:46:55,030 --> 00:47:01,300
process after that it's you know it's a

1124
00:46:58,269 --> 00:47:03,550
matter of understanding best influence

1125
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,010
of temperature and humidity on product

1126
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:09,300
weight over time just you have any

1127
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:12,730
comments about that linear linear drying

1128
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:15,820
gras yeah I think it's sort of it sort

1129
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:20,110
of speaks to a couple of different

1130
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:23,140
processes that cost a lot of energy to

1131
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:25,059
restart once they or re-energize once

1132
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:28,900
they slow down what I mean by that is

1133
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:30,369
that when you have you know a big spike

1134
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,920
in moisture removal it's usually

1135
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:36,819
associated with a spike in elevated

1136
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:38,680
temperature which can have the ability

1137
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:43,000
to text effects on those secondary

1138
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:45,509
metabolites but you would it I what I

1139
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,869
think it really comes down to is

1140
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:50,548
precision control and putting this wet

1141
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,259
weight in there and knowing how much

1142
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:56,130
you're going to remove over the course

1143
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:58,228
of time allows you to sort of game plan

1144
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:00,869
for how long it's going to take with the

1145
00:47:58,228 --> 00:48:03,928
appropriate temperature and humidity set

1146
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:08,219
points the spikes in temperature and

1147
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:10,349
humidity either too high or too low you

1148
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:12,630
know do things to enzymatic processes so

1149
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:15,209
if you speed up the enzymatic process

1150
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:17,608
early on and then you denature the

1151
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:20,308
process later you're not going to have

1152
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:22,858
completion of enzymatic processes so

1153
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:25,139
that linear line that Rob talks about is

1154
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:27,449
really sort of the concept of curing we

1155
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:28,979
have water pressure that pushes the oils

1156
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:31,469
to the outside we have the enzymatic

1157
00:48:28,978 --> 00:48:33,838
process which is fundamentally driven by

1158
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:36,568
water and temperature and if we have

1159
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:38,998
spikes we can have enzymes just sort of

1160
00:48:36,568 --> 00:48:40,409
you know go crazy and then die off

1161
00:48:38,998 --> 00:48:42,118
we need them to all sort of work

1162
00:48:40,409 --> 00:48:43,858
together with enough time in the

1163
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,019
appropriate environment to break down

1164
00:48:43,858 --> 00:48:49,078
the things they need to break down we've

1165
00:48:46,018 --> 00:48:51,208
seen this technique applied with a

1166
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:53,909
little bit higher temperatures to remove

1167
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:55,858
a lot of moisture and inevitably the

1168
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:59,729
smoke is a little bit more harsh and

1169
00:48:55,858 --> 00:49:02,518
tends to test a little bit lower on the

1170
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:04,528
THC and terpene scale relative to the

1171
00:49:02,518 --> 00:49:06,478
biomass that's there there's still stuff

1172
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:09,088
remaining in the bud that compromises

1173
00:49:06,478 --> 00:49:10,768
that test result so although it's it's a

1174
00:49:09,088 --> 00:49:13,798
wonderful conversation especially

1175
00:49:10,768 --> 00:49:17,129
talking about retarding microbe growth

1176
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:19,318
and getting down to that 20% but if we

1177
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:22,169
do it in a linear fashion it doesn't

1178
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:24,808
allow moisture to be rican sumed by the

1179
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:27,208
by the cannabis then we know that we are

1180
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:27,899
moving to a finish line and not moving

1181
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:31,558
in a circle

1182
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:34,618
if that makes sense yeah well to your

1183
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:36,329
point about curing being an art as well

1184
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:40,528
as a science I have a feeling you

1185
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:45,028
probably have some specific methods in

1186
00:49:40,528 --> 00:49:47,608
your sleeve to bring bring a fantastic

1187
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:48,690
finished product to market that involve

1188
00:49:47,608 --> 00:49:51,690
different

1189
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:53,309
princess once along the way but you know

1190
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,690
that's loaded Brian you've been a part

1191
00:49:53,309 --> 00:49:56,190
of these conversations where I've been

1192
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:57,809
screaming and yelling about five

1193
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,519
different ways that I think are great to

1194
00:49:57,809 --> 00:50:01,559
do it and win a cannabis cup and and

1195
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:02,969
then you know we talked about whether or

1196
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:04,980
not those are possible and the real

1197
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:07,019
science involved so yeah absolutely

1198
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,730
we're still in the mode of discovery the

1199
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:10,679
proof is in the pudding really good weed

1200
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:12,480
is really good weed it's undeniable

1201
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:14,009
I think interpreting is a big factor

1202
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,568
here and really determining what good

1203
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,680
weed is but the market will tell you

1204
00:50:15,568 --> 00:50:19,619
price point

1205
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:21,719
use use sell through numbers and brand

1206
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:23,369
recognition are a big factor because

1207
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:26,338
they're tied directly back to the

1208
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:28,200
product you produce well word has it

1209
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:32,429
you've won a cannabis cup but in your

1210
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:34,379
day maybe back in my day I may have won

1211
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:36,210
many others with genetics but I bred

1212
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:39,450
that I didn't actually compete with too

1213
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:43,380
so it's a fun game to be a part of all

1214
00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:45,960
right very cool got another question

1215
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:49,940
here about turkeys what percent terpenes

1216
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:52,170
would you call high chirping content man

1217
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:55,048
it's interesting you know because we see

1218
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:57,838
a lot of different test results but you

1219
00:50:55,048 --> 00:51:00,960
know I think I saw some granddaddy

1220
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:03,630
purple test it like 4% one time which is

1221
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,720
sort of a real high mind-blowing number

1222
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:10,588
and somewhere around 2% as far as a mass

1223
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:14,399
mass collection of terpenes usually is

1224
00:51:10,588 --> 00:51:17,400
pretty good but again I think that the

1225
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:21,240
quantity of terpenes although very

1226
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,950
important and measurable the symphonie

1227
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:28,019
that's created through polymerization

1228
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:31,379
has been shown to just be more medically

1229
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:34,889
effective or more psycho actively viable

1230
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:37,500
for recreational products the quantity

1231
00:51:34,889 --> 00:51:39,838
of terpenes is important but more

1232
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:42,000
important is the quality of each turkey

1233
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,489
as I talked about the trichrome heads

1234
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,440
they need to remain intact because they

1235
00:51:44,489 --> 00:51:48,538
have the secretory cells and the

1236
00:51:46,440 --> 00:52:00,298
secretory vesicles that contain

1237
00:51:48,539 --> 00:52:01,960
cannabinoids and terpenoids a lot of

1238
00:52:00,298 --> 00:52:04,329
ways to get it done and I think there

1239
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:07,929
we're just sort of trying to figure it

1240
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:10,420
out that's a good point I think when

1241
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:14,319
you're when you're testing terpenes you

1242
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:17,349
get just a overall an overall percentage

1243
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:19,630
but you don't get you may not always get

1244
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:22,619
to full the full profile or spectrums

1245
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:24,760
those quantity and yeah but also quality

1246
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:26,588
yeah man maybe we should think about

1247
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,000
having a conversation about why we

1248
00:52:26,588 --> 00:52:30,400
should talk about spectrum and

1249
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,650
cannabinoid profile in the same vein

1250
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,750
that we talked about 40 percent THC test

1251
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,820
results and four percent 13 results you

1252
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,889
know what about that could cost me what

1253
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:42,309
if I'm Way more high off above the test

1254
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:44,588
at 18% than 28% it's happened I'd been

1255
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:46,809
there was about the bud variability or

1256
00:52:44,588 --> 00:52:50,349
was it the polymerization process that

1257
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:52,509
made me so much happier at 18% a lot of

1258
00:52:50,349 --> 00:52:58,240
considerations there and subjective as

1259
00:52:52,510 --> 00:53:01,080
well implications for for therapeutic

1260
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:03,329
uses and medicinal uses as well

1261
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:05,619
absolutely

1262
00:53:03,329 --> 00:53:09,358
all right and with shift gears back to

1263
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:14,099
the mechanical side you have recommended

1264
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:14,098
specific air flow velocities for Karen

1265
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:23,969
no I don't the idea of a sort

1266
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:28,000
lots of velocity ton low velocity so

1267
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:30,189
we've seen some data for different herbs

1268
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,260
that dry out and meaning cannabis we've

1269
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:34,210
seen to see the numbers that if you're

1270
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:36,250
maintaining consistent temperatures and

1271
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:39,369
humidity it's the condition of the air

1272
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:42,070
that matters more than the velocity of

1273
00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:44,950
the air so that end it's important that

1274
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:47,019
you get the conditioned air to this to

1275
00:53:44,949 --> 00:53:50,559
the product that you're trying to cure

1276
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:52,509
and dry but it's the quality and

1277
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,880
quantity rather of humidity in the air

1278
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:57,330
the temperature of the air that's going

1279
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:01,000
to affect the drawing out process so

1280
00:53:57,329 --> 00:54:02,619
just make sure you have air flow the it

1281
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,750
doesn't matter if you go faster so this

1282
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:07,030
with the data showed us if you have way

1283
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:08,949
too much air that's not a bad thing if

1284
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:11,380
you have way too little that's a very

1285
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:12,879
bad thing just get enough air to the

1286
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,480
product so that you can think

1287
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,160
homogenized the atmosphere

1288
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,000
inside the room in not developed pockets

1289
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:21,409
of moisture retention inside the bud I

1290
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,630
think you know something that we're

1291
00:54:21,409 --> 00:54:25,039
still exploring here too and I think Rob

1292
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:26,809
and I have seen a little bit of

1293
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:28,519
differential data here's it you're

1294
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:31,099
really not going to blow the trichomes

1295
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:32,239
off the plant with air velocity it's

1296
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:34,759
just something I want to bring up here

1297
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:36,259
that you don't worry about applying so

1298
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,990
much air that you think the trichomes

1299
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:41,240
are gonna volatize or blow away that

1300
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:43,159
that mechanical processes and what's

1301
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:46,669
causing the evaporation of trichrome so

1302
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:48,019
just wanted to put that out there yes if

1303
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:53,690
anyone knows sure they know it's just a

1304
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:56,230
blast it with air that's money okay

1305
00:54:53,690 --> 00:55:01,400
great

1306
00:54:56,230 --> 00:55:03,108
some questions coming in about different

1307
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:08,000
different molecules in the air maybe we

1308
00:55:03,108 --> 00:55:10,549
can combine a couple here but questions

1309
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,679
from NOAA is there any benefit to

1310
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:16,369
drawing your journey in a more inert

1311
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:18,858
environment to limit exposure to o2 like

1312
00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:21,710
an argon or co2 atmosphere with this

1313
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:24,049
inhibit enzymatic activity and and maybe

1314
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:29,990
we can also address the concept of

1315
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:32,750
ethylene yeah I think great question

1316
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:35,179
great question Noah and I think that you

1317
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,710
know one of the reasons we talk so much

1318
00:55:35,179 --> 00:55:37,940
about math is that we know the

1319
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:39,740
importance of these environmental

1320
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:42,440
conditions and that they need to be

1321
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:44,750
controlled and I think you nailed that

1322
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:47,269
you alluded to it right the lack of

1323
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:50,210
oxygen in the space or not enough oxygen

1324
00:55:47,269 --> 00:55:52,849
in the space is going to slow down

1325
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:54,849
respiration prevent enzymatic activity

1326
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:57,589
and could lead to anaerobic fermentation

1327
00:55:54,849 --> 00:56:00,139
so it's important to control that

1328
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:01,579
environment but it's also important to

1329
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:03,289
know what's in the air because there's

1330
00:56:01,579 --> 00:56:05,210
an amount of oxygen that's probably

1331
00:56:03,289 --> 00:56:07,039
accept acceptable that doesn't have a

1332
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:10,010
huge negative impact that still

1333
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:12,380
facilitates the process might even be

1334
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:14,240
necessary for the process right I do

1335
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,920
believe it is necessary although there's

1336
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,689
oxygen within the plant and the cell

1337
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,340
tissues I think that oxygen in the

1338
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:22,190
environment is also of critical

1339
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:24,140
importance and studies show that I'm

1340
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:27,200
scared to get too far down the road of

1341
00:56:24,139 --> 00:56:28,819
ethylene because it's such a fun topic

1342
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:31,619
for me to think

1343
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:34,500
my experience in growing cannabis you

1344
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:36,029
know is more than 15 years now and when

1345
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,639
I first started growing after I

1346
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:42,110
graduated from Cal I found that the

1347
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:45,569
knowledge was legacy authors and tomato

1348
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:48,480
studies so white papers on tomatoes and

1349
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:50,340
books by guys like Ed Rosenthal and you

1350
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:54,480
know forefathers of the industry and

1351
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:57,660
that information you know it was in its

1352
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,420
infancy we've come a long way since then

1353
00:56:57,659 --> 00:57:02,159
and I laugh because I rarely think about

1354
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,110
tomatoes anymore when I cultivate

1355
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:05,879
cannabis but when this ethylene

1356
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:08,789
conversation comes up I can't help

1357
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:11,910
myself you know in commercial tomato

1358
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:14,460
production we know that ethylene is a

1359
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:16,889
popular solution to packaging and

1360
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:19,619
creating deliverables you know ethylene

1361
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:23,190
is a hormone and they usually deliver it

1362
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:23,699
as an external gas if you don't know you

1363
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,800
know

1364
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:28,589
tomatoes are picked green and then

1365
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,750
basically gasped before sale in order to

1366
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:33,600
change the color change the texture and

1367
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:35,219
change the flavor further development of

1368
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,739
this product and give it more market

1369
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:40,289
share and value so my question always

1370
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:43,889
sort of comes down to well in tomato

1371
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:46,800
production it's a hundred to 150 ppm of

1372
00:57:43,889 --> 00:57:49,940
ethylene over the course of a 24 to 48

1373
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:53,000
hour period with high humidity levels

1374
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:55,590
85% or so and that triggers that

1375
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,750
enzymatic reaction chemical reaction

1376
00:57:55,590 --> 00:58:00,600
within the tomato to make it a better

1377
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:01,530
product so as I go further down this

1378
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:05,119
path

1379
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:08,550
I'm intent on studying the effects of

1380
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:10,799
ethylene the build-up of ethylene in the

1381
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:14,100
space specifically in airtight

1382
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:16,920
environments under pressure I think it

1383
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:18,299
can have a dramatic influence I want to

1384
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,639
say that we're still exploring it

1385
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,830
although it is a very popular approach

1386
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:25,259
in commercial agriculture so there's a

1387
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:27,150
lot of quote unquote tomato data to look

1388
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:30,120
at we just don't have anything on

1389
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:33,869
cannabis yet but also on a side note you

1390
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:35,909
know we've talked to facilities and this

1391
00:58:33,869 --> 00:58:38,759
is third-party data that we've collected

1392
00:58:35,909 --> 00:58:40,440
just from conversations but have have

1393
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,960
expressed concern for

1394
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:45,240
whereas alene leaks in their facilities

1395
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,099
or greenhouses because they've had

1396
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:48,809
situations where they've tested high

1397
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:52,289
levels of ethylene higher than normal

1398
00:58:48,809 --> 00:58:55,170
and their entire harvest you know will

1399
00:58:52,289 --> 00:58:55,920
be two weeks early with cloudy - amber

1400
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,750
trichomes

1401
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,400
two weeks before they extended and the

1402
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:02,179
in such a growth right

1403
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:04,349
lack of biomass lack of development

1404
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:06,088
nightmare and harvesting because now

1405
00:59:04,349 --> 00:59:08,369
you're pulling down every single Bay

1406
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:10,769
rather than a week by week staggered

1407
00:59:08,369 --> 00:59:12,869
approach so we know ethylene has an

1408
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:14,670
impact on cannabis we're still trying to

1409
00:59:12,869 --> 00:59:17,730
figure out how it impacts the curing

1410
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:20,338
process we know it's a byproduct but we

1411
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:22,980
don't know the effects of the PPM's and

1412
00:59:20,338 --> 00:59:26,699
pressures associated with that so we're

1413
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:31,679
still sort of exploring that if that

1414
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:33,899
makes little sense it's really not even

1415
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:35,578
a comment here about greenhouse tomatoes

1416
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,838
being picked vine-ripened of course

1417
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:40,440
because everything's better the

1418
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:44,190
greenhouse and vine-ripened Tomatoes are

1419
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:46,200
better house is opinion in a in as a guy

1420
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:48,599
who has tomatoes in his backyard I will

1421
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:51,719
preach let the tomato ripen on the vine

1422
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:54,210
it has more access to sugars and

1423
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:56,789
products to develop it's going to be

1424
00:59:54,210 --> 01:00:00,150
better what I'm bringing up here is just

1425
00:59:56,789 --> 01:00:02,550
simply the market pressures of producing

1426
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:04,858
Tomatoes at scale which are now starting

1427
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:07,200
to impact cannabis production as well

1428
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:09,480
and I think it's important to look at

1429
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:13,230
some of those you sure let's have the

1430
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:15,449
craft grower that you know cures for 60

1431
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:17,550
days and gets a better product without

1432
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:19,379
any ethylene and complete control I

1433
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:21,990
think that would be a superior product

1434
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:24,269
but market factors might not allow that

1435
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:27,929
to happen so we might need to look for

1436
01:00:24,269 --> 01:00:30,150
appropriate organic natural elements to

1437
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:33,588
help us influence that product and make

1438
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:36,480
it a better product for final final use

1439
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:37,619
that's that's sort of I had totally

1440
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,150
understand what Nadia saying she's

1441
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:40,890
absolutely right

1442
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:42,630
I just saying that there's there's a

1443
01:00:40,889 --> 01:00:44,789
differential application here that might

1444
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:46,380
be applied to someone in a certain level

1445
01:00:44,789 --> 01:00:50,429
of scale with a certain style of

1446
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:52,730
cultivation and distribution hopefully

1447
01:00:50,429 --> 01:00:58,039
that helps answer the question

1448
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:59,860
a couple more on the mechanical side and

1449
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:02,269
your opinion our steam humidifier

1450
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:04,280
humidifiers a requirement for a dry room

1451
01:01:02,269 --> 01:01:06,110
and then are you recommending hepa

1452
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:11,060
filtration on supply side to protect

1453
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:13,640
plants our steam humidifiers that do you

1454
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:17,029
say yeah steam humidifier is a

1455
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:18,319
requirement for a dry room yeah I would

1456
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:20,960
say absolutely not unless you're doing

1457
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,880
this in a desert and you've ended up

1458
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,369
over drying your product and need to get

1459
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,769
moisture back in but even then you can

1460
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:29,089
be able to just still don't do it right

1461
01:01:27,769 --> 01:01:32,690
I would definitely not use a steam

1462
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:36,050
humidifier you might as well use a you

1463
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:37,280
know adiabatic cooler inside your space

1464
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:40,610
to do that

1465
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,260
famous get the same effect and then yeah

1466
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:44,030
I don't know you know if you're trying

1467
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:46,700
to rehydrate your product you might run

1468
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:49,250
into a challenge if you have the right

1469
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:51,589
mechanical equipment you don't have to

1470
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:53,210
worry about going below the dew point in

1471
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:54,950
the room and then over drawing your

1472
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:57,199
product because you've got the right

1473
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:58,279
systems in place to make it all work and

1474
01:01:57,199 --> 01:01:59,779
then in the data there are gonna be

1475
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,550
systems that are fighting each other you

1476
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:03,320
should have enough water in the product

1477
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:04,760
itself and not have to take so much of

1478
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,830
it out you have to put some back in

1479
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:09,830
which just conflates the whole project

1480
01:02:06,829 --> 01:02:11,569
the whole process and in terms of HEPA

1481
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:13,549
filtration I'm gonna so the hepa

1482
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:15,380
filtration is necessarily a great idea I

1483
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:17,390
mean HEPA filters are so good they're

1484
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:20,059
gonna take out some of those VOCs out of

1485
01:02:17,389 --> 01:02:21,859
the air as well as the particular you're

1486
01:02:20,059 --> 01:02:24,139
trying to avoid but the pathogens were

1487
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:26,240
worried about are generally captured

1488
01:02:24,139 --> 01:02:29,179
with a really good myrrh 13 filter that

1489
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:31,519
hasn't been cut become gummed up and you

1490
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:33,109
know started letting more particles

1491
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:35,719
through because it's blown out because

1492
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:37,490
the filter hasn't been changed so just

1493
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:40,159
using really good Murph 13 filter and

1494
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:42,979
avoid the extra energy penalty and first

1495
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:49,279
cost and ongoing cost of replacing those

1496
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:51,760
HEPA filters just someone ownerís yeah

1497
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,960
make sense

1498
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,570
what kind of diffusers would you

1499
01:02:53,960 --> 01:03:00,829
recommend for a combination giant your

1500
01:02:56,570 --> 01:03:02,570
room any any thoughts there yeah I'd say

1501
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:05,179
that any diffusers that get air moving

1502
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,559
through the room will work again we

1503
01:03:05,179 --> 01:03:07,909
don't

1504
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:09,079
you know we can make recommendations on

1505
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:12,699
that but the other day we'd like to

1506
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:15,079
model every room that we're in because I

1507
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:17,539
know I can make a recommendation but if

1508
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:19,909
I can't actually see it happen you know

1509
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:22,340
with a smoke test or with a CFD model

1510
01:03:19,909 --> 01:03:24,379
I don't like trust it seeing is

1511
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,390
believing for me so we've just seen a

1512
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,890
lot of a lot of limbs get designed with

1513
01:03:26,389 --> 01:03:31,608
the best of intentions and did not work

1514
01:03:27,889 --> 01:03:33,710
out so well and we like to we like to

1515
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:36,170
think about that before we start making

1516
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:38,079
recommendations one of things I've seen

1517
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:40,070
that you know I thought was a great idea

1518
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:42,980
counter-intuitively ended up not being a

1519
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:45,800
great idea was those linear type

1520
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:49,010
diffusers on one wall supplying air and

1521
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:50,240
then a returned grill basically making

1522
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:52,720
up the other wall you have this like

1523
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:55,009
very linear airflow through the room

1524
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:56,659
well that's sounding a great idea

1525
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:59,180
because you'd have good laminar flow

1526
01:03:56,659 --> 01:04:01,909
through the entire space the question

1527
01:03:59,179 --> 01:04:05,379
becomes where do you put the temperature

1528
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:08,989
and humidity sensor for that space as

1529
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:13,130
you go through the room that air quality

1530
01:04:08,989 --> 01:04:16,159
will change as it either picks up or in

1531
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:18,970
other ways changes the air quality

1532
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:22,730
changes as it goes past the product so

1533
01:04:18,969 --> 01:04:24,169
it's a very tough thing to for me to

1534
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:26,358
recommend using one of those type

1535
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:28,220
systems I prefer a room that mix as well

1536
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:30,619
I want a room that's mixing the air

1537
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:32,629
constantly so I have a homogeneous

1538
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:34,880
atmosphere around all of the product

1539
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:37,369
that's inside that room as opposed to

1540
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,130
doing that linear airflow across it

1541
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:42,470
where I only know based on my sensors

1542
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:44,300
and humidities my temperature humidity

1543
01:04:42,469 --> 01:04:46,489
sensors I only know the temperature and

1544
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:49,640
humidity and can control the one spot in

1545
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:52,519
the room essentially so mixing is better

1546
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:54,079
lots of sensors in a mixed well mixed

1547
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:55,579
environment will give you a pretty good

1548
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,019
idea if you've got the mixing you need

1549
01:04:55,579 --> 01:04:59,358
and I'll help you achieve that

1550
01:04:57,019 --> 01:05:04,130
homogeneous environment how's that

1551
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:07,670
answer the question that's great I think

1552
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:12,380
I think you took that one over over and

1553
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:14,599
above thank you what is the ideal

1554
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:17,380
moisture content and water activity for

1555
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:17,380
a final product

1556
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:24,639
to each their own well I'm not let's go

1557
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:26,260
so you want yeah but I mean be if the

1558
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:27,960
idea is though and I think there's been

1559
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:30,400
proven in a couple of studies is that

1560
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,530
you know we have to reduce that water

1561
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,940
activity and we have to get the moisture

1562
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:36,490
content of the bud below 20 percent

1563
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:38,318
otherwise there'll be enough energy and

1564
01:05:36,489 --> 01:05:40,989
activity to stimulate microbial growth

1565
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:44,019
and pathogens and bud rot and all that

1566
01:05:40,989 --> 01:05:46,959
stuff that's going on so there are some

1567
01:05:44,019 --> 01:05:49,119
thresholds that we need to abide by but

1568
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,769
you know I think this is a great point

1569
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:53,410
right I had mentioned that the

1570
01:05:50,769 --> 01:05:57,670
difference between you know 5% water

1571
01:05:53,409 --> 01:06:00,578
weights worth millions but also that

1572
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:02,048
water weight might lead to a product

1573
01:06:00,579 --> 01:06:04,630
that's not as well received in the

1574
01:06:02,048 --> 01:06:06,940
marketplace that additional water weight

1575
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:09,849
is going to have lower test results for

1576
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:11,798
THC and terpenes so these are all

1577
01:06:09,849 --> 01:06:14,019
factors of considerations that need to

1578
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:16,210
be taken into account although you might

1579
01:06:14,019 --> 01:06:19,179
be able to capture more money weight by

1580
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:21,190
selling that water people are not going

1581
01:06:19,179 --> 01:06:25,239
to appreciate it as much as a smoke that

1582
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:27,429
burns cleaner burns easier and doesn't

1583
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:29,889
have those those remnants in there I

1584
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:31,719
think that this is a big portion where

1585
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:33,969
you get to sort of define your signature

1586
01:06:31,719 --> 01:06:36,368
it's about time line it's about

1587
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:39,699
balancing of terpene loss and enzymatic

1588
01:06:36,369 --> 01:06:41,710
activity you know it's sort of about how

1589
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:44,348
much water content you want to leave in

1590
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:46,210
that product if you're at 20 percent the

1591
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:48,880
likelihood of winning a cannabis cup is

1592
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:50,980
low the product won't smoke well in a

1593
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,530
joint or the traditional testing testing

1594
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:55,150
methodologies and when vaporized there

1595
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:57,730
are other flavors that you might pick up

1596
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:59,769
from that water vapor whereas a lower

1597
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:03,460
product around 10 percent

1598
01:06:59,769 --> 01:07:06,219
you know moisture in the in the cannabis

1599
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:09,940
bud is much more likely to be received

1600
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:12,519
as a premium product so again it's a

1601
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:13,990
signature balancing act and and market

1602
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:17,500
pressure aspect where you have to

1603
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:19,029
understand you know how much it's worth

1604
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,679
to get better test results and better

1605
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:23,519
product relative to product weight

1606
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:23,519
biomass

1607
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:33,719
another one related to humidity relative

1608
01:07:31,769 --> 01:07:37,050
humidity what what effect is raising the

1609
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:39,629
relative humidity temperature remains

1610
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:46,860
constant on trichomes and turkeys in the

1611
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:50,190
cure to prevent over drying so yeah go

1612
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:51,300
for a rub go for it all right I think we

1613
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:55,829
get two different maybe different

1614
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:57,840
pinions here the vapor pressure of a

1615
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:59,840
particular gas is independent of other

1616
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:03,809
gases so if you're worried about

1617
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:07,320
moisture content inside your plant you

1618
01:08:03,809 --> 01:08:09,449
can decrease the vapor pressure by

1619
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,920
increasing the humidity in the room so

1620
01:08:09,449 --> 01:08:12,599
if all you're doing is hoping to get a

1621
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,250
moisture content reading that is

1622
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:16,229
consistent at the end of the drying and

1623
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:18,359
you don't over dry you need to raise the

1624
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:19,858
relative humidity inside your space to

1625
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:22,770
keep the moisture in the plant and keep

1626
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:26,329
the pressure off the liquid water in the

1627
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:30,089
product from evaporating into the air

1628
01:08:26,329 --> 01:08:31,949
this is something that I need to see

1629
01:08:30,088 --> 01:08:34,588
testing on and this is part of what

1630
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:38,519
we're doing here at inspire I need to

1631
01:08:34,588 --> 01:08:41,399
see that if I increase the terpene the

1632
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:43,920
terpenes in the air that it also applies

1633
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:45,179
the same vapor pressure back to the

1634
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,369
terpenes that are on the plant that

1635
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:51,838
we're trying not to volatize so

1636
01:08:47,369 --> 01:08:54,509
volatilize so if you think a question is

1637
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:56,970
strictly on what is the effect on

1638
01:08:54,509 --> 01:08:59,130
terpenes and THC inside the plant I

1639
01:08:56,970 --> 01:09:00,900
don't have a very good answer if the

1640
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:03,390
question is what is the effect on

1641
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:05,250
moisture content of the product the huge

1642
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:07,230
huge effect increase the relative

1643
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:09,739
humidity to decrease the vapor pressure

1644
01:09:07,229 --> 01:09:12,329
on the water keep the water in the plant

1645
01:09:09,739 --> 01:09:14,548
do not put yourself in a position where

1646
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:16,890
it says high humidity and completely

1647
01:09:14,548 --> 01:09:19,699
unchecked that you have this pathogen

1648
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:23,338
build-up that you can't control so

1649
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:25,769
balancing anybody goes like I totally

1650
01:09:23,338 --> 01:09:28,500
agree with you Rob and I just sort of

1651
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:31,020
want to add a you know historical side

1652
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:35,298
note that I think a lot of people that

1653
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:38,400
pure and the small batch jar philosophy

1654
01:09:35,298 --> 01:09:40,109
you know we all prized that jar because

1655
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,388
we know something magical happens in

1656
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:43,329
there

1657
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:45,609
one conversation is about the relative

1658
01:09:43,328 --> 01:09:47,849
moisture in that space right the

1659
01:09:45,609 --> 01:09:50,409
humidity in that space rising up through

1660
01:09:47,849 --> 01:09:53,078
respiration evapotranspiration in that

1661
01:09:50,408 --> 01:09:55,148
product which actually might have an

1662
01:09:53,078 --> 01:09:57,248
influence the only reason I sort of

1663
01:09:55,149 --> 01:10:00,729
bring that up is that I know that high

1664
01:09:57,248 --> 01:10:02,590
humidities certain gases are gonna

1665
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:05,079
change and have different atmospheric

1666
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:07,569
you know they're gonna impact the but

1667
01:10:05,078 --> 01:10:09,849
differently and that also high humidity

1668
01:10:07,569 --> 01:10:13,268
is going to a you know dramatically

1669
01:10:09,849 --> 01:10:17,498
change the you know effects of ethylene

1670
01:10:13,269 --> 01:10:19,780
or the effects of oxygen so there's a

1671
01:10:17,498 --> 01:10:21,309
lot of variables there that really need

1672
01:10:19,779 --> 01:10:22,988
to be controlled and that's what I was

1673
01:10:21,309 --> 01:10:25,918
glad you nailed on this it's about

1674
01:10:22,988 --> 01:10:30,488
precision control and understanding

1675
01:10:25,918 --> 01:10:32,050
rather than you know just as simple hey

1676
01:10:30,488 --> 01:10:33,938
this is this is the number and this is

1677
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,559
how you get there you know it's sort of

1678
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:37,479
about understanding all those influences

1679
01:10:35,559 --> 01:10:40,449
and impacts that go into that process

1680
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:44,340
and and monitoring and measuring them

1681
01:10:40,448 --> 01:10:44,339
throughout the entire journey

1682
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:54,429
great thoughts on HDL HDL s ceiling fans

1683
01:10:52,359 --> 01:11:02,319
high volume low speed ceiling fans in

1684
01:10:54,429 --> 01:11:03,939
the drive cure space sure what does the

1685
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:06,759
model tell you right if you can if you

1686
01:11:03,939 --> 01:11:08,889
can put into uh if you can put it into a

1687
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,840
room and show that look I've got good

1688
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:13,569
air velocity and good air mixing around

1689
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,828
the product great there's a question in

1690
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:16,179
here that I saw about you know how do

1691
01:11:14,828 --> 01:11:18,099
you get air mixing when you have all

1692
01:11:16,179 --> 01:11:19,469
these tight baker's trays and you know

1693
01:11:18,099 --> 01:11:21,909
hanging racks and all that other stuff

1694
01:11:19,469 --> 01:11:23,380
that's what I'd be worried about if I've

1695
01:11:21,908 --> 01:11:27,819
got air just coming from one direction

1696
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:31,538
and I'm counting on a somewhat linear

1697
01:11:27,819 --> 01:11:33,998
laminar air flow off of this off of this

1698
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:36,639
thing pushing down constantly on the

1699
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:39,130
product is there gonna make it into each

1700
01:11:36,639 --> 01:11:41,409
and every tray that I'm drying product

1701
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:43,569
on I don't know the answer that so I

1702
01:11:41,408 --> 01:11:47,288
need to see it born out show me a CFD

1703
01:11:43,569 --> 01:11:49,029
model show me something smoke test in a

1704
01:11:47,288 --> 01:11:50,800
room that tells me it works and if

1705
01:11:49,029 --> 01:11:52,029
that's the case get after it I think

1706
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,279
there might be better ways to handle

1707
01:11:52,029 --> 01:11:58,439
that though I think

1708
01:11:53,279 --> 01:12:01,288
hi I think those fans are interesting

1709
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:03,138
but there are a huge surface to clean if

1710
01:12:01,288 --> 01:12:06,750
you're not going to use some sort of

1711
01:12:03,139 --> 01:12:10,770
aerosolized cleaning solution or system

1712
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:15,448
in between your drying and curing stages

1713
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:19,440
so that's a factory keep in mind yeah I

1714
01:12:15,448 --> 01:12:21,419
got it thanks s we have some some

1715
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:25,408
questions coming in about freeze drying

1716
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:26,849
and the cryo cryogenic tearing you know

1717
01:12:25,408 --> 01:12:30,238
just to maybe you can just address a

1718
01:12:26,849 --> 01:12:33,029
little bit more your thoughts on on free

1719
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:37,500
drying cannabis versus versus a longer

1720
01:12:33,029 --> 01:12:41,609
cure sure no I think that you know it's

1721
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:44,099
a technology that you know not in its

1722
01:12:41,609 --> 01:12:47,908
infancy but it's it's still in its early

1723
01:12:44,099 --> 01:12:49,949
application stages for cannabis and you

1724
01:12:47,908 --> 01:12:52,078
know I'm lucky enough to know the guys

1725
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:53,759
over there at crack here and they've

1726
01:12:52,078 --> 01:12:56,158
been a great resource for me and just

1727
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,719
sort of understanding you know what

1728
01:12:56,158 --> 01:13:00,388
they're doing and how they're doing it

1729
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:01,649
and and the you know the obstacles and

1730
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:04,529
pinch points and how they're getting

1731
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:06,710
better I think for the most part you

1732
01:13:04,529 --> 01:13:09,269
know I really like the idea of

1733
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:12,179
processing and curing as quickly as

1734
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:14,130
possible knowing that the monoterpenes

1735
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:16,440
are going to disappear within you know

1736
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:18,719
hours and that the other terpenes and

1737
01:13:16,439 --> 01:13:21,238
secondary metabolites will you know

1738
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:24,630
basically degrade on a day-by-day basis

1739
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:26,578
so for me I'm excited about a process

1740
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:31,230
that can get us to the finish line

1741
01:13:26,578 --> 01:13:33,689
quicker while still producing a premium

1742
01:13:31,229 --> 01:13:34,888
product and I'll be honest you know like

1743
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:37,500
the products I've seen from

1744
01:13:34,889 --> 01:13:39,630
freeze-drying have incredible bag appeal

1745
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:43,649
and some of the best nose that I've ever

1746
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:45,690
experienced my question is is that the

1747
01:13:43,649 --> 01:13:47,670
quality of smoke doesn't lie just in

1748
01:13:45,689 --> 01:13:50,189
those two things it lies in the

1749
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:53,670
cleanliness of the burn it lies in the

1750
01:13:50,189 --> 01:13:56,098
test results and relies in the usability

1751
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:59,908
and that's where we're still trying to

1752
01:13:56,099 --> 01:14:02,279
refine the freeze drying process when it

1753
01:13:59,908 --> 01:14:05,279
comes to vacuum purging water in that

1754
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:06,809
environment we're just not sure if it's

1755
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:08,819
a 12-hour period or

1756
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:10,740
forty-eight hour period I'm sure if you

1757
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:12,299
give the guys at cryo here a call

1758
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:14,130
they'll actually talk to you about the

1759
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,539
options and past that they've gone down

1760
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:18,150
with exploration they have some

1761
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:20,310
incredible scientists on staff doing

1762
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:21,960
discovery and research and refinement

1763
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:24,720
but that's the idea is that we don't

1764
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,210
exactly know how long we're going to

1765
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:30,000
vacuum purge the product that's

1766
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:32,579
important because once we freeze dry we

1767
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,220
denature everything we stop the

1768
01:14:32,579 --> 01:14:38,460
degradation we stop the enzymatic

1769
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:40,770
processes things it's a hard handbrake

1770
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:43,710
so we need to make sure we're at a point

1771
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:45,720
in that vacuum purging process where the

1772
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:49,140
enzymes have broken down the other

1773
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:52,289
unwanted stuff and the hydrolysis has

1774
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:55,680
occurred to remove those products from

1775
01:14:52,289 --> 01:14:58,529
the bud that allow us to freeze-dried at

1776
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:00,780
the right moment that's one of the real

1777
01:14:58,529 --> 01:15:03,029
artistic aspects of freeze drying is

1778
01:15:00,779 --> 01:15:04,800
that making sure that the products going

1779
01:15:03,029 --> 01:15:07,009
to be clean after you freeze dried

1780
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,170
because there's no going back

1781
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:12,930
re-energized me enzymes and restarting

1782
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:15,000
that process it's great in that sense

1783
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:17,700
and it's terrifying in that sense I

1784
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,100
think there's there's applications for

1785
01:15:17,699 --> 01:15:22,470
sure for this product as the technology

1786
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,090
grows but it will take a mastery of

1787
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:27,270
understanding what's going on in that

1788
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:29,789
vacuum purging process the effects of

1789
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:33,600
pressures you know and and basically

1790
01:15:29,789 --> 01:15:36,630
really close concise monitoring this

1791
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,730
one's related to the chemistry in the

1792
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:40,470
air

1793
01:15:37,729 --> 01:15:42,179
are there any technologies to monitor

1794
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:46,199
the chemistry continuously during the

1795
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:48,470
curing process none that I know of I

1796
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:53,819
think there's some work being done on

1797
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:57,539
the visual photographic evidence based

1798
01:15:53,819 --> 01:15:59,369
curing I think that when do we get

1799
01:15:57,539 --> 01:16:01,710
further down the line with the testing

1800
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:07,890
will realize that we can use certain

1801
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:10,430
gases as a certain gases as a corollary

1802
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:13,560
to the curing process so for example

1803
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:15,720
what we monitor our co2 in a room that's

1804
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,400
for general commercial occupancy we

1805
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,899
don't actually care about the co2 level

1806
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:20,609
we're using it as a surrogate

1807
01:16:18,899 --> 01:16:22,169
to tell us how many people are inside

1808
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:24,688
the space I think there's gonna be some

1809
01:16:22,168 --> 01:16:27,059
gas we can measure as a surrogate that

1810
01:16:24,689 --> 01:16:29,249
tells us he goes this far along in the

1811
01:16:27,059 --> 01:16:30,748
curing process so I think that's

1812
01:16:29,248 --> 01:16:33,328
something to keep in mind otherwise I

1813
01:16:30,748 --> 01:16:34,800
don't really know of those you know two

1814
01:16:33,328 --> 01:16:37,768
different methods that I just mentioned

1815
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,090
a way to do that in Fitzhugh you know as

1816
01:16:37,769 --> 01:16:42,149
its as it's happening

1817
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:43,559
Jesse Jeff any ideas here I was I was

1818
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:47,489
gonna sort of take it a different vein

1819
01:16:43,559 --> 01:16:49,439
and just you know there's there's some

1820
01:16:47,488 --> 01:16:52,558
great companies out there filter comes

1821
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:53,969
to mind and and my buddy Jason over

1822
01:16:52,559 --> 01:16:55,829
there is always feeding me really good

1823
01:16:53,969 --> 01:16:57,689
information you know I always talks

1824
01:16:55,828 --> 01:17:00,359
about how we're moving forward and how

1825
01:16:57,689 --> 01:17:03,510
we you know collect information in these

1826
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:05,458
grow spaces and curing spaces and we've

1827
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:08,070
had some great conversations about how

1828
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:09,898
they're moving forward basically sampled

1829
01:17:08,069 --> 01:17:11,819
the air and the space for microbial

1830
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:13,320
contaminants I mean it takes a

1831
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:15,929
collection a petri dish and sending it

1832
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:17,009
off to lab and some interpretation but I

1833
01:17:15,929 --> 01:17:19,918
think that's an important thing to

1834
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:23,309
consider - Rob you touched on basically

1835
01:17:19,918 --> 01:17:25,828
having a mechanical nose in this space -

1836
01:17:23,309 --> 01:17:27,360
you know tell us elucidate some of the

1837
01:17:25,828 --> 01:17:29,429
pathogens as they come about I think

1838
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:32,128
this could also be a tool that could be

1839
01:17:29,429 --> 01:17:33,989
incorporated even into the shared spaces

1840
01:17:32,128 --> 01:17:36,118
of the hallways space is thinking about

1841
01:17:33,988 --> 01:17:38,488
the pressures in the curing room and

1842
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:40,378
what might be sucked into them and he's

1843
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:42,868
sort of tracking it back to where those

1844
01:17:40,378 --> 01:17:44,939
pathogens might be born or starting from

1845
01:17:42,868 --> 01:17:47,458
in the first place and also just having

1846
01:17:44,939 --> 01:17:50,070
something a system like that and in the

1847
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:52,319
space where you can sample and send it

1848
01:17:50,069 --> 01:17:54,478
off and get real about lab results it's

1849
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:55,799
not exactly the answer to the question

1850
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,689
that came up here but I think it's an

1851
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,639
interesting point we've seen some great

1852
01:17:57,689 --> 01:18:01,050
companies explore that filter like I

1853
01:17:59,639 --> 01:18:03,179
said sort of comes to mind but there's a

1854
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:04,679
handful of others out there that I've

1855
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:08,639
talked with as well pursuing some

1856
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:11,849
similar approaches I think we'll take

1857
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:15,090
the opportunity to to wrap it up here as

1858
01:18:11,849 --> 01:18:16,800
mentioned there's opportunity to reach

1859
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:19,078
out for additional questions and

1860
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,939
specific follow-ups I think we got - the

1861
01:18:19,078 --> 01:18:23,728
vast majority of those question topics

1862
01:18:20,939 --> 01:18:25,918
really want to appreciate and thank

1863
01:18:23,729 --> 01:18:27,899
everybody on the line for joining us and

1864
01:18:25,918 --> 01:18:31,198
just a quick plug for our next monthly

1865
01:18:27,899 --> 01:18:32,700
webinar that's planned for a month from

1866
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:36,059
now Thursday

1867
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:38,069
July 2nd same time stay in place we've

1868
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:40,350
been talking quite a bit about these 10

1869
01:18:38,069 --> 01:18:42,840
parameters these 10 cardinal parameters

1870
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:46,740
and you can review our first webinar

1871
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:50,310
that's available online if you if you've

1872
01:18:46,739 --> 01:18:53,219
missed that one but it's sort of this

1873
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:55,950
concept of ok great let's do it in the

1874
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:57,360
best possible way scientifically and

1875
01:18:55,949 --> 01:18:59,309
making sure that our plants are really

1876
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:02,009
going to thrive and you know on and on

1877
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:04,470
and on and on but whoa wait a second

1878
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:07,079
what does that now do to our overall

1879
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:10,110
cost of this facility both capex and

1880
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:12,149
OPEX which is such a significant factor

1881
01:19:10,109 --> 01:19:15,149
and that needs to be considered in this

1882
01:19:12,149 --> 01:19:18,059
so really excited to to sort of do a

1883
01:19:15,149 --> 01:19:20,759
deeper dive in our next one to really

1884
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:23,550
start to be able to balance cost-benefit

1885
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,900
and that relationship together it's to

1886
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,550
make sure that these decisions that are

1887
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:29,309
being made really are are the best

1888
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:30,600
possible decisions for your business and

1889
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:35,130
your business model and your

1890
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:37,910
profitability so with that really want

1891
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:39,779
to think think the guys Jesse and Rob

1892
01:19:37,909 --> 01:19:41,609
particularly for spending the time on

1893
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:43,529
this and doing this deep dive that's

1894
01:19:41,609 --> 01:19:46,439
been great and we are excited to hear

1895
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:49,349
from from the community with more and

1896
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:54,679
with that have a great day and I'll talk

1897
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:54,680
to you guys soon Thanks
