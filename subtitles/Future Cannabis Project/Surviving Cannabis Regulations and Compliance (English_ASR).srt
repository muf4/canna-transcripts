1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:06,719
and also talking about pathogens on our

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,539
cannabis plants there's also the

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:12,330
pathogens of paperwork that we're all

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,888
dealing with within this industry and

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,240
we're gonna move right into that because

6
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:21,379
that's just a really important way to

7
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:24,899
mitigate the pathogens of paperwork so

8
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:27,379
Hawley licensing and regulations and

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,428
solutions and and give us some

10
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:31,079
unbelievable tidbits and because you

11
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:33,359
weren't here last night tell us who you

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:40,159
are and and what you're what you're up

13
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:42,570
to I'm a soil water scientist with

14
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,689
training and the adaptive management of

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,890
water sheds which adaptive management

16
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:53,729
principles rely on the integration of

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:56,299
people that rely on natural resources to

18
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:58,799
protect those natural resources and

19
00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:01,679
develop sustainability within the

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,659
watersheds system I came back to

21
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,000
Humboldt County about seven years ago

22
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:08,340
after finishing my PhD to start a

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,400
consulting firm that focused on

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,790
watershed sustainability and at that

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,950
time the government was here and the

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,920
government in Northern California and

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,049
the government was really calling for

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,990
people to start registering their water

29
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,360
rights and then it just and so I started

30
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:29,250
helping my community with their water

31
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,609
rights and within that right on the

32
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:36,000
heels of that we moved into a tighter

33
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:37,618
crackdown on medical marijuana that was

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,700
being cultivated and then we moved in

35
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:43,950
very swiftly to proposition 64 which is

36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,750
the commercial cannabis regulations in

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,509
California with that there's a whole

38
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,659
suite of water board regulations that

39
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,469
cannabis farmers need to comply with and

40
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,719
California Department of Fish and

41
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:57,179
Wildlife regulations and so now for

42
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,478
about the last six and a half years I've

43
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:04,189
worked very closely with many cannabis

44
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:08,489
farmers in our community and not only

45
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:10,799
improving environmental practices but

46
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,740
also in complying with the environmental

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,730
regulations so what we see

48
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,790
here among the farms that and a yo of

49
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:24,869
the farmers that in this room are kind

50
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:27,060
of a rare practices and so you know

51
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,640
improving environmental conditions is a

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,090
gift that we have solutions that we can

53
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:35,039
really provide to our globe as a whole

54
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,890
I'm guessing the California is not

55
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,280
unique and that the way we produce

56
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:44,189
commercial agriculture is not

57
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,560
regenerative generally and when we talk

58
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:49,229
about solutions and these regulations

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,460
and regenerative farming practices I

60
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:57,349
think that really holding up the way

61
00:02:53,460 --> 00:03:00,840
that we are working with our land as a

62
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:04,439
standard for farming in general in the

63
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,420
world is the best thing that can come

64
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,689
out of one of the best things that can

65
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:13,559
come out of the regulated industry the

66
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:16,500
best thing is decriminalization in my

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,719
opinion but second to that is to change

68
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,099
the way we produce agricultural products

69
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:27,060
and the globe now in the first couple of

70
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:30,810
years I went maybe to let 500 cannabis

71
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,969
farms and I saw a lot of practices that

72
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,240
could be improved upon now I've narrowed

73
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:40,080
it down I have about 23 core farms that

74
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,530
I support in compliance needs and what

75
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,810
I'm seeing now in terms of solutions for

76
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,419
regulations like I'm physically ill

77
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,990
sitting here thinking about regulations

78
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:54,209
it's so hard it's it's destroying

79
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,900
families making people sick so what's

80
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:00,599
the solution I think the solution in

81
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,689
part is knowing the rules and we don't

82
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,609
need to know every detail but what we

83
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:09,599
have I think the regulations are a

84
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:13,530
toolkit then if we know the rules then

85
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,589
we can protect ourselves and use them as

86
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:21,839
tools as we move forward to achieve our

87
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:24,449
goals and so being able to as a business

88
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,419
owner to assess what part of the

89
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:30,439
regulation regulatory process

90
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,819
can I grapple with as a business owner

91
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:35,670
identifying that identifying how much

92
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:39,170
time and capacity we have as business

93
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,490
owners to deal with regulations and

94
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:45,420
identifying how much money we have to

95
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:48,629
spend on compliance understanding those

96
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:52,710
really helps us and will help business

97
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:55,379
owners to be compliant in a way that

98
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:58,680
needs to happen to help y'all move

99
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:01,139
forward with achieving your goals and if

100
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,750
you choose to work with a professional

101
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,990
make sure it's so much personality like

102
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:09,810
I focus extremely on environmentalism I

103
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,870
don't touch metric I have I don't care

104
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:16,560
like I'm wherever this amazing cannabis

105
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,810
goes after it's grown in a way that is

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,720
beneficial to the world I don't give a

107
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,670
fuck like that's not my thing but if

108
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,160
someone else if it's really important to

109
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,920
you to have a tight track and trade

110
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,000
system work with professionals that

111
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:35,009
their expertise serves you or no

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,040
professionals that you trust me and call

113
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:40,800
in like Daniel for example handles his

114
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,170
own compliance but when he has the

115
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,819
waterboard out there to verify his

116
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,100
non-jurisdictional water source he calls

117
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,379
me and we go out and together we like

118
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,780
high-five while the man signs off it is

119
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:55,339
non jurisdictional water source so

120
00:05:51,779 --> 00:06:01,639
knowing how to plug professionals in

121
00:05:55,339 --> 00:06:04,199
where you need them to alleviate your

122
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,629
burden of regulations I think is really

123
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,849
important it takes a lot of thought I'm

124
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:11,430
looking at I hope and glow and moon made

125
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,439
who I work with closely and all of you

126
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:17,040
do a really good job of strategizing

127
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,930
your compliance needs and really being

128
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,670
compliant where you need to be so that

129
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,060
you can operate legally and also

130
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:27,270
showcase your environmental standards

131
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:32,579
another solution to the bigger cannabis

132
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:37,879
production picture is teaching the

133
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:41,038
government how it's done right and so by

134
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:44,278
complying by opening your farms

135
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:47,218
to regulatory inspections you have the

136
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:49,288
opportunity to teach Sacramento teach

137
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:51,808
the capital teach the people that are

138
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:55,649
creating the boxes that need to be chat

139
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:57,930
teach them show them how we can work

140
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,658
with the land to produce medicine to

141
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:05,038
produce food to produce fiber to store

142
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:07,199
carbon in a way that is very ethical and

143
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,800
very kind to the environment because if

144
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,930
you drive down to Sacramento the where

145
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,879
is the capital of South California

146
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,028
you're driving through monoculture

147
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,370
almond orchards that are dripping with

148
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:24,389
poison they are killing the bees that

149
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:26,788
they're dependent on for pollination to

150
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,718
produce so we have the opportunity to

151
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:33,028
change that paradigm every day and

152
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:36,418
regulations and regulatory compliance is

153
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:38,759
that's the suit I often consider myself

154
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:40,818
a wolf in sheep's clothing when I go to

155
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:45,330
Sacramento and I'm doing my policy work

156
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:47,449
because we are having to put ourselves

157
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:52,348
in their boxes so that they can identify

158
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:54,749
with us and use even ingest the

159
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:57,209
information that education that we have

160
00:07:54,749 --> 00:08:01,050
to offer them I think that's like a

161
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:03,538
broad scope on Reggie you know

162
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,990
regulatory compliance but to sum it up

163
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:11,818
and go back know the rules enough to

164
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:14,309
allow you to pass the test to operate

165
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:16,408
legally to allow you to go about doing

166
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:20,879
your business work with professionals

167
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:23,819
that you trust when you need them and be

168
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,209
realistic about what part of the

169
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:30,778
regulatory process you want to take on

170
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:33,360
within your own business and yeah be be

171
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:36,088
really honest with yourself about time

172
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,318
and money and capacity and desire think

173
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:43,680
of a professional as like a lawyer or a

174
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:45,269
medical doctor or a tax accountant it's

175
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,689
really somebody that you're going to

176
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:51,820
hire for a very unique job and yeah be

177
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,670
be real about what that job is

178
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:59,740
talked about seeking professional advice

179
00:08:54,669 --> 00:09:02,519
and Ruby Stein Brecker you've been

180
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,560
helping people you know with this

181
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,860
pathogen of paperwork that we deal with

182
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:12,789
and and now trying to figure out how we

183
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:15,250
can better jump the hoops and also how

184
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:18,099
we can work together there's a lot of

185
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:21,250
people in this room and a lot of us have

186
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,110
the same issues that come up in the

187
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,470
regulatory system whether it's with

188
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:29,110
paperwork or if we run against some

189
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,300
troubles and and and and things are

190
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,879
coming up for us a lot of times it's

191
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:37,750
repeated and we talk about shared

192
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:40,600
counsel as well so last night Ruby you

193
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,970
were wearing your hat as madrone but

194
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,629
you're also an attorney and you also

195
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:51,340
helped many cannabis families so I'd

196
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:54,129
love for you to talk on this yeah so I

197
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:57,009
think that number one I mean a lot of

198
00:09:54,129 --> 00:10:03,269
what Holly said I wholeheartedly support

199
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:05,620
and to have an awareness of what you're

200
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,079
prepared to deal with personally what

201
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,509
you have the capacity for and what you

202
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,590
actually have the understanding of and

203
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:15,610
when you need to call in the

204
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:18,550
professionals and really and don't be

205
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:21,220
intimidated because you are you know

206
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:23,740
have such a wealth of knowledge and our

207
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,050
experts in your area and I know it's

208
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,120
sometimes a lot of times I'll talk to

209
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:30,159
people and they're very cautious or feel

210
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,049
like they sound dumb or something like

211
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,879
that and I think that if people could

212
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:36,909
let their guard down and really own

213
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:40,389
their power and be confident about who

214
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:44,469
they are and understand that attorneys

215
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:47,289
and CPAs and consultants are there to

216
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,960
provide you with a service and not to

217
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:53,049
tell you what to do and if you go in

218
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,690
with that kind of attitude it can

219
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:58,449
definitely help the dynamic in terms of

220
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,180
them really serving you and serving your

221
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,800
needs and understanding that you know a

222
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:04,870
lot of times there's folks out there

223
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,269
that will say you know you're going

224
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,460
need my ongoing help and I don't think

225
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:11,439
that's always the case and you know just

226
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,920
be cautious and take it all with a grain

227
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,260
of salt and take what you need and I

228
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:20,769
also think that there's no reason that

229
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:23,919
people cannot join together especially

230
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:26,829
in a local group of farmers or if you

231
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,719
have similar issues with just a group of

232
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,940
your friends who are farmers getting

233
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,700
problems with contracts are going to

234
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,860
market it's completely acceptable for

235
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,950
you to go to an attorney together and

236
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,800
pay for that time together and ask a

237
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,800
bunch of questions and and it's also

238
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,990
just an opportunity to pitch again this

239
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:50,649
you know joining this marketing

240
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,600
education consortium as a platform that

241
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:55,179
everybody can get behind because that

242
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,000
power in so many ways can be leveraged

243
00:11:55,179 --> 00:12:00,879
obviously but especially with seeking

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,580
professional counsel getting you know

245
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,588
time with service professionals or

246
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,500
attorneys that you might not be able to

247
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:15,040
access as individuals I think it's

248
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:17,649
really important and awesome and so when

249
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,899
you go to see counsel or seek

250
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:22,929
professional counsel in terms of an

251
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:26,439
attorney I think that one of the pivotal

252
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:28,838
times is I mean you all are way far

253
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,400
along you've already got your entities

254
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,339
formed and kind of your business

255
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,708
structure but before making a decision

256
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:37,750
about anything like that it's really

257
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:41,469
worth it to go talk to an attorney and

258
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:43,509
talk to an accountant because so many of

259
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,629
those decisions are really driven by

260
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:49,059
your finances where you are as a farm

261
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:52,059
where you're going and that can really

262
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:54,039
if you go in you know either before or

263
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:56,469
after but it's really important to do

264
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,870
those in tandem because those decisions

265
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,370
are really tied together about what kind

266
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,889
of entity you're gonna form how you're

267
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,810
gonna do your accounting how much you

268
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,370
really need to put into that and then

269
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:08,349
it's gonna help you make decisions about

270
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,480
how you're structuring your business

271
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:14,129
what kind of contracts you're entering

272
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,129
into and all of that

273
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:21,850
yeah I'm not sure what else I think that

274
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:23,500
Oh make sure that you attorneys will

275
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,050
often especially when you come in as a

276
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,730
group be very cautious about

277
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:30,429
representing multiple people and so you

278
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,500
have to waive your right to independent

279
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:34,239
counsel and that's basically just saying

280
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,399
and they'll have you sign a form that

281
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,950
make sure you understand that you're

282
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,320
getting advice as a whole from this one

283
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,149
attorney and it absolves that counsel of

284
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:53,320
any conflict of interest that may come

285
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:55,299
up later consistently having to sign

286
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,560
indemnification in the compliance

287
00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:02,189
process how can they protect themselves

288
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,629
so usually that's you know and with

289
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,339
manufacturers or distributors or anyone

290
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:08,049
that they're working for everyone wants

291
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:10,029
indemnification so one thing is that you

292
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:14,099
make sure it's a mutual indemnification

293
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:17,049
clause so that you're also protected

294
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,800
honestly like the best way to protect

295
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:23,139
yourself in that kind of situation is to

296
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,240
run a good business to be operating in

297
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:27,838
good faith I can't tell you how much it

298
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,889
matters to be able to show that you have

299
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,570
operated in good faith you've done

300
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:34,000
everything that you can to be in

301
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,700
compliance because if you end up it

302
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,708
before a you know an arbiter or a judge

303
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,910
or something like that in the situation

304
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:43,088
where you're you know having

305
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:44,980
indemnification it's coming up as you're

306
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:46,510
needing to be protected in a lawsuit it

307
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,639
goes a long way to show that you're a

308
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:50,700
good player that you've done everything

309
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,639
you can you've been an upstanding

310
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:58,629
participant in that contract and mutual

311
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:01,870
indemnification and then insurance is a

312
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:04,588
is a thing now and if you are a licensed

313
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:08,049
operator you have to have insurance and

314
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:11,140
sometimes we don't always get the

315
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:12,578
insurance but it there are certain you

316
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:15,059
know categories of occurrence that are

317
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:17,919
not as expensive as you think they are

318
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:19,000
for some product liability coverage and

319
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,129
things like that and that's really where

320
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,078
the indemnification is coming up right

321
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,000
now is really being afraid of these

322
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:27,609
lawsuits in the favor

323
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,458
crisis and all that kind of thing yeah

324
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:33,100
and also I just wanted to say that the

325
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:35,500
pure collective has several lawyers that

326
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,560
that work specifically with us so that's

327
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,870
something that we have is a resource

328
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:43,359
within this group already and can help

329
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:45,639
answer some quick questions and point

330
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,740
you in the right direction and that's a

331
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,009
way that we can collectively work

332
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,009
together
