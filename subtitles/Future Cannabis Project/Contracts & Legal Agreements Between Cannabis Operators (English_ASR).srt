2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,319
[Music]

3
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:29,140
not one wanted to write things down why

4
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:31,489
because it was a ledger of all of your

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,289
then and still from the federal

6
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:37,460
government's federally illegal activity

7
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:40,698
right it's a very sense of concern there

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,378
was a lot of I believe the person that

9
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:47,088
I'm working with and therefore a

10
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:49,338
handshake deal was enough and those days

11
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:52,030
were great and still from those

12
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:55,789
relationships you can then have

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,710
meaningful contracts and as we take

14
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:00,050
shape and start to legalize and

15
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,929
normalize and want to be a major

16
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:04,429
commodities player across the board we

17
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,799
have to look at what same and similar

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,050
industries are doing its what the most

19
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,299
important aspect is of growing your

20
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:13,459
business right and if we look at same

21
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:18,739
and similar heavily regulated industries

22
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:21,319
Pharma food alcohol tobacco they all are

23
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:24,229
heavily ensconced in both compliance and

24
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,479
most importantly contracts and its

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:29,270
contracts throughout the supply chains

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,189
so when we're looking at that we need to

27
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:34,099
make sure that at all these different

28
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:35,599
intervals as the product or as the

29
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:38,419
flower turns into product that turns

30
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,799
into where it's ultimately sold you have

31
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,159
different pivot points and different

32
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,170
concerns and different protocols that

33
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,679
you want to have in place when is the

34
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,990
best time to work on an agreement it's

35
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,750
when everybody's happy and excited to

36
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:56,509
get to the task of doing the work when

37
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,670
it's not great to discuss what terms you

38
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:01,130
want to have is when you have an issue

39
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,930
so we want to plan for the worst case

40
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:05,269
scenario under the best case

41
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:08,509
circumstances and that happens at the

42
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:10,849
outset now that being said since we have

43
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:14,209
a history of

44
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:16,310
not engaging in contractual obligations

45
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:20,390
or agreements those first conversations

46
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:24,140
will be difficult we have a good amount

47
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:27,169
of evidence to suggest why these are so

48
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:29,869
important think about the first recalls

49
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:31,909
that have been rolling out from the BCC

50
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,710
where the products needed to be recalled

51
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:35,960
because the tests came back the

52
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,900
certificate of analysis was incorrect

53
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,060
and then uploaded later to the BCC whose

54
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,830
responsibility is that is that the

55
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,960
retailer's responsibility the

56
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,270
distributor's responsibility the

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,730
manufacturers responsibility does it go

58
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,010
all the way back up to the cultivator of

59
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:54,489
the raw source material where along that

60
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:57,799
supply chain is it your responsibility

61
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,840
and does everybody along that supply

62
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,610
chain have insurance if you have not

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,370
contracted for that if there is not

64
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,610
evidence to suggest that these types of

65
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,530
claims would be covered by the insurance

66
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,330
that is along the supply chain those

67
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,949
different actors then at the end of the

68
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,930
day it's going to be everybody's

69
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:17,509
responsibility or it's going to devolve

70
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,640
into litigation in the courts which are

71
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:22,429
not favorable to cannabis claims at the

72
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:26,779
moment we want to look at a specific

73
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:30,439
example we can look at testing lab

74
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,719
agreements with distribution first and

75
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,969
foremost it is interesting of note that

76
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,159
the testing lab is the only licensed

77
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:39,439
type along the cannabis supply chain

78
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,079
that is not currently required to carry

79
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,259
insurance it is not currently required

80
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,440
to place a surety bond with the state so

81
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:52,159
when they take in your batch samples

82
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:54,579
currently according to the BCC it cannot

83
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,889
be released until the test is performed

84
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,110
therefore if that testing lab all the

85
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:01,159
sudden has too wide of a discrepancy in

86
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,040
their COAS

87
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:07,129
and the BCC says stop you can no longer

88
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:10,400
take taken product or you can no longer

89
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,719
a process certificate of analysis what

90
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,039
are you supposed to do let's say you

91
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,710
have a million dollars of product

92
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,420
waiting in a distribution warehouse

93
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,100
we'll pause for a second but just note

94
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,840
is that your distribution warehouse

95
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,370
words or a third party distribution

96
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,799
warehouse that you're now taking up

97
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,978
space

98
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,819
because a testing lab is not allowed to

99
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:32,060
continue to process your testing to

100
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:35,129
release it to go to market whose

101
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,189
responsibility is that and we're talking

102
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:42,710
about highly sensitive equipment that

103
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:45,418
may take weeks if not months to fix

104
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:46,620
where is your product if it can't be

105
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,359
released because you can't have a

106
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,340
secondary test until the first test

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,930
comes back and you can't force a

108
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,989
negative test when you're not allowed to

109
00:04:51,930 --> 00:05:08,879
issue any other test the products

110
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:10,829
sitting there according to the VCC

111
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,899
currently and this is important to note

112
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:15,329
so that if we have these 15 days of

113
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:19,408
comments and this has not been addressed

114
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:21,658
by the BCC it should be an out crying to

115
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:23,968
the regulator's that this cannot stand

116
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:26,218
because this is an issue that really in

117
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:28,168
the real world can happen so to

118
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:31,468
paraphrase you give it to lab a it's

119
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:33,538
stuck at lab a until lab a can clear

120
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:35,759
that now when you look at it from the

121
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:38,579
regulator's point of view they want to

122
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,800
prevent lab shopping right they want to

123
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:43,288
prevent the fact that you could go to a

124
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,400
different lab until you pass muster

125
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:49,079
however if the BCC is the one that shuts

126
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,679
them down because they can't issue the

127
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,689
test

128
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,728
there should be two bifurcated scales

129
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:56,339
there should be the ability to take

130
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,750
those samples and under custody a chain

131
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:59,698
of control either send them to a

132
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,269
different lab that's owned by the same

133
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:05,430
lab a so lab a one if they have multiple

134
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:07,769
labs throughout the state or to a

135
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,620
separate lab entirely or to cancel the

136
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:13,139
test entirely take new batch samples and

137
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,990
whose responsibility is the batch sample

138
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,389
is it going to be that lab a that

139
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,218
couldn't fulfill their obligations or is

140
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,259
it the cultivator that's now responsible

141
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:24,240
for a second set of badge tests if you

142
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,419
don't have an agreement I can promise

143
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,278
you that lab a is gonna walk away saying

144
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:32,639
this is no longer my issue

145
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:36,389
so tell me what you would be counseling

146
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:40,739
a cultivator in Santa Cruz or Monterey

147
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:42,598
County - what clause clauses would you

148
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:44,338
have them put the contract with what

149
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:46,709
other party with a lab with a

150
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:48,569
distributor with whoever I need to have

151
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,309
it with your distributor if you're not

152
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:52,199
self you know if you don't have your own

153
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:55,229
distribution vertically integrated

154
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,119
business or if you're a cultivator

155
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:58,378
that's just moving product up along the

156
00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:00,749
supply chain you're going to want to

157
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,189
have in-house R&amp;D we'll talk about why

158
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:04,379
that's so important to have that

159
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:06,449
baseline test if you're moving product

160
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,949
throughout the supply chain but in this

161
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,449
particular instance you're going to want

162
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:12,088
to make sure that your distributor has

163
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,999
an agreement with the testing lab a for

164
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:17,038
intervals of time and what those look

165
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:19,349
like so that you can clear a product and

166
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,058
that testing lab and that distributor

167
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:22,168
have an agreement that in an instance

168
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:24,838
that they cannot fulfill their

169
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:27,139
obligations whose responsibility is it

170
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:29,728
and what remediation there can be

171
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,348
especially in light of knowing what

172
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:33,748
these current issues are with the way

173
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:37,319
that the BCC is interpreting their

174
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:38,999
regulations and to go back to if you're

175
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,408
a cultivator and you're just moving

176
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:43,169
product throughout the supply chain

177
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:45,269
between a cultivator and a manufacturer

178
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:47,188
and you don't have to use then a

179
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:50,338
distributor technically there's no qa/qc

180
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:52,289
that's required you need to think about

181
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:55,288
what happens if I use a transport

182
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:57,329
distribution only licensee that licensee

183
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:59,818
is not allowed to take custody and

184
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:02,038
control of the product that means that

185
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,919
at some point either the manufacturer

186
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:06,988
has to carry the responsibility all the

187
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,088
way through to it gets to the

188
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:11,098
manufacturer or the manufacturer takes

189
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:13,048
over responsibility at the time that it

190
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:15,329
gets picked up from the cultivator and

191
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:17,488
arrives at the manufacturing facility

192
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,439
because that middleman that transport

193
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:21,418
only licensee is now invested with the

194
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,459
right to take on the custody of their

195
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:27,178
responsibility that means if you don't

196
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:29,129
test the product when it's flour what if

197
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:31,768
it gets into the distribution transport

198
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:34,680
only cargo area and it gets contaminated

199
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:36,000
and then it gets to the manufacturer the

200
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,559
manufacturer turns it into a

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,408
manufactured good

202
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,000
whatever that contaminant is

203
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:48,220
concentrates together and all the sudden

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,409
tests dirty where who is responsible and

205
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,330
if there's no evidence if there's no

206
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:54,458
issuance of a certificate that says this

207
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,830
was tested it was clean it was put into

208
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,809
here that was my responsibility there's

209
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:02,170
coverage there's insurance that insures

210
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:03,819
me to get the product to manufacture to

211
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:06,699
the manufacturer and then the

212
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,860
manufacturers liability sets in and I'm

213
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,410
absolved of liability as the cultivator

214
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,889
and if you don't have these things

215
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:17,079
buttoned up there's no way to know and

216
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:19,539
then you're in he said she said issue

217
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,950
you're going to court the courts can ask

218
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:24,399
do you have an agreement you're gonna

219
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,930
have a purchase order purchase order

220
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,528
isn't going to go into the devil of the

221
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:31,539
details of why the the recall procedures

222
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:34,269
are what the remediation procedures are

223
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:36,490
way whose responsibility was it at what

224
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,870
point in time at the supply chain these

225
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,330
are all things that really need to be

226
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,299
discussed and are going to be unique

227
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,850
between the parties so you can generate

228
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:47,679
a suite of template of agreements which

229
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,870
is what I'm hoping that we'll see as an

230
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,699
industry there's practice and pleading

231
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,919
agreements all over the place and other

232
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,140
same or similar industries that we can

233
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:00,309
borrow from Terms of Service disclaimers

234
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:02,799
all of that and as we work through that

235
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:05,169
you'll be able to then just start to

236
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,240
tinker with the it with the specific

237
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:12,599
terms that have to deal with your

238
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,600
specific transaction between two parties

239
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,289
party a and party these insurance

240
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,230
carrier as well because if you don't

241
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:24,819
have a closet says who's liable both

242
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,259
insurance like the insurance companies

243
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,790
are all about not paint out right so

244
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:30,850
they're gonna be like well it doesn't

245
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:33,549
say that you're liable so why do I need

246
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,220
to pay out so can you sort of say that

247
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,839
this also sort of dominoes into your

248
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,509
each respective parties insurance

249
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,340
carriers and claims and things like yeah

250
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:44,439
you're gonna want to have as an

251
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,080
attachment to these documents the

252
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,030
insurance carriers making sure that the

253
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,650
insurance is going to cover these types

254
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:52,480
of risks and making sure they know that

255
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,970
you're transporting cannabis I know that

256
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,000
seems weird in today's world but we're

257
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,889
still seeing people not exactly be on

258
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,259
the up-and-up we're a wellness company

259
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:06,039
you're a cannabis company you're gonna

260
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:07,750
wanna have is an exhibit there I'm state

261
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,909
and local licensing and what those

262
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,340
requirements are so that you're not as

263
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:13,959
the end consumer is the end retailer

264
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,090
taking in product that you can actually

265
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,220
sell because he'll license was expired

266
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,350
so there's all of these things that you

267
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,810
need to be aware of and they can be

268
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,730
documented through this agreement

269
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:27,219
process right we have to have child

270
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:30,190
resistant packaging that meets the year

271
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:34,629
and the poison Prevention Act of 1970

272
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:37,000
when you are procuring packaged material

273
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:38,500
right when you're the the actual package

274
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,009
that you're going to put the product in

275
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,019
does that company certify does it have

276
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:46,240
some sort of certification that they can

277
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:48,699
provide you with that would go into that

278
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,919
agreement that says all of the packaging

279
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,870
is child resistant and meets the

280
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,490
nineteen seventy poison Prevention Act

281
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,889
so that if somebody calls you out on it

282
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,930
you can say nope I've contracted for I

283
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:01,120
looked at and if there is an issue where

284
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,279
it does not meet that requirement you

285
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,980
have that company on the hook they've

286
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,449
made that agreement that promise with

287
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,339
you that you can take to court

288

even manufacturing the manufacturer the

290

brand and you the packaging supplier

291
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:21,049
yeah so you're gonna want as the

292
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:23,028
manufacturing entity when you enter into

293
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:26,328
an agreement with the packing source

China or somewhere domestically that

296
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:34,458
they understand what your needs are what

297
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:37,028
your requirements are that it must be

298
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:40,008
child resistant and it must meet this

299
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:42,078
1970 poison Prevention Act and there are

300
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,879
certifications you are actually supposed

301
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:48,429
to have that certification readily

302
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,430

you know one when they're dealing with

00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:10,859
retailers too when they're dealing with

307
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,278
yeah distributors in that instance who

308
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,259
are looking for a final form product

309

right unless you are the same

00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:21,500
distributor that also holds a

311

final floor product you're taking it in

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:32,959
um they're gonna look for the testing

314
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:34,638
you know they're gonna distributors with

315

manufacturers they're basically looking

316

at terms of service when you're looking

317
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:42,078
at recall procedures what that's gonna

318
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,909
look like right if the product has to be

319
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:46,399
recalled because there's some issue that

320
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:48,078
they've now taken in and it either is

321
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,899
discovered through testing that there's

322
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,819
a problem or there's a leakage in you

323
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,409
know the cart that all of a sudden

324
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,449
they're gonna have to recall it up do

325
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:58,448
you have mechanisms in place for that

326
00:13:56,448 --> 00:14:01,039
what are the time frames what are the

327
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:03,889
responsibilities who's going to have to

328

deal with that a distributor is really

329
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:07,669
specifically going to want to know how

330
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:09,828
they're going to engage with the

331

00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,419
retailer you're really gonna want to box

335
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:22,759
out again how that distributor is going

336
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:24,860
to deal with that same situation in a

337
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,480
recall right are they going to have the

338
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,120
back stock how quickly are they going to

339
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,629
be able to get it to you why under what

340
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,179
circumstances is a recall trigger and

341
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:37,278
for them they're gonna want to look at

342
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:39,679
from a retailer's point of view making

343
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,778
sure that that distributor has good

344
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,599
testing agreements in place in order to

345
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:48,409
fulfill orders since we're looking to

346
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,230
likely have a secondary level extinction

347
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:53,208
event with bare-bones products on the

348
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,329
shelves when phase three testing comes

349
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:59,328
in um making sure that the labs of which

350
00:14:56,328 --> 00:15:01,789
we know there may be one to two that are

351
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:03,379
currently going to be ready are you

352
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:05,480
dealing with one of the distributors

353
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:08,828
that has access to one of the labs that

354
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,829
may be able to do that

355
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,899
that snare the retailer would say we'd

356
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,879
like to carry products that you're

357
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:18,309
distributing but can you show us which

358
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,889
lab you're working with so we can have

359
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:23,638
comfort they can ask for that when

360
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:26,649
you're doing contract negotiations the

361
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,810
the door is wide open for you to ask

362
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:30,970
these critical questions right at the

363
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:32,739
time that they become issues you're not

364
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,600
asking questions you're demanding

365
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,698
answers you're demanding action and

366
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,610
wouldn't it be better wouldn't you feel

367
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:42,039
more comfortable as you're marching ever

368
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,230
closer to the first of the year in the

369
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,360
onboarding of metric and the onboarding

370
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,730
of Phase three testing and any new

371
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,120
requirements that come out that you have

372
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:55,688
a course of action if things go south

373
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,110
if the inevitable occurs if a CoA comes

374
00:15:55,688 --> 00:16:01,958
back dirty if there is product lost in

375
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:05,169
transit if there is CHP pulled you over

376
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:08,888
and then it takes in an entire shipment

377
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:10,750
of product and puts it in to a detention

378
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:13,180
facility that isn't in the humid

379
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,919
controlled and potentially loses an

380
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:19,628
entire crop of product whose

381
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,549
responsibility it had happened it will

382
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:26,079
continue to happen while we have this

383
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:28,028
federal overlay of illegalities these

384
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:31,149
issues are still going to happen and if

385
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:33,188
you're not talking about them now you're

386
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:35,620
likely causing yourself harm in the

387
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:38,349
future these are tough conversations I'm

388
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,120
not sitting here saying they're easy I'm

389
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,209
not sitting here saying that every

390
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,578
operator is ready willing and excited to

391
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:48,849
engage in this process it's expensive

392
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:51,308
it's arduous it's continually shifting

393
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,209
but if you're not investing in yourself

394
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:57,308
and your business and putting in place

395
00:16:54,208 --> 00:17:00,188
practices and their agreements that deal

396
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:02,769
with these complex issues when they

397
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:05,168
become issues nobody's in the best

398
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:06,970
headspace to address them they're

399
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,309
scrambling to survive their own

400
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,259
livelihood they're scrambling to make

401
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:13,178
sure that the people that they took the

402
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:15,170
product from if it's a distributor

403
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:17,810
they're able to pay

404
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,670
when those trigger points for payment

405
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:22,309
are done and they're different for

406
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:24,709
everyone along the supply chain right a

407
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:26,240
distributor is going to want to do Co D

408
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,650
care on delivery they're gonna want to

409
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,430
make sure that they collect that excise

410
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,870
tax right up front if I'm representing a

411
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,330
retailer I may not want to pay that

412
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:37,459
excise tax right up front so it's

413
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:40,549
important to also have your own

414
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,079
representation right the time has come

415
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:45,049
where people are gonna start to need

416
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,419
general counsel in house that there's

417
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:50,000
all of these things in flux note in the

418
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,700
BCC regulations it says every contract

419
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,349
you have should be on file at your

420
00:17:52,700 --> 00:18:00,220
facility they're anticipating you having

421
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:03,589
contracts by that sheer statement alone

422
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:08,690
so the the times of a handshake deal are

423
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:12,019
over it's time to embrace having

424
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,970
contracts and learning what needs to be

425
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:16,339
in them and working collaboratively

426
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,980
together at the beginning that'll be

427
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:21,289
easier the more finite these contracts

428
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,299
get the power players are going to be in

429
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:26,210
a position to push the contract terms

430
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:31,029
that they want so if we're in a scenario

431
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:33,769
where the market customers are

432
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:37,430
experiencing a defect in the product

433
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:39,500
there is leakage in the vape car right

434
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:41,509
and it's systemic so people are coming

435
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,900
in to all of the different retailers

436
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:46,490
across let's say the state really right

437
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,040
because we have statewide distributions

438
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:52,160
and that's what every manufacturer brand

439
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,990
is after so you've got statewide

440
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,120
distribution you've got a leaky vape

441
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:59,150
cart people are coming into the

442
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:01,939
dispensaries in droves angry saying my

443
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,310
product is defective they're calling the

444
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,080
BCC with their you know enforcement line

445
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,899
and there's something that needs to be

446
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:12,009
done correct okay so we've got this

447
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:16,130
scenario in a in a contract list

448
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:18,890
environment and let's say there's

449
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,320
potential harm in the leakage right

450
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,820
it's contaminating with the filament in

451
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:25,819
the vape card it could potentially harm

452
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:27,439
somebody now you're looking at somebody

453
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:28,309
who's looking to sue over products

454
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,850
liability

455
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:34,009
and the more normalized we get the more

456
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:35,419
products liability you get at the second

457
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,160
that you can get into federal court

458
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,210
where there are treble damages in this

459
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,730
area and negligence starts to apply

460
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,950
that's a whole nother bag of worms but

461
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,740
so if you have no contract that one

462
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:52,009
person or that class actions of persons

463
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,920
can go after everybody along that supply

464
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:58,400
chain because everybody had a hand in

465
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,370
that product getting to where it is so

466
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,630
you want to build in indemnification and

467
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:06,979
places where you the operator depending

468
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,470
along where you are in the supply chain

469
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,680
says I'm no longer responsible or

470
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,539
somebody else is responsible so you

471
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,490
backtrack it right if you're a retailer

472
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:18,920
and you're dealing with a distributor

473
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,750
what are the recall procedures I noticed

474
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,210
that this is happening then there is a

475
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:26,029
recall out people are bringing in the

476
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,279
product I have to destroy that product

477
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:31,460
in accordance with my waste management

478
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:33,619
procedures it's a cost so where does not

479
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,090
cost to come from am i assessing not to

480
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:37,069
the distributor because that's what's in

481
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:38,809
my agreement and the distributor should

482
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,819
have an agreement with the manufacturer

483
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:42,349
and in that instance the distributor

484
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,970
goes to the manufacturer and says you

485
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:45,709
have to cover this cost and we have to

486
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,569
get product to these shelves or you no

487
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,549
longer gonna have that shelf space right

488
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:52,039
this is a systemic issue and then the

489
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:54,859
manufacturer goes back to who they

490
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:57,680
purchase that may part from before they

491
00:20:54,859 --> 00:21:00,829
put the oil in it and they say this is

492
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,230
not what I contract for this is a major

493
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:05,240
defect this is a fundamental flaw in

494
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:08,650
this product and you have now caused a

495
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,650
series of chain reactions

496
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:15,019
so you're responsible liable and you

497
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:17,960
need to cover that cost so you can see

498
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:20,359
if there are specific provisions along

499
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,450
that supply chain you'll know what to do

500
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:25,369
from your vertical and then the next

501
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,720
vertical will be their responsibility so

502
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:29,029
the distributor may be in a situation

503
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,559
where they have to pay out and then they

504
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:32,000
go to the manufacturer to get their

505
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,980
payment the manufacturer goes to

506
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,200
somebody else now there may be lawsuits

507
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,519
anywhere along that continuum but

508
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,160
wherever you are

509
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,379
retailer to distributor distributor to

510
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:46,390
manufacturer manufacturer to supplier of

511
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:50,210
the the cart itself of the device

512
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:52,280
those are insulated agreements so you're

513
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:55,039
protecting where you are along that

514
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:59,319
supply chain being cognizant that the

515
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,319
person before you may not have done

516
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:09,109
that's exactly a hot potato liability is

517
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:11,779
genuinely how the law works right we're

518
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:15,079
along that supply chain is there

519
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:16,940
protection and where is my liability cut

520
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:22,159
off by an intervening cause of somebody

521
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:24,650
else oh you know that will happen I mean

522
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:29,420
it happened with lols when they took

523
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:31,610
about laws was a testing issues well the

524
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:35,019
COA changed after 48 hours so the

525
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:38,209
testing lab in that instance I believe

526
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:40,579
reissued the CoA which went to the BCC

527
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:42,529
if they were acting as their own

528
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:45,049
distributor which I believe in that

529
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:47,029
instance they were I can't say for

530
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:50,869
certain but if you were your own

531
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:54,889
distributor and you had a cultivation

532
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:57,289
license and you were doing pre rolls and

533
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,300
the tests came back you would want to

534
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:01,190
have a provision that puts that testing

535
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:04,269
lab on the hook that if they change

536
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:08,029
their their mind if they change that CoA

537
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:09,619
after 24 hours after issuance really

538
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:11,960
after the point at which it goes to the

539
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:13,939
BCC and that product has been cleared to

540
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,039
market that they then would be

541
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,700
responsible for any of the monetary

542
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:23,659
costs associated with a change in the

543
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:26,509
CoA so the issue there was you approved

544
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:30,279
it we then released it to dispensaries

545
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:33,119
up and down the state had you dinged us

546
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:39,779
at that initial point we would not have

547
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:42,909
put in a hundred dispensaries right had

548
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:46,210
reputational issues had issues that were

549
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:49,330
monetarily where those retailers may not

550
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,990
use you again you lost market share it's

551
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:52,929
bad

552
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:55,839
from a public optics perspective these

553
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:58,150
issues are much larger than the that

554
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,730
very small issue to begin with

555
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:03,070
right they balloon out and in a space

556
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:06,250
where we have pure saturation of new

557
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:10,839
products and new brands coming in every

558
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:12,910
day a recall of that sort of magnitude

559
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:15,789
or the inability to get your product to

560
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,860
market because it is held back waiting

561
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:21,279
for a testing lab that's been put on ice

562
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:24,909
by the BCC for some issue with their

563
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,589
technical equipment you could lose that

564
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:30,310
market share without really the ability

565
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:32,859
to gain it back so we're not talking

566
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:35,349
about small things we're talking about

567
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:37,959
the arrows that could take out your

568
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:40,869
business and we're asking you to put

569
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,390
words down on paper that articulate

570
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:47,559
responsibility I think if you peel back

571
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:49,540
this idea that the lawyers are trying to

572
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:52,589
get in and they're trying to make more

573
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:56,170
money during this tumultuous you know

574
00:24:52,589 --> 00:25:00,519
wave of regulation they're not we're

575
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:03,250
putting contractual terms on paper that

576
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:05,200
ensure that all the parties are doing

577
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:08,680
what they said they were going to do and

578
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:12,730
if you strip it away to that bare basic

579
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:14,650
necessity it's just taking the terms and

580
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,630
the agreements that you've said that you

581
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,090
would do and putting them down on

582
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:21,790
writing we can look no further than back

583
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:24,250
to July one where retailers were left

584
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:25,690
holding the bag with manufactured

585
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,509
product that didn't meet the

586
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:31,499
requirements on July 1 that weren't

587
00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:35,259
switched out as they were prom

588
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:38,470
with no recourse not was because nobody

589
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:41,589
put down the I promise I will come on

590
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,389
the 29th or the 30th or the 31st and

591
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:45,939
change out that product into an

592
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:47,319
agreement that was signed executed in

593
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,940
writing that you could take deport

594
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:50,939
hurray for agreement

595
00:25:52,529 --> 00:26:08,078
