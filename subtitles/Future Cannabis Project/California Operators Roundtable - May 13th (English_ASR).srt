1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,219
I'd love to just start by going down the

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:08,580
line actually you guys change order in

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:11,189
my view but starting with she kind of

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,089
who is who in your mind is your target

5
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:16,710
demographic and what's the main product

6
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,010
you sell to them and what are the trends

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:25,949
you're seeing in terms of growth decline

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:27,960
and whatnot good morning well I am a

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,240
cannabis farmer up here in Northern

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,380
California Mendocino County and

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:37,049
primarily my farm just produces top

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,260
shelf flour from my own brand for other

13
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:42,149
brands and so that's my my priority so

14
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,759
flour consumers would be my number one

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,160
target audience at this moment obviously

16
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,159
I do sell my biomass and my shake to

17
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,069
companies manufacturers who turn that

18
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,099
into various things but my primary

19
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,140
concern is having my flour sold yeah

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,230
what what what percentage of your

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,558
harvest goes to or I guess you said your

22
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:08,368
shake but so all the flour you keep for

23
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:11,158
your own brand sales and then what how

24
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:16,200
much shake is going out for white label

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:18,750
I just did a calculation for last year's

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:25,109
harvest and we had about thirty percent

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:28,560
of our income was from shake from last

28
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:30,420
year so you know it's a significant

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,129
portion it's kind of interesting to see

30
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:39,390
in the end of 2019 and this so far in

31
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:42,298
2020 the shake sales shake buyers have

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,540
gone way down I'm not getting thousands

33
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,680
of inquiries every day from shake buyers

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,350
like I was in 2018 20 beginning of 2019

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,530
I basically paid my bills by selling

36
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:57,629
shake like really I could have just

37
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,728
turned my flower into shake and sold it

38
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:02,819
faster than I could have sold flour back

39
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:05,009
then so you know the times have turned I

40
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,169
now I'm getting calls multiple

41
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,169
voicemails every day from some random

42
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,930
guy who works from some random company

43
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:16,179
looking for flour so you know

44
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,459
looking for flower to white label or

45
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,069
flower with men or are canta flowers

46
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:23,590
brand on it yeah well so just to be

47
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:25,839
clear I operate Mendocino generations

48
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,549
which is a group of fifty farms a lot of

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,769
those farms have their own brands most

50
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:35,620
of those farms sell their flower to

51
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:39,040
other brands and me personally I sell my

52
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,468
flower probably 75% of my flower goes to

53
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,979
other companies who put it in their own

54
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:47,259
branding and then the other portion of

55
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:51,848
my flower goes into my brand which is

56
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:54,280
called Arkana flowers so yeah there

57
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:57,098
they're putting it into probably some

58
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,348
portion of pre-rolls top shelf pre rolls

59
00:02:57,098 --> 00:03:02,709
that are made you know exclusively from

60
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:05,899
flower as well as putting it in their

61
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:11,360
branded jars and such

62
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:13,000
got it Chelsea who's your target

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,880
audience

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:24,318
who's your archetype my my demographic

65
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:26,870
is definitely boomers it's interesting

66
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,359
because that it's it kind of derived

67
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,110
naturally out of how kind of my whole

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,390
company brand started my first product

69
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:40,280
was just something I made for my grandma

70
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:41,988
it kind of got this award and all of a

71
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,610
sudden the public knew about it and I

72
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:48,799
had to create the business at that point

73
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,630
so like I was saying the first product

74
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,060
being specifically designed for my

75
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:56,840
grandma who is you know a Jehovah's

76
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,759
Witness very not cannabis friendly

77
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:05,780
especially just given her age her

78
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:07,699
background and so that that naturally

79
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:13,789
derived kind of who my target audience

80
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:15,679
would be and like right after we won our

81
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:18,288
first emerald cup I remember the

82
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,160
Sacramento Bee did a write-up about us

83
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:25,909
and you know like it was in the print

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,000
version buried in the pages tiny little

85
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,740
font and yet you know 200 boomers

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,740
probably busted out a magnifying glass

87
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:39,168
to read my email address and just blew

88
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:41,689
me up and so that's kind of how we got

89
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:43,069
started just serving our local

90
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:51,050
Sacramento community

91
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:52,550
and taking it from there but the way it

92
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,639
links up to what we're doing now with

93
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,439
the delivery service is that those 200

94
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,030
original customers which you know we're

95
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,910
all older people all people with pain

96
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:05,888
all people who were in the process of

97
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,889
getting picked off their opiate regimens

98
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:12,110
they they're kind of the customer Bates

99
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:14,658
that I still have a deep loyalty to so

100
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,330
when kovat happened and it became really

101
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:19,659
unclear if people would be able to still

102
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:23,000
have access especially being an older

103
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,949
generation more vulnerable like maybe

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,060
even going out to do curbside isn't an

105
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:31,069
option I knew that I had to like quickly

106
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,379
get a delivery on board and to start

107
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:37,279
making sure that they could get safe

108
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:39,939
deliveries at their homes so the

109
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,989
delivery service I partnered with offers

110
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:44,209
contactless delivery they got it

111
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:48,470
approved through the BCC you know

112
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:50,810
emergency regulation style and so we're

113
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,900
able to they're able to go to my website

114
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:56,418
but they're familiar with by my products

115
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:59,870
and another other selected products

116
00:05:56,418 --> 00:06:04,029
curated and get that delivered to their

117
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:08,030
home with no contact with the driver and

118
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:09,469
that's that's how we're working at HLC

119
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:12,259
we were talking yesterday about

120
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,300
compassion programs as well in

121
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,550
California is that a part of what you

122
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,478
are you able to utilize that and save

123
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:23,598
some tax money and that type of stuff um

124
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:27,829
so what I do is if I hover have any

125
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:31,209
inventory that's getting you know within

126
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:34,519
four months or so of its CoA is

127
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:36,859
expiration and they I just shipped all

128
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:40,848
of that inventory over to compassion

129
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,840
programs and so we're in the process of

130
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:44,180
doing that right now we're gonna

131
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,219
probably be putting out about like 300

132
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:52,189
units of the deep skin into various

133
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:55,030
compassion programs around the state are

134
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:57,978
you seeing that there's a need I'm sorry

135
00:06:55,029 --> 00:07:00,469
can you elaborate on the mechanics of

136
00:06:57,978 --> 00:07:04,159
because compassion is recently back

137
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:06,340
right so can you explain like when you

138
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,240
say we're gonna give it like

139
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:12,909
whoo-hoo-hoo are you giving it to is a

140
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,848
profit

141
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:20,000
no no just just normal retailers as long

142
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:23,418
as they are prepared to deal with you

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,620
know the meticulous of properly

144
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:30,168
documenting these transactions they can

145
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,759
do it and they don't have to pay taxes

146
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:33,259
and you don't have to pay taxes and the

147
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,000
the patient doesn't have to

148
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:39,170
pay taxes or what's the taxes I I don't

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,480
I'm not an expert

150
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:44,870
I have someone who figures that part out

151
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,280
for me I'm just trying to get people

152
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,800
taken care of

153
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:54,349
I like it given away product Julie I'm

154
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,350
pretty sure that that was recently

155
00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:00,379
amended correct you don't have to pay

156
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:06,110
taxes on compassion products I can speak

157
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:09,110
to a little bit if you want to so we had

158
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,960
some product that had expired the

159
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,939
testing you know the test expired and

160
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,310
last July and we were not sure what to

161
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:20,540
do with this stuff and at that time I

162
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:24,110
was in contact with with a a man who's

163
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:28,819
called sweetleaf Joe and right and he's

164
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:31,910
been calling everybody really and so so

165
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,979
I had like started down this pathway of

166
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:39,889
trying to figure out how to is about six

167
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:41,690
pounds of flour and the tax rate is was

168
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:45,769
at that point one hundred and forty

169
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:49,250
eight dollars per pound right so in

170
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:52,639
order for me to donate that six pounds I

171
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:57,139
have to pay over eight hundred something

172
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:59,929
dollars in order to donate it it cannot

173
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:03,199
be donated unless I pay that tax and

174
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:06,399
I've already lost six times whatever the

175
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,740
pound price could have been plus

176
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:14,539
trimming it packaging it labeling it

177
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:17,570
testing it etc so now I'm out somewhere

178
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:20,299
around eight grand just to try to donate

179
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,129
some flour and personally as a farm like

180
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:23,870
I can't really do it and I don't know

181
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,429
what to do with it but either way I have

182
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:29,480
to pay for it I have to pay for it to

183
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:32,419
get destroyed or I have to pay for it to

184
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,210
get donated kind of a tough one have you

185
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:38,750
tried making any donations recently yeah

186
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:40,730
so this is still in the process so I'm

187
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,460
not totally sure what's going to happen

188
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,659
I were still kind of all figuring it out

189
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,769
cuz that's what I was under the

190
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,169
impression of the beginning that it was

191
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:48,059
like

192
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:51,740
oh we're gonna donate this and it's like

193
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:55,259
we get to write it off well not really

194
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,879
so well we'll see I I think over the

195
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:03,509
next like month or so I shouldn't have

196
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:07,409
an answer about that okay Mike do you

197
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:10,490
wanna talk about your your target

198
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:13,769
demographic with your solvent list hash

199
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:20,278
got a better more than more than happy

200
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:22,110
to so both of our brands are are

201
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:24,208
targeting the market at large we don't

202
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,459
wanna you know pigeonhole ourselves at

203
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:29,609
all we definitely are interested in the

204
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,989
over 65 the boomers we're really keen on

205
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,539
them I loved what you were saying

206
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,899
Chelsea I love your brand where you're

207
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:39,778
going I was so awesome the passion is

208
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:42,539
obviously there and your trajectory is

209
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:44,458
noble so you know those things are hard

210
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:47,189
to come by now in marijuana business so

211
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,319
it's awesome to hear and see that yeah

212
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,149
Kalli hash is definitely it's a it's a

213
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,129
solvent less hash brand it's geared for

214
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:55,379
the market at large

215
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:56,730
we're definitely keen on you know the

216
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,578
older people the younger people

217
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:03,269
all the people more importantly our new

218
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:05,328
brand hash hash lab line of products is

219
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:10,169
gonna be all solvent less based

220
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:12,929
therapeutic holistic non combustible

221
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:16,588
products where I think tinctures mostly

222
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:18,989
right features sublinguals topicals all

223
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:20,610
of those things but nothing combustible

224
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,289
so nothing you're gonna be smoking so

225
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,539
really gearing towards the medicinal

226
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:26,429
side of that of the industry and really

227
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:28,620
making a stark contrast between a

228
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:30,448
lifestyle brand and a medicinal brand

229
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,948
and what those two things are and why

230
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:35,698
they're different and they're very

231
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:38,519
different and you know as we evolved as

232
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:42,028
an industry the medicinal side is only

233
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,039
gonna grow in importance and volume and

234
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:44,939
all of those things Tamara I wanted to

235
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,259
ask you a quick question

236
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,060
now that I have you I love your company

237
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:52,769
by the way fucking amazing very

238
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:55,169
expensive but very amazing we are you

239
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,779
work you mentioned that the the volume

240
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:59,169
is growing in

241
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:02,990
in some of the smaller purchasing

242
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:03,919
products I phrase that the lower

243
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,070
pricepoint

244
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:10,129
thank you is that the race to the bottom

245
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:15,320
of the weed competition that's currently

246
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:16,820
happening or no actually in the street

247
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,860
there's a real feeling that there's a

248
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,870
real race to the bottom when it comes to

249
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,909
the flower brands just heading it out I

250
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,190
did it's all about who's got the most

251
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:29,059
money to withstand the most time and and

252
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:31,430
in total me it's so holy I want to get

253
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:32,359
your take on that so so it's funny it's

254
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:35,809
funny that you say that because actually

255
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:39,710
I do agree that right now one of the

256
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:42,679
biggest indicators of six success is

257
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:45,290
less on the demand side and more on the

258
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,329
supply side like who can just get

259
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:49,969
product to dispensary shelves better

260
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:52,550
than anyone else in the you're

261
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,259
definitely seeing within the flower

262
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:57,199
category so what I was pointing out in

263
00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:00,110
the slides was specifically around the

264
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,140
surge days right the the days where

265
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:06,470
people were stalking off that's when you

266
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:08,480
saw a surge right along with those surge

267
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,090
days in the lower price point products

268
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,690
the under $20 products right which

269
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:17,690
indicates that people were we're

270
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,980
stocking up right on they wanted they

271
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,100
wanted more to stock up on right they

272
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:24,139
wanted more more in their back pocket at

273
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,570
home right in case you know they ran out

274
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,970
right um also anticipating for

275
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,620
potentially larger or you know more

276
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,350
consumption which I as I mentioned

277
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,590
earlier was definitely the case with me

278
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:39,710
overall not within those specific search

279
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:42,259
days but overall we're definitely seeing

280
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,850
more of a race to the bottom and I

281
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:46,850
wouldn't quite yet call it a race to the

282
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:49,129
bottom it's not Oregon right or where

283
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,750
Colorado is out either you know I think

284
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:53,000
California on the flower site still has

285
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,339
the you know second ice price point out

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,700
of all adult use markets okay Nevada

287
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,290
being higher but but you're definitely

288
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,820
seeing more value brands coming to

289
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:04,309
market right I mean Condesa and just

290
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,100
launched Baker's and you know we've seen

291
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:09,279
an old pal obviously taking a lot of

292
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,279
share

293
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:15,490
within the manufactured goods I don't

294
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,580
think that you're seeing you're not

295
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:21,610
seeing such a race to the bottom and so

296
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,230
we're not quite there yet but what what

297
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,940
is interesting within cannabis is right

298
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,889
now a lot of the pricing isn't so much

299
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,180
consumer driven in fact a lot of what's

300
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:30,759
happening at retail isn't really

301
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:32,229
consumer driven um you know we're not

302
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,850
really at a point yet where consumers

303
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,399
are walking in a dispensary saying I

304
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,779
want Kiba blueberries and then the

305
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,220
dispensary says I don't have cuba

306
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,709
blueberries and the consumer turns on

307
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,019
and walks out right right now a lot of

308
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,879
what's moving at retail is primarily

309
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:47,919
driven by the supply side and what you

310
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:49,689
said right it seems like so much of

311
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,129
what's moving is just dependent on who's

312
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,910
got the money to put it on the shelves

313
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:56,500
and you know what 100% I mean not not

314
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:58,419
that consumers don't really have an

315
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,850
influence right now they do but we're

316
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:02,529
not fully there yet you know we still

317
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,590
have a lot of brand development to do as

318
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:09,669
an industry I'm in terms of you know not

319
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:12,670
just brand awareness but also obviously

320
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:15,569
brand loyalty right now a lot of what

321
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:17,709
moves at retail is very much driven by

322
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,390
manufactures ability and I'm sure all of

323
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:22,150
you sitting on this panel can fully

324
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:24,580
relate to this manufacturers ability to

325
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:28,539
scale and get products on the dispensary

326
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:31,990
shelves as a manufacturer my biggest

327
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:33,819
challenge to date is distribution I'm

328
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,740
sure you know about the distribution

329
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:39,220
industry in our in our sector here it's

330
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,899
it's a shitshow you know yeah it's

331
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,870
ridiculous and I mean I don't see it

332
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:45,399
ever coming to a stability it's probably

333
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,039
the last sector of our industry that's

334
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,959
gonna stabilize so you know for the 15

335
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:51,309
20 % of gross you know it's just not

336
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,710
enough for people you know it's just

337
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:55,479
it's it's yeah so until we get people

338
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,519
that are managing accounts properly and

339
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,170
right now as a manufacturer I have to go

340
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,269
in and manage the accounts myself which

341
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:02,709
is infuriating you know because it's the

342
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:05,860
last thing I want to be doing I want to

343
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:08,139
be making products that's not my job but

344
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,000
to ensure my prep brands you know

345
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:12,490
relevance and prevalence in the market I

346
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,919
gotta go do it so you know it is it's

347
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,620
frustrating I want to ask one quick

348
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:19,629
question time in your opinion how do we

349
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,209
negate and the flower side of things

350
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:23,188
what's happened in washing

351
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,198
what's happening or again how does

352
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:27,028
California not go there on that route I

353
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,828
mean the elephant in the room of your

354
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:31,528
graph was all of the other states were

355
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:33,118
trending downwards you know and I see

356
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:35,039
and I sit you're absolutely correct

357
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:37,079
California was it we were absolutely the

358
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,178
only one trending up so how do we

359
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:42,448
maintain that how do we not become or

360
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:43,980
you know Washington um okay I'm gonna

361
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:46,948
turn off my video so we don't get cut

362
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,649
off again so we didn't I didn't I don't

363
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:54,448
think I showed a state-by-state view of

364
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:56,879
price points I may have laughs I saw was

365
00:16:54,448 --> 00:17:06,230
just the three states year by year trend

366
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:09,679
up or down and then Washington anyway

367
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:12,659
but on the price point side though um

368
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:16,230
you know obviously a lot of that has to

369
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:19,649
do with supply and regulations right so

370
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:22,318
with or again specifically you know is a

371
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:24,808
bit of a free-for-all market right where

372
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,668
you know and and actually I'd be

373
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:28,859
interested to hear Chelsea and she has

374
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:33,210
speak to this but specifically Jeb but

375
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:35,099
we had you know in Oregon they were

376
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,350
handing out cultivation licenses like

377
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:38,879
there was no tomorrow right so you just

378
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:44,398
ended up in a situation where the market

379
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,470
was flooded with supply and and you know

380
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:49,558
it's also a good you know great growing

381
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:52,470
region right as is California but but

382
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:55,798
you know so so the light licensing is a

383
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:58,200
huge part and on the cultivation side

384
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:02,398
can we throw taxes into the mix what

385
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,710
role they play and then of taxes right

386
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:09,389
so California has some of the highest

387
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:11,278
taxation out of all states which in

388
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,740
general is gonna continue to impact

389
00:18:11,278 --> 00:18:14,940
consumer purchasing right I mean you

390
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,929
know we saw with the launch of adult

391
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:21,390
youth sales flower the flower category

392
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:22,740
took the biggest hit right and that's

393
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,110
because with the launch of adult you

394
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,839
sales right I'm in January 2018 in

395
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:30,359
California a lot of consumers you know

396
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:33,629
the prop 215 like longtime consumers

397
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,529
they were like you know for a part I'm

398
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,360
not gonna

399
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:46,379
what am i friend but like f this you

400
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:48,509
know and you know this is California we

401
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,950
know exactly you were defined cannabis

402
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:53,160
and have never had a hard time finding

403
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,450
it and so before a number that was

404
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,300
really interesting to me you mentioned

405
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,370
that California still has the highest

406
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:01,680
price for four per gram of marijuana is

407
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:03,779
that is that is that a fact and how are

408
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,410
we in relevance to Washington or Oregon

409
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:09,089
say not the highest and and you know I I

410
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:13,140
should have actually included a slide

411
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:14,669
for this and didn't but and I could look

412
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:26,370
while we're on the caller taking a

413
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:29,460
second but if I this is amazing I think

414
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:33,000
if I remember correctly California

415
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:38,130
second and flower price to Nevada okay

416
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,569
so so and I and I believe that's I'm not

417
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,060
sure if it's with or without tax you

418
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:44,819
know I'm I'm tempted to say it's without

419
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:48,599
tax but I know Nevada has some of the

420
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:52,339
highest prices by far in fact I think

421
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:56,089
the by the tourist market of Vegas or

422
00:19:52,339 --> 00:20:00,119
tourism Vegas you know I mean in general

423
00:19:56,089 --> 00:20:03,179
highly taxed market right but California

424
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:05,279
because I mean I don't we can get into

425
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,420
why California so highly taxed but I

426
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,039
don't know that that's the purpose of

427
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,170
this call and I'm sure that you guys

428
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:12,480
have heard it it weighs you know you've

429
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,900
heard it you know you we've all

430
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,009
exhausted that subject but and also you

431
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,430
could probably touch on it a lot better

432
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:22,720
than I did especially none of us make

433
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:26,630
any money

434
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,630
[Laughter]

435
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,100
yeah it's a marginalist business right

436
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:37,529
now I can I can play speak for everybody

437
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:39,809
here you know as a craft producer and a

438
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:42,240
craft manufacturer it's not a it's not a

439
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,829
it's not a profitable enterprise you're

440
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,140
just out there trying to maintain your

441
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:48,000
brand keep relevant keep in the

442
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,520
marketplace and if you're doing that you

443
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,269
doing great and you know that's my

444
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,829
opinion that's all we're doing City of

445
00:20:54,269 --> 00:21:04,339
California is your most expensive

446
00:20:55,829 --> 00:21:08,789
employee yeah absolutely so just quickly

447
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:12,329
chia-you you had mentioned kind of you

448
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:16,039
as a supplier to other people in terms

449
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:22,379
of your trim and even some of the flower

450
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:24,539
Mike you're sourcing from farms to make

451
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,330
solvent less extraction and Chelsea is

452
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:28,980
Newell's based on solvent or solvent

453
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:32,419
list extraction that can you both talk

454
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:35,930
about developing and maintaining

455
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:39,539
relationships with suppliers of raw

456
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:42,420
material and kind of the good the bad

457
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:45,420
the ugly of finding quality suppliers

458
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:55,560
and reliable suppliers and consistent

459
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:57,930
suppliers and and go yeah I've actually

460
00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:01,889
had really good luck with my suppliers

461
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:05,120
when I first started manufacturing in

462
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:08,160
the legal market we were sort of saying

463
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:13,589
ethanol extracted crude because we

464
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:15,300
mainly work in th CA and CB da so we

465
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:17,699
were sourcing ethanol extracted crude

466
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:21,329
that was made at the facility where we

467
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:24,059
did our manufacturing and they were

468
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:26,220
getting their material pretty much

469
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:30,049
exclusively from like southern on Bolton

470
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:32,759
Mendocino so you know it was pretty soon

471
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:34,349
I'm a little bit jealous of you Josie

472
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:39,629
because it sounds like you have an

473
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:44,009
easier time than me I'm sorry to hear

474
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:45,920
that man yeah yeah and it's funny is

475
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:48,890
I've never used the same source twice

476
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:53,900
because I'm always just shopping around

477
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:56,220
but uh so yeah so we had the we had that

478
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,620
we had the the crude that they were

479
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,190
making there and then they something

480
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:03,889
about a fair hazard

481
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,720
they wouldn't improve their extraction

482
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,410
any longer because of something about

483
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:12,470
the way the building was put up and so

484
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:14,930
so I had to go get it from elsewhere I

485
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:20,089
ended up getting from blessed extracts

486
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:24,890
the next time through and then the most

487
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:27,079
recent batch of products I made Wes it

488
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,000
had run out of what I needed and so I

489
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:32,089
actually called up Shannon Hatton

490
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,920
she took her flower over to a processor

491
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:39,649
and had it turned into crude and it was

492
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:41,509
in my hands a week later yeah I wish I

493
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,340
could say all that beautiful things like

494
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:45,740
you just said she'll see what I can I've

495
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:47,000
just our stories it's been terrible I

496
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,710
think it's a little bit more challenging

497
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,789
as a solving this producer because we

498
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:54,769
really have to be so careful about it is

499
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:56,930
you can't remediate there's no

500
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:59,059
remediation and solving this product is

501
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,080
your remediation you can remediate rosin

502
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:03,319
you can't remediate

503
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:06,619
you can remediate any of you really it's

504
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:08,419
either clean 100% so you know we've had

505
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:10,069
a rough time with it to be honest now

506
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,830
we're reduced to just finding it from

507
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:15,740
one specific lab downtown that's 900

508
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:18,529
light facility I know is super clean and

509
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,299
they are all the water but up north I've

510
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:22,819
had a real hard time with it because a

511
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:24,799
lot of the ground is contaminated even a

512
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:26,240
lot of these heritage farms and I'm and

513
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,579
I go back in the industry to the

514
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,410
traditional side of things these three

515
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:32,809
generation farms unfortunately a lot of

516
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,490
them are contaminated and I've learned

517
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:36,889
the hard way I mean I've had to shut

518
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,390
down my 80% of my northern production

519
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,790
because of it and the biomass up there

520
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:43,130
is much better and sun-grown biomass

521
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:50,480
makes much better concentrates always i

522
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:53,120
abour using lab are you talking about

523
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,769
chemicals are you talking about like

524
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:59,119
heavy metals more than anything heavy

525
00:24:54,769 --> 00:25:00,109
metals fucking heavy metals lead what's

526
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,179
your process

527
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:04,539
what's your process when you go out

528
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,070
north for checking the cleanliness

529
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:09,200
before you make a large sale how do you

530
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:11,480
do that at first there was little

531
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,850
processed tongue just by and then I

532
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,558
would end up you know taking a loss now

533
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:18,199
we have a really stringent process in

534
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:20,298
place it's um we you know we don't even

535
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,100
trust cos because a lot of the times the

536
00:25:20,298 --> 00:25:24,558
biomass were purchasing the only see a

537
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:26,089
way I get because the only person by law

538
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,490
that's required to do a stay-away on

539
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:32,359
biomass is the last user of the biomass

540
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:34,730
so essentially I am getting COS of the

541
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:36,288
flower and a lot of times it can be

542
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,240
indicative to a point but not truly

543
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:39,859
indicative because I'm concentrating the

544
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,000
product so I'm not only concentrating

545
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:43,038
the product I'm concentrating the

546
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,450
contaminants as well so even if I didn't

547
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,700
pass the Thresher if the threshold was

548
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,140
was I didn't pass the threshold on the

549
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,580
flower or the biomass there's a good

550
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,690
chance I'll pass it once I concentrate

551
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:53,210
it so you have to be very careful in

552
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,909
fact the stuff I use now has to be zero

553
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,860
mmm and you know non determined on

554
00:25:55,909 --> 00:26:00,320
everything on all 400 different things

555
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:04,399
so if there's even a little number there

556
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:06,048
on the on the CoA list I just oh can you

557
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,169
tasks in the field here they're things

558
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:11,210
you can do it no no it's a terrible

559
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:13,429
process it takes a week I gotta pay even

560
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:17,509
for the R&amp;D side for full panel I'm sure

561
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:19,390
everybody here knows it's a it's a bit

562
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:24,440
cheaper but down here best case scenario

563
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:26,179
600 700 800 and it's a week to wait it's

564
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,308
a real pain yeah it's a real pain

565
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:30,048
that's why I'm really limited and I wish

566
00:26:28,308 --> 00:26:32,329
I could do what josy does more because I

567
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:34,038
do have a lot of contacts you know

568
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:35,808
traditionally that's what I did I would

569
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:38,359
go where the best biomass wasn't and

570
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:40,399
that's what you know led my my my

571
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,769
process now it's led by other factors

572
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,870
unfortunately and and the biggest one of

573
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,220
them being is the cleanliness and I say

574
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,989
unfortunately on the other side of it

575
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,240
now I recognize that we were consuming a

576
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,980
lot of shits I'm glad that you know the

577
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,558
other side of me is thankful that I'm

578
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:57,829
not smoking level all the time so you

579
00:26:54,558 --> 00:27:01,668
know does it matter to you if it's

580
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:02,839
indoor green out of green out before

581
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:04,429
when I say sun-grown

582
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,899
that's what I mean it's it's the

583
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:08,480
difference between anything I was grown

584
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,788
in a in a controlled environment using

585
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,339
the Sun as opposed to using a controlled

586
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:16,308
environment if the lab now the lab stuff

587
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:17,689
and I and I you know and people are

588
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:21,200
gonna disagree with me on this I'm sure

589
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:24,019
but in my experience what I'm looking

590
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,370
for in my concentrate is an incredibly

591
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:29,920
oily long a long trial

592
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:31,839
long cannabinoid molecule and if you

593
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,920
look under if you take your concentrates

594
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,389
and you put them in a microscope that's

595
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,130
really interesting you'll see exactly

596
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:38,020
how all these categories are connecting

597
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,490
and how they're you know and distal it

598
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:40,990
looks different and cold water looks

599
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,400
different and co2 extraction looks

600
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,390
different and butane looks different

601
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,580
they all have their own little

602
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:49,330
differences um whereas what I'm looking

603
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:51,039
for is the longest possible molecule and

604
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:53,139
generally speaking when you're using the

605
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,808
Sun you're getting a much more developed

606
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,850
tripod when you're using doesn't matter

607
00:27:55,808 --> 00:28:01,299
what system you're using indoors it's

608
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:02,529
just never gonna be the same thing argue

609
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,349
back and forth about this but that's

610
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:07,450
where I land on this one in fact and the

611
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:10,058
market doesn't really resemble that

612
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,980
because in the outdoor stuff even if

613
00:28:10,058 --> 00:28:14,639
it's very very well maintained

614
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,500
you know these glass enclosed

615
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,440
greenhouses it's still cheaper than my

616
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,269
my lab grown biomass down here a upwards

617
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,700
of a hundred dollars down here for a

618
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:27,599
unit which is crazy compared to what I

619
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,769
used to pay so yeah a lot of challenges

620
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,409
prefer the Sun growing I wish I could

621
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:33,970
just go up north and shop like I used to

622
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,019
but yeah it's it's it's processed I'd

623
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,240
love to talk to you

624
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:40,769
Chia about potentially getting some here

625
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,769
biomass though now that I have you here

626
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:48,910
we're making deals right on the webcast

627
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:50,799
I love it but yeah if I could if I get a

628
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:57,460
permission to contact you after this

629
00:28:50,799 --> 00:29:00,579
I'll reach out and we can North in fact

630
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:03,610
we're expanding up north this next year

631
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:07,199
so we're very keen on solidifying some

632
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:09,879
supply lines up there so just quickly to

633
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,130
take a little change of pace I want to

634
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,700
bring Julie into the conversation so

635
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:18,580
Julie can you talk about what's top of

636
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,529
mind for you and your clients and what

637
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:24,639
kind of fires you're putting out and

638
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:27,279
whether Cove in nineteen has created

639
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:31,240
different fires or that's the same

640
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:40,269
business as usual' fires so the good

641
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:40,859
doctor dr. Julie Crockett yeah sure yeah

642
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:44,168
my

643
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:48,699
amazing she's my you know target market

644
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:53,320
is actual licensees and operators

645
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:56,470
because I I'm a compliance person so you

646
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:59,048
know my whole reason for being is to

647
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,850
help people navigate through all of

648
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:04,778
these systems and building their

649
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:08,259
compliance program dodging all the all

650
00:30:04,778 --> 00:30:11,140
the proverbial bullets of being a

651
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:14,379
licensed operator and this beautifully

652
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:18,549
over regulated system we have here in

653
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:23,260
California and yeah the code was

654
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:27,308
definitely I mean I'm I'm busier than

655
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:33,129
usual now it's been a very interesting

656
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:35,408
time for operators both with I think

657
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:40,240
anytime that you have to shift your

658
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:44,620
operations and take on new processes

659
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,450
especially during a crisis kind of as

660
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:48,969
Chelsea was saying about like the

661
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:51,278
delivery that she got paired up with

662
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,890
there's so many people who just jumped

663
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:56,558
to making curb-sider jump deliveries or

664
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:59,830
jump to doing contract free delivery

665
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:01,538
because it seemed logical that you would

666
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:04,359
do that to protect people without

667
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:06,839
necessarily taking the stops of getting

668
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:09,939
the right authorizations to do it or

669
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:12,459
documenting those processes or changing

670
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:16,240
their SOPs or training their staff on

671
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,640
new protocols so it's kind of you know

672
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,679
always the after-the-fact stuff like I

673
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:25,450
find that generally except for

674
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,360
incredibly forward-thinking operators

675
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:30,450
who are really committed to compliance

676
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:33,908
them to gate which isn't a lot

677
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,500
necessarily because obviously you guys

678
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:37,210
have different concerns and you're just

679
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,980
trying to survive and you're trying to

680
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:40,710
get on shelves you're trying to run your

681
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:44,048
business

682
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:46,090
usually compliance doesn't truly come

683
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:49,298
into it with any sense of earnestness

684
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:52,418
until one something goes wrong and then

685
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:54,750
they're like oh my god we have to make

686
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:57,720
sure that we can dig ourselves

687
00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:02,038
or you get that notice to comply or you

688
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:04,259
have to you know deal with a crisis so a

689
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,450
lot of times I'm brought into it either

690
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:08,908
in the midst of a crisis to try to

691
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:12,029
unravel it and get folks out of it or

692
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:13,980
you know in in the better case scenarios

693
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:16,470
where it's kind of slow and steady from

694
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,190
the gate and we get to really lay the

695
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:22,230
foundation but kind of like anybody

696
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:26,580
navigating their business they think one

697
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:30,360
of the biggest challenges with

698
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:32,129
compliance is you know kind of like it's

699
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:34,199
failure from the gate there's so many

700
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:37,409
things to comply with you there's gonna

701
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,409
be shortcoming somewhere so it does

702
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:42,900
become a lot of prioritization of what

703
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:45,480
are the most important things that we're

704
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,059
gonna or what's the the most evident

705
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:52,470
thing that you're going to possibly have

706
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:55,740
enforcement upon or issues with so

707
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,779
during this time it's been a lot of you

708
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:01,109
know even extending it out to safety

709
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:03,990
protocols and employee training and SOPs

710
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:06,959
and protecting people and even bringing

711
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:09,690
in aspects of HR and labor labor

712
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,038
relations because there's a lot of

713
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:13,110
businesses that have been trying to

714
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,450
navigate you know what are the impacts

715
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:17,339
of the federal payroll protection on my

716
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:21,480
business if you have over a certain

717
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:23,819
amount of employees or you know how any

718
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,788
whatever your local ordinances are what

719
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:28,859
is required of you in in certain

720
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:31,589
deadlines and you know the cannabis

721
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:36,149
industry is always under intense

722
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:37,678
scrutiny period and then now with the

723
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:40,380
addition of being deemed an essential

724
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,798
business it's kind of amplified that

725
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:46,320
scrutiny because it's a really

726
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:48,450
privileged position that that also we

727
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:52,139
don't want to lose for the industry so

728
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:53,759
if we start having a rash of people who

729
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,559
are getting sick or businesses that

730
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,349
aren't being responsible it's kind of

731
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:02,788
that aspect of we all need to do our

732
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:04,939
part to support the industry don't you

733
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:08,730
know to make sure that we all get to

734
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:11,309
maintain this you know with great

735
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,230
power comes great responsibility and

736
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:18,570
that part of you know being an essential

737
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:21,869
business at this time but you know a lot

738
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:24,320
of a lot of the the main focus a lot of

739
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:28,170
the shortcomings that I see with folks

740
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,150
happens and primarily in areas of

741
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:32,280
documentation because when you're in the

742
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:34,740
middle of a crisis notifying the

743
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,780
agencies or documenting your processes

744
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:40,709
or keeping your training logs up-to-date

745
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:44,150
aren't necessarily top of mine and that

746
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:46,470
there are so many timelines and

747
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,300
requirements built into the regulations

748
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:50,219
of if this happens you're supposed to

749
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:55,190
tell these people within this amount of

750
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:58,319
time and and I think like I was saying

751
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,700
day to day that stuff isn't really a big

752
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,530
deal and you're not saying a lot of

753
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:05,639
divorcement on it but the issues

754
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:08,250
typically are when one thing goes wrong

755
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:10,769
and then you get kind of that magnifying

756
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:12,869
glass put on your business that then the

757
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:17,070
agencies start discovering more and more

758
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:20,730
and more issues so it's it's that kind

759
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:22,769
of where you know the Pandora's Box gets

760
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:25,639
opened once they kind of start digging

761
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:28,199
in there and I definitely think that

762
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:30,569
operators should be preparing for the

763
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:33,000
fact like you know we've been going

764
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:34,620
through a lot of these tumultuous times

765
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,750
where there's a lot of demands on the

766
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:38,849
agencies themselves where we're getting

767
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,829
people temporary licenses for getting

768
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:43,949
people provisional licenses for trying

769
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:46,019
to on board these vacancies and my

770
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:48,809
scenario is always the board on a

771
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:50,880
Tuesday a couple years from now where

772
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:54,119
the agencies aren't bringing in tons of

773
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,880
tax revenue or licensing fees and they

774
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:59,400
really start to lean on levying

775
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,570
penalties and fines as a way to generate

776
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:09,269
that state income and they have a huge

777
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:11,220
amount of breath in terms of where they

778
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:12,659
can choose to do that and how long they

779
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:14,189
could do it for they have up to five

780
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:17,250
years to turn around and let be a

781
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,869
penalty or fine so all of these friendly

782
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,309
visits they've been having where they

783
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:23,548
come in and people are like it went

784
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:27,659
great they were nice they didn't say any

785
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:30,119
I've started to see people start to get

786
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:33,288
notices to comply four to six months

787
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:35,579
after that visit so they come and

788
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:37,439
everything's great and you think it went

789
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:39,028
great and four months later they're like

790
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:42,568
oh by the way when we were there in

791
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:43,978
January we noticed XYZ and you have 30

792
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:49,349
days to correct this or you're going to

793
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:51,149
lose your license so so my you know

794
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:53,039
we're all in this together but I like to

795
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,749
remind people like it's friendly as they

796
00:36:53,039 --> 00:37:00,269
may seem these people are not your

797
00:36:54,748 --> 00:37:02,639
friends and that you you really have to

798
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:05,668
be you know

799
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:08,098
cya is the word of the day in terms of

800
00:37:05,668 --> 00:37:13,278
making sure a lot of the way that we do

801
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:17,640
that and we do cover your assets is

802
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:19,739
through through documentation through

803
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:22,348
training logs and through meeting you

804
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:29,369
know at least the basics of the rake of

805
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:31,979
the regs so to get to I I'd love to take

806
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:34,459
these kind of general ideas and get down

807
00:37:31,978 --> 00:37:37,379
to some concrete examples so does anyone

808
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:39,808
Chia Mike or Chelsea do any of you want

809
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:43,259
to lie down on the doctor's couch and

810
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:44,999
and and unburden your souls about a

811
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:48,748
compliance issue you're currently

812
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:55,098
dealing with are you gonna question you

813
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:59,188
about her not particularly myself now

814
00:37:55,099 --> 00:38:02,400
hahaha and maybe we can throw the M word

815
00:37:59,188 --> 00:38:05,998
into the discussion the dreaded a met

816
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,418
rhetoric yeah and is that another like

817
00:38:05,998 --> 00:38:12,149
auditing of that you know is that

818
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:22,438
another big shoe that's gonna draw on

819
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:27,150
operators everyone knows you know in May

820
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:29,788
they show the ability to package so this

821
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:32,489
seemingly infinite grace period we had

822
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:34,680
about 30 days to onboard your existing

823
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:40,440
inventory Kim James

824
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:44,549
in on May 1st where now every package

825
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:47,250
has to have a source so so the state has

826
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:50,670
decreed that anything that exists at

827
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:52,530
this point is in the system and if it's

828
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,960
not then you're gonna have a much harder

829
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,240
time putting it in the system at this

830
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,329
point you know obviously that came out

831
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:03,269
with new guidance on the day of that

832
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:05,369
change in terms of how to do seeds and

833
00:39:03,269 --> 00:39:07,829
phones and tissue cultures and they got

834
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:12,179
the addition of a new little button in

835
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:14,429
the tremendously ridiculous workaround

836
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:16,559
that was previously there that you like

837
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:20,669
called your cuttings trash and turn them

838
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:22,829
into packages so we did see you know

839
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,230
that ship the next ship that's coming

840
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:27,449
they just released the notice for June

841
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:30,090
that now all the testing results are

842
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:32,189
going to be in metric and products won't

843
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:35,610
be able to proceed through the system if

844
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:38,039
they don't have in in in metric testing

845
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:40,829
results attached to them so again that

846
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:43,440
impacts some people's old inventory and

847
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:46,349
I think like I was saying there's all of

848
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,050
these regulatory notifications that are

849
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:50,670
required where right now you haven't

850
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,530
seen a lot of enforcement about it you

851
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:55,050
haven't seen a lot of divorcement about

852
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,460
you know report not reporting if you

853
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:58,740
have more than a three percent

854
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,840
discrepancy in a 30-day period for

855
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:04,819
example or a five percent discrepancy if

856
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:08,670
you're a manufacturer but we have to

857
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:10,950
know that metric is a gigantic data

858
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,349
collection system that's being reported

859
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:16,259
directly to the state so as their

860
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:19,170
analysts have more time to be able to

861
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,360
look at that system you will see people

862
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:25,289
start getting close and some people

863
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:40,829
distorted already of seeing something

864
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:47,340
anomalous and your metric data but you

865
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:48,538
will see people start to these are in a

866
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,489
system and following

867
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:53,369
up on that like I know October's in

868
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:55,019
Oregon for example that if you do

869
00:40:53,369 --> 00:41:01,709
something in your metric it's fishy

870
00:40:55,018 --> 00:41:04,188
you'll get a call in 24 hours weird like

871
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:06,808
you need to explain this so I think

872
00:41:04,188 --> 00:41:10,288
though those screws are starting to

873
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:12,449
ratchet down in that kinda you know

874
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:16,109
educational period we've all been in

875
00:41:12,449 --> 00:41:20,209
where the real forgiving and people are

876
00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:22,798
still figuring this out is winding down

877
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:24,958
sorry I have one more question for you

878
00:41:22,798 --> 00:41:27,599
we've been talking a lot about the

879
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:30,088
compassion programs especially in

880
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,179
California and how people want to

881
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:35,400
utilize them but I'm wondering people

882
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:38,479
won't utilize them if they're if they're

883
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:41,880
confused about how to integrate it into

884
00:41:38,478 --> 00:41:44,518
metric is it clear how to do that do you

885
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,660
know like how to take advantage of those

886
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:56,998
programs and not get in trouble doing so

887
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:59,668
yeah I think pre it's not that there's a

888
00:41:56,998 --> 00:42:02,728
lot of limitation today that the bill

889
00:41:59,668 --> 00:42:05,848
was written so so especially some of the

890
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:09,678
confusion comes from when a product in

891
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:13,109
its life cycle has to be designated as

892
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:14,309
compassion so so my understanding and I

893
00:42:13,108 --> 00:42:18,449
could be wrong because I have been

894
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:21,329
talking for this so deep at that level

895
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:22,739
is that you you can't midstream suddenly

896
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:25,259
decide that your product is

897
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:27,568
compassionate that a lot of that

898
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:29,278
designation I think in the intent of the

899
00:42:27,568 --> 00:42:31,380
bill was that you're supposed to know

900
00:42:29,278 --> 00:42:33,358
from the gate that a cultivator supposed

901
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:36,479
to be like great ok I'm going to

902
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:39,179
allocate 10% of everything I'm making is

903
00:42:36,478 --> 00:42:43,558
going to go to compassion now obviously

904
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:47,369
that's ridiculous and operators should

905
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:49,528
be able to designate at any time that

906
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:52,048
they want to donate that product and I

907
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:54,449
think right now some of that is

908
00:42:52,048 --> 00:42:57,329
happening in case-by-case basis where

909
00:42:54,449 --> 00:43:00,749
you're able to work with the agencies to

910
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:02,010
get that product designation change but

911
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:03,959
to truly

912
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:06,510
reap the tax benefits of that I think

913
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,750
you have to know waived earlier down the

914
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:12,360
supply chain what the intent is of that

915
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:14,070
product but and it's kind of like the

916
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,630
old days if we all remember when they

917
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:18,059
were composing the regs and they were

918
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:20,280
going to have separate medical and adult

919
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:22,559
use trails and they wanted you to know

920
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,540
from the gate well this I'm growing for

921
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,779
medical and this I'm going for adult use

922
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:32,369
and because we've kind of obliterated

923
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:34,230
those lines in in California it's it's

924
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:36,029
nonsensical at this point to try to

925
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:38,280
preserve those we ran into that issue

926
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:41,610
with kovat as well where certain

927
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:47,210
localities were considering only keeping

928
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:49,890
medical cannabis retailers open which

929
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:56,699
which was insane because we're like you

930
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:59,460
destroyed in this unification and that's

931
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:02,429
still a tax granting perspective that's

932
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:04,920
still I think one of the ones like the

933
00:44:02,429 --> 00:44:07,879
highway robbery aspects of the

934
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,619
regulations is when they combine the

935
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:14,460
medical and the adult use the fact that

936
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:18,449
a 15 percent adult use excise tax was

937
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:20,960
applied to medical products is such an

938
00:44:18,449 --> 00:44:20,960
egregious

939
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:27,929
ridiculous sin in my mind something that

940
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,080
I still hold out hope someday gets

941
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:33,509
unravel because it was never in our

942
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,400
medical program it was never the intent

943
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:38,630
and that was an adult use tax that

944
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,730
shouldn't be applied to medical cannabis

945
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:43,140
hey Julie two things first of all I love

946
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:45,150
that you're an activist first and

947
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:47,000
foremost that's fucking awesome you rock

948
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:49,950
two questions

949
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,650
firstly what point along the supply

950
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:54,809
chain will a biomass need to be Co aid

951
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:56,970
in these new regulations that you

952
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:58,889
mentioned is it going to be much earlier

953
00:44:56,969 --> 00:45:00,869
on because currently my understanding of

954
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:03,719
the regulation is that it's just the and

955
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:06,389
the end producer the end manufacturer of

956
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:07,980
the biomass needs to coa that biomass is

957
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:12,659
that going to change now with what you

958
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:15,750
mentioned yeah I know it wind testing is

959
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:17,190
required for it so you see in

960
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:20,130
yup day they went out there's a whole

961
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:29,099
little grid of you know kind of win

962
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:31,500
organized fun system it's like our own

963
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:37,739
time machine we get to experience like

964
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:40,320
late eighties technology everyday so

965
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:45,889
wild I want to play like you know pong

966
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:48,539
on it as well but so so there are

967
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:52,259
obviously any point in the supply chain

968
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:54,179
where you work required to have testing

969
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:57,330
at that point so for cultivator moving

970
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:59,879
you know raw mass out to a manufacturer

971
00:45:57,329 --> 00:46:02,400
that doesn't have to have a test it's

972
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:08,849
only where you would have had to have a

973
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:10,139
final compliance test to move okay

974
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,579
that's so great thank you for answering

975
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:13,920
that I thought I was already getting

976
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:15,659
worried um second thing I wanted to

977
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,480
mention was I did get a visit from the

978
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:20,399
BCC roughly three months ago and we had

979
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,590
exactly the same thing you say there was

980
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,450
a great meeting maybe one or two issues

981
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:27,930
on the packaging of the labeling but

982
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:30,539
stuff we were amending no problem should

983
00:46:27,929 --> 00:46:39,299
I expect something negative to happen in

984
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:42,449
the next two months there are things

985
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:45,360
that they pointed out to make sure that

986
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:47,789
internally you're creating a corrective

987
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:51,630
action plan you're documenting that and

988
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:53,789
you have that documentation of what went

989
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,829
wrong how you fixed it when you fix it

990
00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:57,989
what you did because when you do get a

991
00:46:55,829 --> 00:47:00,569
notice to comply and a notice to comply

992
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:04,859
it's a very scary looking document a lot

993
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:06,210
of people to respond to it seriously it

994
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,800
can be expensive because you want to

995
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,720
bring in your legal team to draft the

996
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:15,210
letter to make sure you get you you know

997
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:18,299
not to the agencies but it will make

998
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:20,280
that response if you do get one so much

999
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:23,670
easier if you already have all that

1000
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:27,090
documentation yeah we fixed it here's

1001
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:29,460
how we fixed it and everything's fine so

1002
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:31,440
so I think that's I mean that's a

1003
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:36,088
so that everyone is developing at this

1004
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:38,700
point is to get really comfortable with

1005
00:47:36,088 --> 00:47:42,869
the exposure and with the interactions

1006
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:44,669
with the agency to be able to show like

1007
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:49,140
here's my process here I'm documenting

1008
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:51,450
it logs are on point you know and in

1009
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:53,579
that once you have kind of that

1010
00:47:51,449 --> 00:47:56,819
documentation it really gives you that

1011
00:47:53,579 --> 00:48:00,088
sense of security and in same thing with

1012
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:01,980
how we use metric like I always

1013
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:05,099
encourage everybody to blow up that

1014
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,420
notes field in metric when you're making

1015
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,280
adjustments when you're making changes

1016
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,369
whatever you're saying because the whole

1017
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:14,099
question is if the agencies ask you

1018
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:16,410
about something four months from now do

1019
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:18,059
you have enough documentation on hand

1020
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:19,949
that you're gonna be able to go oh yes

1021
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:22,259
of course I know exactly what happened I

1022
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:24,000
you know destroyed that we have here's

1023
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:27,810
the weight ticket um you know whatever

1024
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,699
it is that it's easy for you to have

1025
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:33,449
that recall and have that documentation

1026
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:37,939
of you know pretty much just proving

1027
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:37,939
that you followed the correct protocol

1028
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:56,039
and it sounds like you're saying that

1029
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:58,260
the state never forgets compared to like

1030
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:00,119
buying insurance like you pay for your

1031
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:06,240
insurance all the time and most of the

1032
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:10,619
time hopefully you don't need it but

1033
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:13,189
it's that that you know because the

1034
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:17,550
agencies have so much discretion and

1035
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:20,639
because we don't have enough clear data

1036
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:23,430
yet on their enforcement priorities or

1037
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:25,079
their enforcement practices it really is

1038
00:49:23,429 --> 00:49:27,179
kind of like a needle in the haystack

1039
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,940
thing of like well maybe they're gonna

1040
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:32,219
show up and have a huge problem maybe

1041
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:36,079
with that and we don't really know in

1042
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:39,299
the in I think for the you know to keep

1043
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,519
operators from having ulcers and anxiety

1044
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,609
attacks and an already challenging

1045
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,318
environment

1046
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:48,768
that's one of the ways in which

1047
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:51,949
compliance can be really comforting like

1048
00:49:48,768 --> 00:49:56,778
I know where my binder is I can supply

1049
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:59,268
those those records and in and also not

1050
00:49:56,778 --> 00:50:03,048
being like a gerbil in a wheel like

1051
00:49:59,268 --> 00:50:06,048
having a really clear sense here's what

1052
00:50:03,048 --> 00:50:09,349
the regulations require of me I can

1053
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:11,478
check all of these boxes I can I know I

1054
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:14,838
have this documentation that they ask

1055
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:16,759
for in same thing and then you don't

1056
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:18,739
also don't have like software companies

1057
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:20,358
trying to sell you the jillion dollar

1058
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:22,039
software for a bunch of stuff you don't

1059
00:50:20,358 --> 00:50:24,170
need because you're like here's my kind

1060
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:26,839
of course this is what I need covered

1061
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:31,039
and then you know once you kind of have

1062
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:33,170
that sense of security that you know

1063
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:36,559
your baseline is pretty good then when

1064
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:38,420
you get the kind of like like Michael

1065
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,099
was saying like then you get into what

1066
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:42,889
you really want to be doing which is

1067
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:44,690
like creating new products and thinking

1068
00:50:42,889 --> 00:50:47,028
about how you make stuff and finessing

1069
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:50,690
your processes rather than spending so

1070
00:50:47,028 --> 00:50:54,469
much time just on these like basics of

1071
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:56,499
is track and trace working and am I

1072
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:59,329
gonna get in trouble today you know

1073
00:50:56,498 --> 00:51:03,259
really can I ask you a question have you

1074
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:06,619
heard of it I heard a rumor that CDFA or

1075
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:08,748
BCC was going to do virtual inspections

1076
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:12,130
during this Cove of 19 time have you

1077
00:51:08,748 --> 00:51:15,108
heard of anybody getting one of those

1078
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:18,019
the old I haven't heard of anybody

1079
00:51:15,108 --> 00:51:21,588
getting one unlike an enforcement visit

1080
00:51:18,018 --> 00:51:23,958
yet but I have heard that they may do

1081
00:51:21,588 --> 00:51:25,639
some of those for things like I mean

1082
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:28,759
this is what they're doing in Vegas for

1083
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:30,858
example for onboarding of licenses or if

1084
00:51:28,759 --> 00:51:33,679
you're adding a distribution vehicle and

1085
00:51:30,858 --> 00:51:36,348
they want to inspect it I've heard about

1086
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:38,538
them using it for those kind of aspects

1087
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:42,140
like if there's something in the license

1088
00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:44,449
as a renewal that requires a inspection

1089
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:46,818
to look forward but I haven't personally

1090
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:49,579
bought wouldn't put it past them heard

1091
00:51:46,818 --> 00:51:51,798
of somebody having like hey we need to

1092
00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:54,440
come look at your facility so put us on

1093
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:57,318
face time and walk us through yeah I

1094
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,749
just you know how

1095
00:51:57,318 --> 00:52:03,349
would work out you know for for me on a

1096
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:08,838
farm that would be really interesting

1097
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:09,829
and hard hard to do I think yeah and I

1098
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:12,259
agree with you

1099
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:14,479
like I would way rather be out there in

1100
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:16,670
the garden and my hands in the dirt then

1101
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:20,899
on the fucking computer pardon my french

1102
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:23,269
doing metric entry all the time like

1103
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:26,568
that's ice I do all that for our farm

1104
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:28,429
and it's endless and it's really

1105
00:52:26,568 --> 00:52:30,170
ridiculous and you know and when you

1106
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:33,948
were saying on this on May first when

1107
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:36,709
everybody had to enter all that data to

1108
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:39,440
like the original source thing I was

1109
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:42,228
actually trying to just make a transfer

1110
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,630
from a distributor to come to my farm

1111
00:52:42,228 --> 00:52:48,409
and the system was so locked up because

1112
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:51,619
it's so archaic that I could not get a

1113
00:52:48,409 --> 00:52:54,348
transfer manifest finished that day

1114
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:55,849
because of the fact that everybody was

1115
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:58,489
in the system trained to finalize all

1116
00:52:55,849 --> 00:53:00,548
this stuff so it was making business

1117
00:52:58,489 --> 00:53:03,259
really difficult just for regular

1118
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:05,088
transaction to happen when the van is

1119
00:53:03,259 --> 00:53:08,920
literally like on its way here and I

1120
00:53:05,088 --> 00:53:10,849
could not get the system to work so

1121
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,068
hopefully we moved past that

1122
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:15,349
I don't have any big surges in that

1123
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:18,498
system like that again but yeah I was

1124
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:23,359
really challenging day just quickly Chia

1125
00:53:18,498 --> 00:53:26,208
as our resident plant tagging expert can

1126
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:29,598
you give an update kind of a State of

1127
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:32,358
the Union on the sensibleness or non

1128
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,900
sensibleness like tell us what you have

1129
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:40,038
to do in relation to tagging plants from

1130
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:42,949
clones to juveniles to dine plants to

1131
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:45,289
whatever and where you see it going like

1132
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:49,309
what what are the conversations between

1133
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:52,699
cultivators and CDFA in terms of moving

1134
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:54,229
in a more sensible fair direction mm-hmm

1135
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:57,259
like are there crops

1136
00:53:54,228 --> 00:53:59,268
yeah I'd be happy to you know I think

1137
00:53:57,259 --> 00:54:01,940
just to touch on what Julie was saying a

1138
00:53:59,268 --> 00:54:04,218
moment ago about documentation the way

1139
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:07,759
that I create a lot of documentation in

1140
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:09,559
the metric system is I call them you

1141
00:54:07,759 --> 00:54:10,530
know I will email them or call them

1142
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:12,990
about

1143
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:15,390
tiny minut things and then they have to

1144
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:17,909
send you an email back that says yada

1145
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:20,129
yada do this that and the other thing so

1146
00:54:17,909 --> 00:54:22,339
that's the documentation and then I also

1147
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:25,680
do put a lot of notes in the notes field

1148
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:28,380
to protect myself because like you said

1149
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:31,769
with so I have a nursery and the

1150
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:34,530
cultivation license so there's a lot of

1151
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:36,269
you know little nuances within the

1152
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,430
nursery side of things that are really

1153
00:54:36,269 --> 00:54:41,190
challenging where I if I want to make

1154
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:44,460
clones right before I had to call them

1155
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:46,950
waste from a plant then I had to go in

1156
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:51,860
and create an item then I had to go

1157
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:54,989
create clones from this nothingness

1158
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:59,990
basically it was very weird like seven

1159
00:54:54,989 --> 00:55:04,049
steps to get to creating clones and then

1160
00:54:59,989 --> 00:55:07,649
you know you can clone you can tag one

1161
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:10,860
tray of say up to a hundred clones well

1162
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:12,090
the thing that's challenging in that is

1163
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:14,579
that there's a lot of stuff to pay

1164
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:16,740
attention to you know you have damping

1165
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:19,139
off you have you know things die things

1166
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:22,139
don't root whatever and that in that

1167
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:24,629
process but then moving them through the

1168
00:55:22,139 --> 00:55:25,980
system gets even more challenging

1169
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:28,769
because obviously you're not gonna put a

1170
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:31,019
metric tag around this tiny little stem

1171
00:55:28,769 --> 00:55:33,239
and like clog up your tray with all this

1172
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:37,170
stuff you have one tag on the tray well

1173
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:42,059
as soon as you move them into you can

1174
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:44,519
transplant them into dirt then like you

1175
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:46,110
don't have to put a tag on it and I

1176
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:48,480
started doing that in the beginning

1177
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:51,030
because why do extra work if you don't

1178
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,500
have to well the problem is that as you

1179
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:54,900
move those plants around and you put

1180
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,869
them somewhere in the greenhouse and

1181
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,920
then you you know things get confusing

1182
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:00,630
they get lost

1183
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,730
really easily and like what is this

1184
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:04,200
batch attached to that and you know

1185
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,490
there's a lot of tagging going on so I

1186
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:07,500
spend a lot of time creating

1187
00:56:05,489 --> 00:56:09,449
spreadsheets of tags on my own tagging

1188
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,849
system that matches up to the metric

1189
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:13,710
tagging system so that I know that this

1190
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:16,019
thing is related to that number and it's

1191
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:20,760
insane my own waste waste of time

1192
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:22,860
basically and then on another note so I

1193
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,120
have my cultivation Anna have my nursery

1194
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:26,250
if I want to move

1195
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:28,769
plants from my nursery which is

1196
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:31,559
literally one foot away from my

1197
00:56:28,769 --> 00:56:33,750
cultivation on my own farm I have to

1198
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:36,360
have a distributor on site come to my

1199
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:37,860
farm to move the plants which they don't

1200
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,950
actually touch them they just have to be

1201
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:43,620
here to sign the paper that says that

1202
00:56:40,949 --> 00:56:45,599
that happened otherwise I have to have

1203
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:47,759
my own distribution license which I

1204
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,469
don't I can't afford that

1205
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,000
I don't want that I don't want a vehicle

1206
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:52,230
I don't want to have to pay extra taxes

1207
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,130
I don't want to deal with all that

1208
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:59,210
bullshit so I have to find a distributor

1209
00:56:56,130 --> 00:57:03,570
and and make that happen like within a

1210
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:05,429
you know convenient time frame that like

1211
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:08,100
today for instance I have a distributor

1212
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:10,500
coming here right after this call that

1213
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:15,269
is gonna pick up the last of my cannabis

1214
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:16,739
from 2019 so I'm thinking okay well how

1215
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:18,989
can I utilize the fact that that

1216
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:21,689
distributor is going to be on site at

1217
00:57:18,989 --> 00:57:23,549
this time well maybe I should figure out

1218
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:26,340
real fast which plants I need to move

1219
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:28,200
from my nursery to my cultivation and

1220
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:31,829
make an extra transfer document have

1221
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:35,789
them do that on site so things like that

1222
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:38,369
are just completely wasted times just

1223
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:40,829
for clarification Shia are are the

1224
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:42,960
nursery and the cultivation the same

1225
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:56,759
corporate entity are they two different

1226
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:59,639
so it's the same company just that how

1227
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,980
those licenses interact where you know

1228
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:07,650
they may be they may have gotten

1229
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:09,210
multiple you know small licenses okay if

1230
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:12,360
I get all of these different small

1231
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:15,090
licenses but they failed to get a

1232
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:17,610
nursery license and a processing license

1233
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:21,000
so then you're in a horrible pickle

1234
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:22,920
where you can't have the immature area

1235
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,559
from one license serving up another

1236
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,180
license without that nursery license and

1237
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:30,630
you can't be processing all that

1238
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:33,059
cannabis in the same space if you don't

1239
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:35,369
have a processing license so you'd have

1240
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:37,139
you know people who already went through

1241
00:58:35,369 --> 00:58:37,679
the whole licensing process and then

1242
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:40,920
realize

1243
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:42,659
is that it doesn't it doesn't work you

1244
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,480
know in terms of how you're lighting up

1245
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:49,259
that system and having to go back either

1246
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:51,719
you get those additional licenses which

1247
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:54,470
is its own you know very difficult

1248
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:59,189
process or having to process

1249
00:58:54,469 --> 00:59:01,828
individually each and feed them from

1250
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:04,528
their own immature plant area which is

1251
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:08,750
also a ridiculous and terrible solution

1252
00:59:04,528 --> 00:59:13,230
and not to mention you know like all the

1253
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:16,170
the accounting and you know the time and

1254
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:19,199
the hours that it takes to if you had

1255
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:21,180
all those licenses one person is going

1256
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:24,058
to have to track all of those

1257
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:28,009
transactions through the whole system in

1258
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:31,619
your own system it takes so much time to

1259
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:33,720
to manage all that you know my husband

1260
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:36,210
is that is the cultivator he does all

1261
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:38,489
the farming really I mean I make it look

1262
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:43,170
pretty and and do all the metric stuff

1263
00:59:38,489 --> 00:59:48,058
out there but you know like there is no

1264
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:51,750
way no way even a 2500 square foot that

1265
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:53,849
those Cottage cultivators can do this on

1266
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:55,829
their own back in the day was one farmer

1267
00:59:53,849 --> 00:59:58,170
did his whole thing he did it from start

1268
00:59:55,829 --> 01:00:00,539
to finish on his own that was it right

1269
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:01,858
maybe he'd bring in some people here and

1270
01:00:00,539 --> 01:00:05,400
there to do the harvesting whatever

1271
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:07,769
these days you know I have to be a

1272
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,660
hundred percent I am the accountant

1273
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:11,880
I am the metric person I do all the

1274
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:13,889
sales I do all the collections I do all

1275
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,750
the bank you know everything myself and

1276
01:00:13,889 --> 01:00:18,629
I barely even get out into the garden

1277
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:21,358
and when I do you know it's wonderful it

1278
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:22,650
feels good but you know it's super

1279
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:26,818
frustrating and you know on the

1280
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:29,940
cultivation side like we have we've been

1281
01:00:26,818 --> 01:00:32,670
doing this this is our 22nd season of

1282
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:36,389
cultivating here on my farm or well

1283
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:38,579
nineteen on this farm and you know we've

1284
01:00:36,389 --> 01:00:40,379
we've seen it all we went through like

1285
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:42,150
you know growing up I went through the

1286
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:44,278
Reagan era of like hiding under the

1287
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:47,400
trees of the helicopters everywhere you

1288
01:00:44,278 --> 01:00:50,068
know we've done all that cultivated

1289
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,599
literally in platforms and trees and hid

1290
01:00:50,068 --> 01:00:53,880
stuff in the bushes and

1291
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,979
on the side of the hill in order to have

1292
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:59,969
this lifestyle and as soon as there was

1293
01:00:55,978 --> 01:01:02,368
a pathway to move into legalization we

1294
01:00:59,969 --> 01:01:04,380
took it every single step of the way

1295
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:06,140
and I've seen it all we've done

1296
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:10,009
everything we've complied with

1297
01:01:06,139 --> 01:01:13,228
everything possible in order to you know

1298
01:01:10,009 --> 01:01:16,139
live this culture and this is our

1299
01:01:13,228 --> 01:01:18,389
lifestyle cannabis is my life it's been

1300
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:22,139
that way forever I want to continue

1301
01:01:18,389 --> 01:01:24,808
doing this I want to pay taxes I want to

1302
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:28,199
be recognized I want to be in the legal

1303
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:30,589
market but it's so difficult and it's so

1304
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:32,969
challenging and it's so stressful that

1305
01:01:30,588 --> 01:01:35,099
there are days me and my husband turn to

1306
01:01:32,969 --> 01:01:37,259
each other and we were like can we move

1307
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:39,989
to a freakin tropical island tomorrow

1308
01:01:37,259 --> 01:01:41,969
like I don't want to do this anymore and

1309
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:45,259
it's because of all these little things

1310
01:01:41,969 --> 01:01:48,479
that we're talking about that are so

1311
01:01:45,259 --> 01:01:51,420
ridiculous and over you know just over

1312
01:01:48,478 --> 01:01:53,879
regulated there's way too much stuff

1313
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:55,769
that needs to happen and I understand

1314
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:58,140
like let's try to keep stuff out of the

1315
01:01:55,768 --> 01:02:01,429
black market sure like that's that's the

1316
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:05,748
point of the metric system right

1317
01:02:01,429 --> 01:02:08,038
ultimately you know there's a lot of

1318
01:02:05,748 --> 01:02:10,468
workarounds I see a lot of people doing

1319
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:12,209
really weird stuff asking strange

1320
01:02:10,469 --> 01:02:13,769
questions on this you know like mindo

1321
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:15,598
can action Peter you were asking about

1322
01:02:13,768 --> 01:02:18,358
that this is a forum that we have on

1323
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,609
Facebook where a lot of people in

1324
01:02:18,358 --> 01:02:23,038
Mendocino County and Beyond go on to ask

1325
01:02:20,608 --> 01:02:26,068
advice and share information and and all

1326
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:28,440
that on the network and you know nobody

1327
01:02:26,068 --> 01:02:30,389
really knows what to do and how to do it

1328
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,269
we're all just trying to help each other

1329
01:02:30,389 --> 01:02:35,038
through it and you can call a thousand

1330
01:02:33,268 --> 01:02:38,008
times and you'd get a different answer

1331
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:41,670
every time from somebody uh metric or

1332
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:44,579
you know you call BCC and nobody has an

1333
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:47,900
answer for you you call CDFA because

1334
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:54,449
like for instance I got a letter saying

1335
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:55,979
from CDFA saying that metric gosh I

1336
01:02:54,449 --> 01:02:59,039
can't remember exactly what it was at

1337
01:02:55,978 --> 01:03:01,828
this moment but that that I needed to do

1338
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,769
something in the in the metric system so

1339
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:05,450
I call metric to ask them how to do it

1340
01:03:04,768 --> 01:03:06,979
they say we don't

1341
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:09,949
we were talking about who sent you that

1342
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:12,740
letter CDF I sent it to me so call them

1343
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:15,980
okay so I call them they say we never

1344
01:03:12,739 --> 01:03:16,759
sent that to you like what am I supposed

1345
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,760
to do here

1346
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:21,770
you know I'm trying I'm just like

1347
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,839
backpedaling all the time to try to keep

1348
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:26,088
up with what I'm supposed to be doing in

1349
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:29,150
the meantime I could be spending that

1350
01:03:26,088 --> 01:03:31,759
time money and effort like making my

1351
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:33,829
brand better getting more contacts and

1352
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,480
dispensaries like you know there's a

1353
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:39,500
million other things I could do with my

1354
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:41,960
time so long story I have a question

1355
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:44,630
about how do you manage this these

1356
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:49,490
challenges in this pain across the 50

1357
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:51,950
farms under Mendes yeah so Mendocino

1358
01:03:49,489 --> 01:03:53,809
generations is an alliance of about 50

1359
01:03:51,949 --> 01:03:56,000
farms we we have fluctuated over the

1360
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:58,578
years we started in 2015 out of

1361
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,329
basically desperation of like how are we

1362
01:03:58,579 --> 01:04:04,400
as heritage cultivators gonna survive

1363
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:05,240
this tsunami that's coming we know

1364
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,380
that's coming

1365
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:11,419
so we aligned together to try to figure

1366
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:12,710
out ways to support each other like you

1367
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:16,809
know everybody says we're all in this

1368
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:20,780
together so I live in a back-to-the-land

1369
01:04:16,809 --> 01:04:23,179
hippie commune basically and I have a

1370
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:26,480
couple neighbors who are also about the

1371
01:04:23,179 --> 01:04:28,940
same ages age group as me and my husband

1372
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,099
and and they wanted to kind of move

1373
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:34,760
forward in legalization as well and they

1374
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:37,130
saw us sort of paving the way locally we

1375
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:39,290
had you know we got like the twelfth

1376
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:41,568
permit in Mendocino County we we always

1377
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:43,730
kind of got right in the front of the

1378
01:04:41,568 --> 01:04:47,000
line for things and so folks were like

1379
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:49,670
asking my advice and trained to to get

1380
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,068
help moving down that road and and you

1381
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:54,800
know there's a lot of folks who were in

1382
01:04:52,068 --> 01:04:58,250
that older age bracket in our group in

1383
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:00,019
the very beginning that they were on the

1384
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:03,230
verge of retirement but they'd been

1385
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:05,449
cultivating for 40 45 50 years some of

1386
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:07,880
them and they're teaching their children

1387
01:05:05,449 --> 01:05:10,159
to do it and and so the next generation

1388
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:12,710
is coming up but these this older

1389
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,809
generation sort of decided and realized

1390
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:16,789
as things started moving forward that

1391
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:18,759
they couldn't do this and they did not

1392
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:20,529
want to and they backed out

1393
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:23,740
so our group has sort of changed in

1394
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:26,110
numbers over the years but here we are

1395
01:05:23,739 --> 01:05:27,609
with somewhere around 50 farms and and

1396
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:29,320
those farms you know they're on their

1397
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:32,680
own they're their individual we're not

1398
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:34,570
necessarily always pushing and promoting

1399
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:37,899
we've tried different things like we

1400
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:39,940
tried putting different farms flower in

1401
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,860
one brand as the Mendocino generations

1402
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:44,139
brand that turned out to be kind of a

1403
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:46,980
nightmare on a lot of different levels

1404
01:05:44,139 --> 01:05:49,900
it's hard to keep track of those things

1405
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:53,769
but really we ultimately are pushing and

1406
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:56,110
helping you know get the sales going for

1407
01:05:53,769 --> 01:05:58,500
people helping them find good contacts

1408
01:05:56,110 --> 01:06:01,000
reliable manufacturers and distributors

1409
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:05,139
all the time and promoting that Sun

1410
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:10,900
grown Sun grown flower so does that

1411
01:06:05,139 --> 01:06:12,699
answer your question yeah it's it's been

1412
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,440
a challenge you know people are trying

1413
01:06:12,699 --> 01:06:16,869
to move forward and I think people

1414
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:18,579
really really want to do this and

1415
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:21,130
they're standing and lying down at

1416
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:24,279
planning and building and in Mendocino

1417
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:26,349
County trying to get you know their

1418
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,600
buildings permitted and their things in

1419
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:30,400
line so they can actually get a license

1420
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:32,589
and get a permit and that's not

1421
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,480
happening it's really not happening we

1422
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:37,000
had a surge in the beginning we have

1423
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,250
somewhere around two hundred and fifty

1424
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,670
some odd lice or permits in Mendocino

1425
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:46,780
County and that number has pretty much

1426
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:48,970
just stayed you know it for the last two

1427
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:52,030
years we haven't really seen new people

1428
01:06:48,969 --> 01:06:53,439
getting permitted but yet they're

1429
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:55,030
getting that state license they're

1430
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,880
jumping ahead and getting the state

1431
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:59,350
license because they've got like

1432
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,900
preliminary approval from the county and

1433
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:06,670
the county is just so far behind they

1434
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:09,160
cannot possibly you know right now

1435
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:11,619
they're closed down I can't get an

1436
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:13,239
answer and I have deadlines that are

1437
01:07:11,619 --> 01:07:16,210
coming up for myself for permits and

1438
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:17,889
licenses on various things so and you

1439
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:22,889
also mentioned earlier that you're

1440
01:07:17,889 --> 01:07:26,859
seeing a rise in embossed sin of

1441
01:07:22,889 --> 01:07:30,009
cultivators and Julia and these are also

1442
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:32,590
these are people who are trying to

1443
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:35,290
transition into the legal market

1444
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:37,570
haven't been successful yet and I'm

1445
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:39,699
wondering Julia you are you seeing any

1446
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:42,010
of that with people that are trying to

1447
01:07:39,699 --> 01:07:44,500
move in but the process is stalled or

1448
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:50,410
slowed down for them and then the hammer

1449
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:52,570
comes down on them well I mean I'm down

1450
01:07:50,409 --> 01:07:55,170
here in LA so the whole thing is a slow

1451
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:57,850
process down here

1452
01:07:55,170 --> 01:08:02,590
you know it's trying to get the next

1453
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:06,219
phase open and you know you certainly

1454
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:09,510
know I mean anecdotally I know people

1455
01:08:06,219 --> 01:08:13,750
who have been waiting a very very long

1456
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:18,690
day and you know expressing frustration

1457
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:21,579
and and I mean and other things that

1458
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:25,179
heartbreaking is like especially down

1459
01:08:21,579 --> 01:08:27,760
here is there is a kind of ease of you

1460
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:30,070
know there is a there's a draw and

1461
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:32,650
appeal to the illicit market because

1462
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:35,739
it's so much easier it's so many ways

1463
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:39,539
you take they are doing that especially

1464
01:08:35,739 --> 01:08:45,338
with cultivation like you're doing why

1465
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:48,338
yeah the people you know the heartbreak

1466
01:08:45,338 --> 01:08:50,909
and the promise of what prop 64 was

1467
01:08:48,338 --> 01:08:55,630
supposed to be it's supposed to mean

1468
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:57,519
both as that kind of legitimacy of

1469
01:08:55,630 --> 01:09:01,119
decriminalization and as a social

1470
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:04,270
justice bill like just the whole thing

1471
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:07,930
has been heartbreak after heartbreaker

1472
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:10,150
but not really panning out that way and

1473
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:12,700
even the protections and smaller family

1474
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:15,639
in all of it that we thought was you

1475
01:09:12,699 --> 01:09:20,800
know what many people thought they were

1476
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:24,940
going to get out of that bill and and in

1477
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:26,560
some ways to like the I don't know what

1478
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:29,679
the right word was impotent and

1479
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:35,050
misguided you know enforcement efforts

1480
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:39,609
in some way or just like the historical

1481
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:42,310
blindness that prohibition has never

1482
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:46,630
worked it's never worked it's never been

1483
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:51,759
a thing and I do hold out like try

1484
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:55,719
like and naive perhaps feeling that I

1485
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,800
believe that in you know maybe 10 years

1486
01:09:55,719 --> 01:09:59,889
or something

1487
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:02,020
I do think eventually cannabis will be

1488
01:09:59,889 --> 01:10:03,760
no different than almonds or lettuce or

1489
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:07,989
anything else like I think that I think

1490
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:09,760
that we'll get there and the reminder

1491
01:10:07,988 --> 01:10:11,888
for the people who are going through

1492
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:16,480
that process right now and who are doing

1493
01:10:11,889 --> 01:10:21,329
the licensing is that you know we are on

1494
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:24,869
the front lines of combatting so much

1495
01:10:21,329 --> 01:10:29,559
prejudice and stigma and prohibition and

1496
01:10:24,869 --> 01:10:33,039
fear in the minds of regulators who you

1497
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:35,590
know these are the same people who you

1498
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:41,139
know in their minds put cannabis as a

1499
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:44,529
Schedule one on par with all who think

1500
01:10:41,139 --> 01:10:46,719
like this is a huge social ill and

1501
01:10:44,529 --> 01:10:49,479
realizing like where the forces are

1502
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:53,289
coming from and the training and

1503
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:55,209
indoctrination that they've received you

1504
01:10:53,289 --> 01:10:58,090
know thinking that we're going to take

1505
01:10:55,210 --> 01:11:00,210
any opportunity in the license industry

1506
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:03,579
to divert to the illicit market where

1507
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:05,859
you know where those of us who are

1508
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:08,109
operating know like you're not you're

1509
01:11:05,859 --> 01:11:10,059
not gonna desert out of metric like

1510
01:11:08,109 --> 01:11:14,349
nobody's gonna put anything in metric

1511
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:17,380
but there's been gonna try no peace

1512
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:27,179
nobody nobody would even get a license

1513
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:32,199
who really has you know in and in that

1514
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:39,100
like how hard it is to try to do it

1515
01:11:32,198 --> 01:11:42,819
right at all and in how little help the

1516
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:44,590
industry is getting so far you know in

1517
01:11:42,819 --> 01:11:46,299
terms of the fact and especially even

1518
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:51,779
right now again back to kovat it's a

1519
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:55,510
very difficult time because because the

1520
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:57,519
public narrative of this time since

1521
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:59,560
being deemed essential is like well

1522
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,430
cannabis is booming and everybody's

1523
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:04,360
doing great

1524
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:08,680
it's been very difficult to get any

1525
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:12,069
sense of of relief from the agencies

1526
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:15,280
during this time for you know people you

1527
01:12:12,069 --> 01:12:17,559
know here we are in are like Gio was

1528
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:19,899
saying where people had license renewals

1529
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,970
and local offices are closed and it's

1530
01:12:19,899 --> 01:12:23,739
difficult to move these processes along

1531
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:25,869
in the state's perspective is like

1532
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:27,969
you're doing great so yeah on track

1533
01:12:25,869 --> 01:12:32,109
failure licensing key let's do it and

1534
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:36,610
there's no grace period there's no

1535
01:12:32,109 --> 01:12:38,920
extension of deadlines there's no tax

1536
01:12:36,609 --> 01:12:43,000
relief and then even from a legislative

1537
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:45,430
perspective of all of these you know

1538
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,250
things that we were still trying to push

1539
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:50,980
it push along because legislatively we

1540
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:53,470
know like last year there's still no

1541
01:12:50,979 --> 01:12:55,809
trade samples like all trade samples

1542
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:58,539
bill failed there's no tax relief for

1543
01:12:55,810 --> 01:13:01,690
reform and and there's not gonna be

1544
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:03,819
because now every single bill at the

1545
01:13:01,689 --> 01:13:07,960
legislative level is put on hold and

1546
01:13:03,819 --> 01:13:15,189
lost it directly relates to covin but

1547
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:37,270
then it's also restructuring that the we

1548
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:39,339
are yeah we're doing it and it's just so

1549
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:43,930
heartbreaking because we're like we're

1550
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:46,779
like the were like like the abused child

1551
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:55,480
that just can never like impress their

1552
01:13:46,779 --> 01:14:00,969
parents and we just keep showing up you

1553
01:13:55,479 --> 01:14:05,589
know to try to you know to try to help

1554
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:07,900
him sin it's so it's so absurd and I and

1555
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:11,560
I like to like jump forward and look

1556
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:13,929
back on it from my future historical

1557
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:19,320
perspective where it's I will

1558
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:21,789
about this shitshow that is California

1559
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:25,299
regulated California cannabis so just

1560
01:14:21,789 --> 01:14:27,220
quickly were we're on the we're on the

1561
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:30,610
home stretch and I want to give people

1562
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:32,560
an opportunity to draw attention to

1563
01:14:30,609 --> 01:14:34,569
something that they think the California

1564
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:38,490
cannabis community should pay attention

1565
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:42,159
to you said Jie I want to start with you

1566
01:14:38,489 --> 01:14:44,469
can you talk about some raids and busts

1567
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:47,889
that have been going on recently in your

1568
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:51,820
neck of the woods okay so yeah so

1569
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:53,860
meanwhile those departments are still

1570
01:14:51,819 --> 01:14:55,960
active right those guys are still

1571
01:14:53,859 --> 01:14:58,659
busting people and some things are for

1572
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:00,909
good reason there's some interesting

1573
01:14:58,659 --> 01:15:02,769
things going on and up in our area in

1574
01:15:00,909 --> 01:15:05,109
the Colville area there was recently a

1575
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:07,120
very large bust that they had been

1576
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:10,869
trying to bust for a while they didn't

1577
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:12,970
really quite have a reason to or you

1578
01:15:10,869 --> 01:15:14,559
know I just hadn't thought it started

1579
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:17,710
and there was a missing-persons report

1580
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:21,700
turns out it's tied to this big bust

1581
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:24,909
that just happened there and you know

1582
01:15:21,699 --> 01:15:27,189
these are illegal operators and you know

1583
01:15:24,909 --> 01:15:29,920
they they even some of the covilhã

1584
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:31,449
residents have remarked lately that that

1585
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,190
operation has cleaned up the

1586
01:15:31,449 --> 01:15:35,199
neighborhood because it's very tight and

1587
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:38,949
and nice-looking it looks like a legal

1588
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:41,590
operation from the outside and you know

1589
01:15:38,949 --> 01:15:44,050
then we have these other folks for

1590
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:46,140
instance in Humboldt recently where

1591
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:51,130
there has been some oh there we go

1592
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:55,450
yeah Peters got it up there um so

1593
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:58,779
there's been some busts recently in

1594
01:15:55,449 --> 01:16:01,179
Humboldt County and northern Mendocino

1595
01:15:58,779 --> 01:16:03,909
County where some of these people have

1596
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:06,280
been trying to get licensed they have

1597
01:16:03,909 --> 01:16:08,680
been in line they put in an application

1598
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:10,000
they have like done the things that they

1599
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,829
need to do and for some reason they

1600
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,710
can't move forward maybe it's they can't

1601
01:16:11,829 --> 01:16:18,309
move past the Department of Fish and

1602
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:20,859
Wildlife maybe they are not able to get

1603
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:23,440
that piece of the puzzle finalized I

1604
01:16:20,859 --> 01:16:26,109
have a neighbor for instance who has

1605
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:27,129
been waiting for his local permit for

1606
01:16:26,109 --> 01:16:29,198
two years

1607
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:32,310
there is zero reason he should not be

1608
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:35,138
getting that it's just that they have

1609
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:37,750
over 2,000 applications sitting on their

1610
01:16:35,139 --> 01:16:39,750
desk they've approved 250 of them

1611
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:41,859
they've denied about the same amount

1612
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:44,319
what's going on with the rest of that

1613
01:16:41,859 --> 01:16:45,759
stack and in the meantime those people

1614
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:47,769
are obviously gonna keep cultivating

1615
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,210
because that's how they pay their bills

1616
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,159
that's how they live they're not gonna

1617
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:54,578
go get a job especially not right now

1618
01:16:51,158 --> 01:16:56,348
and you know so then you have the

1619
01:16:54,578 --> 01:16:57,880
helicopters flying around they're still

1620
01:16:56,349 --> 01:16:59,679
busting people they're still drawing

1621
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:01,300
maps with circles on them saying you

1622
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:04,658
know these are the targets we're gonna

1623
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:06,730
hit this summer and those people are you

1624
01:17:04,658 --> 01:17:07,929
know they're family folk they they've

1625
01:17:06,729 --> 01:17:09,879
been trying they've been doing this

1626
01:17:07,929 --> 01:17:12,819
forever they would like to be in the

1627
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:15,190
system they would like to pay taxes you

1628
01:17:12,819 --> 01:17:18,729
know they want to do that but yet they

1629
01:17:15,189 --> 01:17:20,289
cannot and so those busts have been

1630
01:17:18,729 --> 01:17:23,039
happening and and that's pretty

1631
01:17:20,289 --> 01:17:26,889
frustrating for somebody like me who is

1632
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:29,618
regulated and and licensed to watch my

1633
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:31,480
friends and neighbors get in trouble for

1634
01:17:29,618 --> 01:17:33,039
something that I almost feel it's like

1635
01:17:31,479 --> 01:17:34,809
you know when there was the fires and

1636
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:35,948
your house survives and you and your

1637
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:37,869
neighbor's burns down you have

1638
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:40,078
survivor's guilt it's kind of a same

1639
01:17:37,868 --> 01:17:42,939
thing I feel bad for those people

1640
01:17:40,078 --> 01:17:45,609
they've been trying they want to do it

1641
01:17:42,939 --> 01:17:48,969
so yeah so there's some of that going on

1642
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:52,089
Peter um I don't know too much detail

1643
01:17:48,969 --> 01:17:53,980
and I don't know I haven't had any

1644
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:56,980
personal friends necessarily get busted

1645
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:58,328
in this year but um you know I'm sure

1646
01:17:56,979 --> 01:18:00,519
that that's going to happen

1647
01:17:58,328 --> 01:18:02,439
unfortunately hopefully they'll leave

1648
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,079
the little guys alone and go for these

1649
01:18:02,439 --> 01:18:07,210
more large egregious things especially

1650
01:18:05,078 --> 01:18:09,130
ones that are on you know forest land

1651
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:14,349
and and publicly and some things like

1652
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:17,739
that like they used to do Mike anything

1653
01:18:14,349 --> 01:18:22,779
top of mind for you down here in the the

1654
01:18:17,738 --> 01:18:27,189
the LA world hold on wait let me unmute

1655
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:29,469
you okay and Mike and Mike you're you're

1656
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:34,719
someone who in the midst of all of this

1657
01:18:29,469 --> 01:18:36,819
is actually launching a new product so

1658
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:38,859
not only is it a challenge to launch a

1659
01:18:36,819 --> 01:18:40,899
new brand a new product line which we're

1660
01:18:38,859 --> 01:18:42,339
doing but expanding Cali

1661
01:18:40,899 --> 01:18:43,689
has been a challenge as well the only

1662
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:46,690
way we've been able to expand

1663
01:18:43,689 --> 01:18:49,509
traditionally is by getting out there to

1664
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:51,879
the dispensaries faced you know face

1665
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:53,679
time and obviously that's been

1666
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:56,859
impossible so it's really been a

1667
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:59,260
challenge um so yeah launching hash lab

1668
01:18:56,859 --> 01:19:01,809
is we haven't launched the product yet

1669
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:04,380
we're probably three weeks out and no

1670
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:09,699
and no trade samples either right

1671
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:12,210
samples and but the minute that that we

1672
01:19:09,698 --> 01:19:15,698
are you know we're gonna it's gonna be a

1673
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:17,590
much less aggressive rollout you know

1674
01:19:15,698 --> 01:19:20,919
whereas traditionally we would have

1675
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:23,319
approached all 50 retailers that I

1676
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:26,469
currently have product in now I'm gonna

1677
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:28,750
target 10 to 15 and and roll it out a

1678
01:19:26,469 --> 01:19:31,569
little bit more trashed a little bit

1679
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:33,760
more a case but that's just you know

1680
01:19:31,569 --> 01:19:35,469
just being cautious we're also moving

1681
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,810
facilities so you know there's a lot of

1682
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:40,658
internal reasons for that as well but

1683
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:42,880
for us we're such a small guy I mean we

1684
01:19:40,658 --> 01:19:44,948
are like the definition of small and

1685
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,289
every way I never took investment from

1686
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:49,000
anybody the way we got to where we are

1687
01:19:47,289 --> 01:19:51,729
today is by partnering with like-minded

1688
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,679
people from the traditional space you

1689
01:19:51,729 --> 01:19:56,948
know I'm not part of the new wave of

1690
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:58,658
marijuana thank God and so and it's

1691
01:19:56,948 --> 01:20:00,579
actually played to our advantage right

1692
01:19:58,658 --> 01:20:04,000
now not only did the consumer recognize

1693
01:20:00,579 --> 01:20:05,649
us as being heritage authentic but now

1694
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,689
we're picking up the pieces from a lot

1695
01:20:05,649 --> 01:20:09,099
of these these guys I mean I'll give you

1696
01:20:07,689 --> 01:20:11,439
the perfect example from my point of

1697
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:14,710
view a year ago I couldn't find a lab

1698
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:17,919
space for less than $12 a square foot

1699
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:20,590
now I have over 250,000 square feet

1700
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:23,260
available downtown for roughly between 2

1701
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:25,690
and 3 dollars I mean so it's like it's a

1702
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:27,449
vastly different market than it was six

1703
01:20:25,689 --> 01:20:29,829
months ago and I'm sure you've been

1704
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:31,658
everybody here and Chia especially can

1705
01:20:29,829 --> 01:20:33,640
appreciate that you know you to survive

1706
01:20:31,658 --> 01:20:36,279
in this in this industry have to be so

1707
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:38,619
nimble so lean and nimble is the phrase

1708
01:20:36,279 --> 01:20:40,000
I like to use a lot and and a lot of

1709
01:20:38,619 --> 01:20:41,769
these big guys don't have that ability

1710
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,609
and they're just hemorrhaging capital

1711
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:47,020
madmen you know even Ken Destin was

1712
01:20:45,609 --> 01:20:48,488
mentioned earlier I mean if you look at

1713
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:50,080
their ballot that they're at their books

1714
01:20:48,488 --> 01:20:52,238
you know it's it's it's a murder scene

1715
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:54,229
I've never seen so much red in my life

1716
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:55,759
so you know in the end

1717
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:57,769
today you know who's gonna be there in

1718
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,110
the long run I don't know it's anybody's

1719
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:01,970
guess at this point but what I do know

1720
01:21:00,109 --> 01:21:04,699
is that when you're operating an entity

1721
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:06,829
with zero debt and you have you know

1722
01:21:04,699 --> 01:21:08,779
market share and you have customer

1723
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:10,579
loyalty you know I think you're in a

1724
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:12,019
better position than maybe these bigger

1725
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:14,510
guys that might have more market share

1726
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:16,730
but they have incredible amount of debt

1727
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:18,230
they're answering to investors from Wall

1728
01:21:16,729 --> 01:21:20,599
Street investors from God knows where

1729
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:22,609
else and the plug can be pulled at any

1730
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:24,260
time and they're beholden to the capital

1731
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:26,329
markets which are gonna dry up in the

1732
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:28,670
next year which already are dried up so

1733
01:21:26,329 --> 01:21:30,140
you know I think all of us are

1734
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:31,940
positioned much better than those guys

1735
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:34,100
right now so I think I want to leave it

1736
01:21:31,939 --> 01:21:36,469
oh man no the little guy is King right

1737
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:40,579
now and you know and long live the

1738
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:41,989
little guy and so if people are watching

1739
01:21:40,579 --> 01:21:44,149
and are about to go into their

1740
01:21:41,988 --> 01:21:46,879
dispensary should they support the

1741
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:48,229
little guy please support we just

1742
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,029
launched our critical line and that's

1743
01:21:48,229 --> 01:21:52,819
how we actually are expanding in this

1744
01:21:50,029 --> 01:21:55,189
environment it's by launching other

1745
01:21:52,819 --> 01:21:56,899
product categories under our current

1746
01:21:55,189 --> 01:21:58,519
brands well aren't you the whole new

1747
01:21:56,899 --> 01:22:01,189
brand is gonna be challenging I don't

1748
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:03,050
deny that but the way we're surviving

1749
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:05,988
right now like for example we just

1750
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:07,760
expanded our product category to include

1751
01:22:05,988 --> 01:22:09,919
pre-rolls so we're now we have infused

1752
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,210
pre-rolls and I don't know Tamar you

1753
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:13,760
still around I can't see you in my

1754
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:15,380
videos but the BDS analytics numbers

1755
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:18,409
that I just that I used that I almost

1756
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:19,779
frequently cite or 2% of the general

1757
01:22:18,409 --> 01:22:21,529
market is cold water extract

1758
01:22:19,779 --> 01:22:22,929
30-something percent of the general

1759
01:22:21,529 --> 01:22:26,449
market is pre-rolls

1760
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:28,220
or whatever ten percent was it whatever

1761
01:22:26,449 --> 01:22:29,840
it is but the point is it's a much

1762
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:31,820
bigger portion in the market you know

1763
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,529
Kelly Hodge was very specialized in the

1764
01:22:31,819 --> 01:22:36,920
beginning so we had a very very limited

1765
01:22:33,529 --> 01:22:39,109
market and so the way we hope to grow

1766
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:42,289
hope to survive hope to expand going

1767
01:22:39,109 --> 01:22:44,269
forward is by using that loyalty to our

1768
01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:46,340
advantage using our customer base to our

1769
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:48,680
advantage and slowly developing new

1770
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:51,140
product lines and new categories that

1771
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:53,000
then our people appreciate and again our

1772
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:56,630
our branding is all about cleanliness

1773
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:58,640
all about solving lists so we're hoping

1774
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:00,829
that resonates with the consumers and

1775
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:02,480
our tincture of our new brand tastes

1776
01:23:00,829 --> 01:23:03,800
amazing I know time when I was talking

1777
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:06,289
about taste earlier so I'm very excited

1778
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,850
to hear about that because all the vast

1779
01:23:06,289 --> 01:23:10,460
majority of dangers out there

1780
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:12,860
tastes a little funky so we're really

1781
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:15,680
happy it's not flavored it tastes like

1782
01:23:12,859 --> 01:23:18,229
it's all that's in it ingredient wise is

1783
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:20,240
hash and MCT oil and you know in

1784
01:23:18,229 --> 01:23:22,339
specific curing methods to get different

1785
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:24,319
formulas there's some more nuance to it

1786
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:26,180
than just that but essentially that's it

1787
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:29,239
so you're the flavor profile your gain

1788
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:31,310
is very benign they're very soft creamy

1789
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:34,069
almost you're getting a lot of the hash

1790
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:36,080
Sheen the pepper you know those those

1791
01:23:34,069 --> 01:23:38,239
terpenes you're not getting any alcohol

1792
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:41,359
obviously that's only MCT oil you're not

1793
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:44,449
getting any any additive flavorings no

1794
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:47,599
you're talking artificial strawberry or

1795
01:23:44,449 --> 01:23:49,039
whatever people are that so yeah you

1796
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,980
know pina colada

1797
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:54,159
ya know and teach their own but you know

1798
01:23:51,979 --> 01:23:57,259
we really I'm a big believer in

1799
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:59,119
authenticity purist you know and really

1800
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:01,730
does not complicating things you know

1801
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:08,989
minimal amount of ingredients simplicity

1802
01:24:01,729 --> 01:24:11,809
they keep it simple kiss Chelsea how

1803
01:24:08,989 --> 01:24:13,579
about you are you launching are you guys

1804
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:15,560
do you have any new products in the in

1805
01:24:13,579 --> 01:24:17,600
the works and can you talk about your

1806
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:25,100
you guys are small do you have outside

1807
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:28,880
investors I don't want to talk too much

1808
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:32,210
about the funding thing that's getting a

1809
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:35,409
little into the weeds but um we

1810
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:39,560
definitely are launching new products I

1811
01:24:35,409 --> 01:24:42,619
had done a one-off test batch of a bath

1812
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:44,570
soap back in like November we entered

1813
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:47,510
that into the Emerald cup and it won in

1814
01:24:44,569 --> 01:24:50,420
the CVE category and we'd so we've just

1815
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:54,350
finally done like a full size production

1816
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:57,199
batch for the market of that and that

1817
01:24:54,350 --> 01:25:01,090
started going out to stores like three

1818
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:01,090
ish No about a month ago actually

1819
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:05,119
and that was that's been complicated it

1820
01:25:03,319 --> 01:25:08,029
with kovin that I think there were a

1821
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:12,800
whole six weeks or so where we didn't

1822
01:25:08,029 --> 01:25:16,519
sell anything because our sales people

1823
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:20,659
were all not able to do any face-to-face

1824
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:21,770
time there was a couple weeks where I

1825
01:25:20,659 --> 01:25:26,300
called around

1826
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:28,370
to buyers and they were they were in

1827
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:31,369
quarantine I guess they thought that

1828
01:25:28,369 --> 01:25:34,010
they had had exposure and so they were

1829
01:25:31,369 --> 01:25:36,500
isolating for two weeks and not involved

1830
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:38,510
in the operation and even stores that

1831
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:41,409
we're doing a steady throughput just not

1832
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:46,600
being able to have that in-store

1833
01:25:41,409 --> 01:25:50,630
experience has really impacted sales but

1834
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:54,500
just quickly is that the bath bomb yes

1835
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:56,390
so that was the original the first run

1836
01:25:54,500 --> 01:26:00,319
packaging it's a little bit different

1837
01:25:56,390 --> 01:26:04,490
now but yeah that's oak is it a ball

1838
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:06,649
chelsea no no no it's a it's a salt so

1839
01:26:04,489 --> 01:26:16,579
it's a Epsom salt Thank You Malayan

1840
01:26:06,649 --> 01:26:18,710
blends yeah I should probably put more

1841
01:26:16,579 --> 01:26:20,779
than happy to put a word in for you

1842
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:22,579
Chelsea I've got some great relationship

1843
01:26:20,779 --> 01:26:29,659
and I didn't get stuff on their shelves

1844
01:26:22,579 --> 01:26:31,279
just with the phone call so yeah okay I

1845
01:26:29,659 --> 01:26:39,739
really appreciate that yeah that'd be

1846
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:41,989
great so we're all so we're planning

1847
01:26:39,739 --> 01:26:45,079
over the next like six months to drop a

1848
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:46,880
massage oil that is a variation on our

1849
01:26:45,079 --> 01:26:49,130
original formula but just instead of

1850
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:51,440
being designed to absorb super fast it's

1851
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:53,989
designed to do the opposite to stay in

1852
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:57,889
place on the skin for a long duration so

1853
01:26:53,989 --> 01:27:00,649
the actual massage can occur and then

1854
01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:03,650
we're getting into so part of that

1855
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:05,179
funding thing it's taken care of it

1856
01:27:03,649 --> 01:27:07,969
comes with a part and our partner has

1857
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:11,390
big machines like gel encapsulation

1858
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:15,470
mission so we're gonna actually putting

1859
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:19,880
out a line of mixed botanicals with

1860
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:22,880
select cannabinoid profiles for you know

1861
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:24,890
addressing various specific issues but

1862
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,659
like I was gonna say a nutraceutical

1863
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:28,670
yeah so it's cool that they have toys

1864
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:30,769
you can play with and and make

1865
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:34,130
interesting products out of that excites

1866
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:35,690
you yes very much so

1867
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:39,920
and she

1868
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:43,939
any any new are you guys all flower and

1869
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:45,980
pre-rolls or you uh yeah actually I have

1870
01:27:43,939 --> 01:27:48,969
a line of topicals that I've been making

1871
01:27:45,979 --> 01:27:52,279
for about 15 years that I'm hoping to

1872
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:54,170
launch this year ice we were trying to

1873
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:57,710
do that in March but that didn't quite

1874
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:59,960
happen so maybe we'll get that together

1875
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:03,890
by this coming winter we had issues with

1876
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:06,380
manufacturing space as well but yeah I

1877
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:08,119
just continuing flower I have a crop in

1878
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:11,239
the ground right now so light that will

1879
01:28:08,119 --> 01:28:15,470
be out in about six to eight weeks we'll

1880
01:28:11,239 --> 01:28:17,689
have some fresh goodness so looking

1881
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:19,970
forward to that and and they're there

1882
01:28:17,689 --> 01:28:22,009
any new genetics you're running this

1883
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:24,680
season or is it all same as last year

1884
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:26,030
yeah we will have some new things we had

1885
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:28,280
a new strain this last year called

1886
01:28:26,029 --> 01:28:31,399
pineapple cheesecake and just I was

1887
01:28:28,279 --> 01:28:33,259
really happy to hear about the taste and

1888
01:28:31,399 --> 01:28:34,939
the flavor being like the number one

1889
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:36,230
thing that we've got a ton of great

1890
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:38,089
response on that people love the

1891
01:28:36,229 --> 01:28:41,539
pineapple cheesecake

1892
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:43,150
so excited about that and we're also

1893
01:28:41,539 --> 01:28:45,079
moving into working with the

1894
01:28:43,149 --> 01:28:50,750
manufacturer that we're gonna be making

1895
01:28:45,079 --> 01:28:51,920
some specific some RSO basically for for

1896
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:54,590
the market which is something that you

1897
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:57,109
know are are they based in Mendocino as

1898
01:28:54,590 --> 01:29:00,829
well are they local no they're actually

1899
01:28:57,109 --> 01:29:05,569
in San Francisco and they also they have

1900
01:29:00,829 --> 01:29:06,649
a delivery service as well so it'll be a

1901
01:29:05,569 --> 01:29:10,639
great way to just you know

1902
01:29:06,649 --> 01:29:12,979
direct-to-consumer they have a great

1903
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:16,880
they already have a good consumer base

1904
01:29:12,979 --> 01:29:18,079
for that product as well and so anyways

1905
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,090
I'm looking forward to that just

1906
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:22,340
providing some some real medicine you

1907
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:24,079
know we're all about medicine people and

1908
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:26,000
and you know better living through

1909
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:29,210
cannabis is our motto and then whatever

1910
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:33,289
that takes you know whatever people need

1911
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:35,630
really it's interesting to me that

1912
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:37,640
you've been making topicals for fifteen

1913
01:29:35,630 --> 01:29:39,949
years and then the nightmare that is the

1914
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:42,829
regulated California market it is

1915
01:29:39,949 --> 01:29:46,340
difficult for you to on board them into

1916
01:29:42,829 --> 01:29:49,170
your business yeah the challenge is that

1917
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:51,360
it's you know I maybe I

1918
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:55,199
a little witchy and I make every batch

1919
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:57,719
is slightly different and you know like

1920
01:29:55,198 --> 01:29:59,509
it's hard to have consistency and I also

1921
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:02,730
don't want to give my recipe away

1922
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:05,190
honestly that's that's been my challenge

1923
01:30:02,729 --> 01:30:06,659
it's like okay if I if I work with

1924
01:30:05,189 --> 01:30:08,939
somebody then all of a sudden they have

1925
01:30:06,659 --> 01:30:11,279
my recipe and and honestly I don't think

1926
01:30:08,939 --> 01:30:13,319
it'll turn out the same as how I when I

1927
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:15,389
make it there's something about the love

1928
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:18,929
and the magic that goes in right but but

1929
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:20,850
but it but it but it but but pre

1930
01:30:18,929 --> 01:30:22,050
regulated market you didn't have to work

1931
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:24,900
with some you could just do it yourself

1932
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:26,100
and sell it or give it away or sell it

1933
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:28,379
to your friends or whatever

1934
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:30,329
mm-hmm yep and I you know we used to do

1935
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:32,190
a lot of events these farmers market

1936
01:30:30,329 --> 01:30:33,448
things and I sold tons of it those

1937
01:30:32,189 --> 01:30:35,729
people love that stuff

1938
01:30:33,448 --> 01:30:38,399
but now I just kind of been holding back

1939
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:40,439
on it it's you know it's a challenge I

1940
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:42,960
one thing like Michael was talking about

1941
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:45,269
is like the contaminants right I know

1942
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:47,039
that my cannabis is clean but what about

1943
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:50,390
the other herbs that are going into

1944
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:53,550
there I haven't gone forward to test

1945
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:55,350
that in a concentrated level and that

1946
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:58,050
makes me nervous honestly they're

1947
01:30:55,350 --> 01:31:02,550
organic and so is the oils and all the

1948
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:05,579
things that go into it but what yeah and

1949
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:07,770
you know what are they testing for we're

1950
01:31:05,579 --> 01:31:10,260
we're testing for so many other things

1951
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:16,949
and cannabis that that we hadn't looked

1952
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:19,770
at before so my whole thing we've never

1953
01:31:16,948 --> 01:31:22,409
failed a test for any pesticide or heavy

1954
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:24,570
metal we infuse whole herbs that are

1955
01:31:22,409 --> 01:31:27,750
organically sourced from you know your

1956
01:31:24,569 --> 01:31:31,649
usual suspects star botanicals and

1957
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:40,770
frontier and we've never had a problem

1958
01:31:31,649 --> 01:31:47,238
so yes well the traps don't fall into

1959
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:47,239
the beeswax chaff that's the bad one

1960
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:57,050
just quickly uh last week or the week

1961
01:31:53,899 --> 01:31:59,029
before we had Wendy from space gems on

1962
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:01,970
and and she was talking about you know

1963
01:31:59,029 --> 01:32:04,609
having to find different sources for

1964
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:07,010
things given the lockdown coronavirus

1965
01:32:04,609 --> 01:32:09,619
and then her big fear was you know

1966
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:16,150
she'll get ding not for the extracted

1967
01:32:09,619 --> 01:32:23,199
cannabis oil but from adding these new

1968
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:27,679
organic you know non cannabis

1969
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:33,920
ingredients in her in her edibles yeah

1970
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:36,680
it's a concern for everyone so anyway if

1971
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:44,930
there are no last words I think we can

1972
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:47,570
wrap on that anyone know I was just

1973
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:50,119
gonna say support the small the small

1974
01:32:47,569 --> 01:32:53,479
companies I think everybody can agree on

1975
01:32:50,119 --> 01:32:55,970
that when you go into a dispensary go

1976
01:32:53,479 --> 01:33:01,279
for the brands that come straight from

1977
01:32:55,970 --> 01:33:03,530
the you know the source and and don't

1978
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:05,659
get these large brands you know I mean

1979
01:33:03,529 --> 01:33:10,550
they deserve the shelf space too of

1980
01:33:05,659 --> 01:33:12,380
course and and competition is wicked out

1981
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:13,850
there but the small farmers and this

1982
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:15,680
this is where all that product comes

1983
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:17,720
from for all these products as you can

1984
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:19,970
tell from this conversation so

1985
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,050
supporting those the small operators is

1986
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:26,619
is king

1987
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:30,260
thank you I also just wanted to say that

1988
01:33:26,619 --> 01:33:32,750
you know a lot of times in the industry

1989
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:34,640
people are like well how come the

1990
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:36,529
tobacco industry can do this or how come

1991
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:38,390
the alcohol industry can do this or the

1992
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:40,849
rights and the privileges of other

1993
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:46,280
established industries and a lot of

1994
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:49,970
those came from having incredibly strong

1995
01:33:46,279 --> 01:33:53,899
well-developed trade unions and lobbying

1996
01:33:49,970 --> 01:33:56,930
arms and as much as it is so difficult

1997
01:33:53,899 --> 01:34:00,738
to be a small operator it is critical

1998
01:33:56,930 --> 01:34:02,750
that we all band together through the

1999
01:34:00,738 --> 01:34:03,709
trade organizations and through the

2000
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:06,890
political acts

2001
01:34:03,710 --> 01:34:09,920
to try to carve a path for us to be able

2002
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:12,440
to survive because as we've seen there

2003
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,270
the agencies and the governments are not

2004
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:18,079
going to do the industry any favors that

2005
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:19,909
they do not fight tooth and nail for so

2006
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:23,000
that's one of the reasons why I've been

2007
01:34:19,908 --> 01:34:25,039
so involved in the state trade

2008
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:29,149
organization and trying to work with the

2009
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:31,310
local organizations to try to push that

2010
01:34:29,149 --> 01:34:34,219
stuff through because we really have to

2011
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:37,219
get those those those changes made to

2012
01:34:34,219 --> 01:34:39,469
carve out a place for the smaller

2013
01:34:37,219 --> 01:34:42,980
businesses as well because though it

2014
01:34:39,469 --> 01:34:44,569
can't just be the well-funded gigantic

2015
01:34:42,979 --> 01:34:47,049
companies who are sending their

2016
01:34:44,569 --> 01:34:50,210
lobbyists and to fight for their needs

2017
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:52,460
and there truly is power in numbers when

2018
01:34:50,210 --> 01:34:56,029
the smaller operators band together and

2019
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:57,739
and flex their political muscle so just

2020
01:34:56,029 --> 01:35:01,840
quickly on that can everyone give a

2021
01:34:57,738 --> 01:35:04,789
shout out to one or two local or

2022
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:06,980
statewide trade groups that they think

2023
01:35:04,789 --> 01:35:12,670
are doing a good job fighting on their

2024
01:35:06,979 --> 01:35:12,669
behalf Chea

2025
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:21,408
well locally we have the MCA which is

2026
01:35:17,448 --> 01:35:23,599
the Mendocino cannabis Association which

2027
01:35:21,408 --> 01:35:25,399
is you know had been three or four

2028
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:27,679
different organizations that have now

2029
01:35:25,399 --> 01:35:29,779
combined efforts seeing that everybody

2030
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:33,020
you know was fighting for the same cause

2031
01:35:29,779 --> 01:35:35,569
ultimately and that's you know might as

2032
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:37,820
well just combine efforts and make

2033
01:35:35,569 --> 01:35:41,329
things happen from that level I'm so

2034
01:35:37,819 --> 01:35:45,099
locally done that's been one of the best

2035
01:35:41,329 --> 01:35:48,289
advocates on on this small farmer side I

2036
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:55,010
think in LA it's it's all about the

2037
01:35:48,289 --> 01:35:56,869
retail scene Oh Mike go ahead Mike oh so

2038
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:58,489
I think down here in LA it's obviously

2039
01:35:56,869 --> 01:36:00,289
manufacturing is a big thing down here

2040
01:35:58,488 --> 01:36:03,769
but it's really the retail sector so

2041
01:36:00,289 --> 01:36:07,158
really for us it's kind of forgetting

2042
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:10,430
their name now a well there's you see be

2043
01:36:07,158 --> 01:36:16,409
a Southern California coalition

2044
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:18,960
Julie any others yeah welcome yeah I

2045
01:36:16,409 --> 01:36:21,149
think glocca was the what's the one but

2046
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:23,579
now they're part of Southern California

2047
01:36:21,149 --> 01:36:27,559
Coalition I believe in you CBA has been

2048
01:36:23,579 --> 01:36:32,850
a really strong advocate for retailers

2049
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:34,770
she CIA like I sit on the board of CIA

2050
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:37,070
that's a State Trade Organization

2051
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:39,630
California cannabis Industry Association

2052
01:36:37,069 --> 01:36:42,239
I've been deeply involved with them and

2053
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:44,760
they've also created a coalition of all

2054
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:47,369
of these groups and meet you know

2055
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:50,460
frequently because obviously there's a

2056
01:36:47,369 --> 01:36:52,409
lot of fantastic local trade

2057
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:54,359
organizations consumer trade

2058
01:36:52,409 --> 01:36:57,059
organizations obviously Americans for

2059
01:36:54,359 --> 01:37:00,659
safe access and California normal have

2060
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:03,240
been huge for for patient advocacy but

2061
01:37:00,659 --> 01:37:05,369
the the big magic is how do we get all

2062
01:37:03,239 --> 01:37:08,010
of these groups working together and

2063
01:37:05,369 --> 01:37:12,569
stay in the same thing because that's

2064
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:15,180
where you get that kind of force on par

2065
01:37:12,569 --> 01:37:17,699
with you know the work has been done for

2066
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:21,140
years for labor unions and even starting

2067
01:37:17,699 --> 01:37:26,039
to work more with those existing unions

2068
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:29,760
in terms of labor and other other areas

2069
01:37:26,039 --> 01:37:33,359
where it's like generally we're all kind

2070
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:36,630
of wanting much of the same things at

2071
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:38,579
core which is you know protections for

2072
01:37:36,630 --> 01:37:41,850
smaller operators protections for

2073
01:37:38,579 --> 01:37:44,489
workers protections for social equity

2074
01:37:41,850 --> 01:37:47,130
and keeping that a priority because

2075
01:37:44,489 --> 01:37:50,760
that's a lot of the reason this got

2076
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:54,900
pushed through in prop 64 was this idea

2077
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:57,720
of you know reinvestment in impacted

2078
01:37:54,899 --> 01:38:00,210
communities and and making a place both

2079
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:04,289
you know for the smaller operators but

2080
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:07,140
also for you know that social equity and

2081
01:38:04,289 --> 01:38:08,939
and I will say too just that you know

2082
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:10,770
the operators that you know the

2083
01:38:08,939 --> 01:38:12,779
regulations were written by people who

2084
01:38:10,770 --> 01:38:14,820
don't know didn't know anything about

2085
01:38:12,779 --> 01:38:16,559
cannabis and they're enforced by people

2086
01:38:14,819 --> 01:38:19,769
who don't know anything about cannabis

2087
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:24,239
really yeah it has always been the job

2088
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:26,670
of the industry itself to educate both

2089
01:38:24,238 --> 01:38:30,479
the legislators and the enforcement and

2090
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:33,449
the consumers and ourselves it's really

2091
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:38,299
our job to be the people who are is

2092
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:38,300
Laurie still the head of the BCC or some

2093
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:46,899
[Laughter]

2094
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:54,869
it's ironic I actually live in the city

2095
01:38:52,289 --> 01:39:02,029
where the BCC is headquartered and I

2096
01:38:54,869 --> 01:39:04,559
can't so Chelsea give us a local

2097
01:39:02,029 --> 01:39:07,469
organization that that you think

2098
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:16,980
represents the local Sacramento

2099
01:39:07,469 --> 01:39:19,439
community well okay I don't think we

2100
01:39:16,979 --> 01:39:20,939
mean I could be completely ignorant on

2101
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:23,939
this there was probably one of delivery

2102
01:39:20,939 --> 01:39:25,500
services that rings a bell there's

2103
01:39:23,939 --> 01:39:27,449
probably one for distributors there's

2104
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:31,079
definitely not one for manufacturers and

2105
01:39:27,449 --> 01:39:32,909
kind of as a whole the group that touts

2106
01:39:31,079 --> 01:39:35,130
itself as representing the industry

2107
01:39:32,909 --> 01:39:39,869
really only represents nine specific

2108
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:47,069
retailers and no one else so what I

2109
01:39:39,869 --> 01:39:50,090
really appreciate what what's the group

2110
01:39:47,069 --> 01:39:50,090
that touts itself

2111
01:39:56,460 --> 01:40:03,239
we call them the sac nine but it's nine

2112
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:06,630
retailers all owned by the same people

2113
01:40:03,238 --> 01:40:09,599
