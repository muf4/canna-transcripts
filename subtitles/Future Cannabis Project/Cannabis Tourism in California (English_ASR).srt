1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,339
my name is Brian Apple Garth I am the

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,809
founder and the executive director of

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,580
the CCTA we were established in 2017 and

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:14,609
we work to promote development of safe

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,089
and responsible cannabis tourism unify

6
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:19,859
the cannabis and the travel industries

7
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:22,469
advocate for enabling regulatory

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,929
environments and promote best practices

9
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:28,049
in the space with a unified cannabis

10
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:31,170
tourism voice our three core pillars are

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,698
advocacy education and networking so we

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,280
wanted to start out really talking about

13
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:37,318
cannabis tourism markets that currently

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,960
already exist and we took a look at

15
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:42,600
Amsterdam as well as Colorado and we

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,798
wanted to share three kind of data

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,109
points that we that we collected as far

18
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:50,728
as Amsterdam you can take a second and

19
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,079
kind of review these and read through

20
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:54,478
them and I'm going to speak to them here

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,280
while we do that but the Dutch tourist

22
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:59,248
information office reported that

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,649
essentially one in four people that

24
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:04,198
visit Amsterdam actually visit a

25
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,180
cannabis coffee shop so as part of the

26
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:10,649
destination experience and part of the

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,960
visitor draw for that market 10% of

28
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,600
those travelers actually willingly cite

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:19,109
that visiting a cannabis coffee shop in

30
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:22,109
Amsterdam was a primary reason for their

31
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,909
visitation to the destination when we

32
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:26,400
look at Colorado recently did some

33
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,159
research in the last two or three years

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,900
and when we look at Colorado they looked

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,519
at the kind of seasonally they looked at

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,850
both the winter season and the summer

37
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:38,340
season travel and across both it pretty

38
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:41,099
much average tout to between 15 and 16

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,620
percent of the cannabis interested

40
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:47,759
travelers that came to Colorado visited

41
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,510
a a marijuana dispensary store while

42
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,700
visiting 15 to 16 percent of visitors

43
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:56,280
also the demographic shift in the

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,439
cannabis motivated audience and they

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,349
noticed that that audience spends more

46
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,478
and stays longer in destinations which

47
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:06,359
really ties back to the economic impact

48
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:10,530
that tourism has and as normalization

49
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:12,840
grows will continue to grow so what is

50
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,210
cannabis tourism we really wanted to

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,770
pause kind of upfront here

52
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,570
and let us all get in the right kind of

53
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,780
mind space and start imagining what

54
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,489
cannabis toward tourism is currently

55
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,710
where it came from to now and what it's

56
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,719
going to be like going forward and to

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,879
really understand cannabis tourism in

58
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,990
California you have to start with

59
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:37,019
medical legalization in 1996 in 1996

60
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:39,150
proposition 215 passed and that was the

61
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,300
first time we saw the medical traveller

62
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,980
really start arriving in California now

63
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,870
cannabis played a vital role on the

64
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,879
front lines of the AIDS epidemic and

65
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,670
then other research came out about

66
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,759
glaucoma and even helping with nausea

67
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:55,709
and cancer treatments and this kind of

68
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,659
underground medical traveler started

69
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:01,110
arriving in California to access

70
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:03,689
cannabis it was a gray market trying to

71
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,520
quasi-legal market but that was the

72
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:09,319
first we saw kind of medical travelers

73
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:12,780
showing up and then between 1996 and

74
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,699
2018 you had this market that was the

75
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,030
medical marijuana market of California

76
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:18,780
called The Compassionate Use Act

77
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,400
compassionate use you may have heard

78
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,250
that term recently they're using that

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,469
term with coded 19 right now in creating

80
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,819
medications to address the pandemic it

81
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,310
was the same thing during the AIDS

82
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:33,900
epidemic so the compassionate huse Act

83
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,819
really positioned cannabis as what it

84
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,340
has been for for generations which is a

85
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,669
medical application and that routes

86
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,090
visitors to our state now between 1996

87
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,889
and 2018 in this quasi legal market you

88
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,780
had people started arriving as well that

89
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:50,339
were business minded they saw that

90
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,430
cannabis was on a trajectory to

91
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,810
eventually go legal and people started

92
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,860
showing up and wanting to learn more

93
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,599
about the industry in 2007 in Oakland

94
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,660
California actually Oaksterdam

95
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,789
University started which is kind of the

96
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:08,460
most well known cannabis college just

97
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:10,319
right here in Northern California so you

98
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,480
have this kind of business traveler or

99
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,969
even cannabis a food enthusiast that

100
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,069
relocated to California to get involved

101
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:21,060
in the medical marijuana market between

102
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:22,740
1996 and 2018 and then when you hit 2018

103
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,980
you have the adult use of medical

104
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,329
legalization or excuse me the adult use

105
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,099
market

106
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:30,288
which is essentially the recreational

107
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:33,348
cannabis market some refer to as and

108
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:35,149
this is where anyone 21 and up is able

109
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:39,500
to legally purchase and consume cannabis

110
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:41,689
it has regulations testing standards and

111
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,709
it really starts attracting more relief

112
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:48,379
for traveler now another interesting

113
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:50,598
pivot that happened in 2018 directly

114
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:52,610
ties into the efficacious testing

115
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:54,740
standard of the regulated cannabis

116
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,280
industry we have today

117
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,949
which essentially is as a tier of the

118
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,718
supply chain that ensures that the

119
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:05,689
products that you buy from a licensed

120
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:09,168
dispensary in California is tested four

121
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:10,759
parts per billion which is a very severe

122
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:13,609
testing standards so they know the

123
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,979
medicine is clean that there's no kind

124
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,590
of pollutants in it or or things that

125
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:21,709
are bad for you so you know even now the

126
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:24,049
medical tourism draw does exist it's not

127
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:26,329
fully recognized I know leisure is a lot

128
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,038
of the focus but this medical draw as

129
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:29,930
well especially with the testing

130
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:32,810
standards of the legal cannabis adult

131
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,538
use market continues to speak to the

132
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,709
medical traveler so it was important to

133
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:39,228
just kind of go through that process

134
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:41,239
from 96 to now to understand that

135
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:44,360
there's a medical traveler a business

136
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,509
traveler and a leisure traveler now this

137
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,669
list of cannabis tourism is just some of

138
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:52,250
the current offerings that exist in our

139
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:55,778
state you know obviously agritourism

140
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:58,370
cannabis is a plant it is a crop

141
00:05:55,778 --> 00:06:00,680
cannabis largely leans into wellness

142
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,509
which is why that is highlighted you

143
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,560
know cannabis is used as a tool to

144
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:08,449
promote well-being as long as the dosing

145
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,519
is correct and it's grown the right way

146
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,278
and it's clean it is very much in line

147
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:15,649
with wellness there's guided tours that

148
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:18,319
are operated daily from San Diego up to

149
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:21,079
Humble we have a handful of members that

150
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,060
are in that space of the CCTA a real

151
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,769
exciting evolution is the California

152
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,069
cannabis appellations there's been a lot

153
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:30,318
of great work done by the CDFA the

154
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:31,789
Mendocino Appalachians project the

155
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,069
International cannabis farmers

156
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:35,658
Association there's groups that are

157
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:38,240
working on building the cannabis

158
00:06:35,658 --> 00:06:39,459
appellations of California and right now

159
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,530
they're building

160
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:44,019
kind of the regulatory framework of what

161
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:46,989
that looks like you also have CBD

162
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:48,579
massage and spa services a really cool

163
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,829
product we have in California is the

164
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:53,079
Prohibition storytelling just like the

165
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:56,560
tunnels to you know the liquor and the

166
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:58,568
beer smuggling that happened we have

167
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,970
infused dining experiences where people

168
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,710
have curated dinners and their walk

169
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,419
through not only the food and how

170
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:06,339
cannabis is used in the food but where

171
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:09,129
it comes from and which appellation or

172
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:11,079
which part of the state that the flower

173
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,120
is grown and who grows it and how they

174
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:16,029
grow it and also how they cure it which

175
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,680
we'll get to later on you have cannabis

176
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:19,659
lounges popping up there's some in

177
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,509
Mendocino there's some in San Francisco

178
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,979
there's some that are down in in Palm

179
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,319
Springs there's one to open outside

180
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:28,149
Santa Barbara so you have these kind of

181
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,069
communal consumption spaces that are

182
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:32,288
emerging as well as a cafe that popped

183
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:35,168
up in West Hollywood and we are just at

184
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:37,060
the beginning and really frankly need to

185
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:39,490
move quicker with creating consumption

186
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,079
areas for people and communicating

187
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,579
around what that means and where people

188
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,829
can use cannabis confidently you know

189
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:45,879
it's safe and legal

190
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:48,430
obviously with cannabis you have guided

191
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,848
pairings and tastings you have creative

192
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,470
kind of endeavors like cuff and paint

193
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:55,839
visiting a cannabis shop just like the

194
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,490
Amsterdam data point showed people are

195
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,709
curious to actually go into a legal

196
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,468
retail experience and see what that

197
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:04,839
feels like and know and understand it

198
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:06,668
immersive educated you know in this

199
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,319
early phase a lot of people are focused

200
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:11,319
on education and wanting more

201
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,259
information around cannabis Hampton CBD

202
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:17,829
so being kind of over investing on

203
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:19,598
education for people is as important you

204
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:21,639
also have to connoisseur which goes into

205
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,889
a whole line of concentrates and other

206
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,918
kind of products with cannabis people

207
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:29,050
get really geeky about kind of what type

208
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:31,269
of concentrate it is how it's sourced

209
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:35,259
there's live resin there's what is the

210
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:36,939
efficacy is a single source and cannabis

211
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:38,918
one reason it's so complicated is

212
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,209
because it really tentacles out and do a

213
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,528
lot of different products and different

214
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:44,349
and it speaks to a lot of different

215
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:45,970
audiences in California too we have the

216
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,430
cannabis movement that happened right

217
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,440
here for medical legalization which

218
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:52,088
really you know we already have that

219
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,430
tourism asset which is the heat

220
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:56,920
Berry in San Francisco and that talks

221
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:58,508
about that cannabis story was not told

222
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:00,429
as the story of the back-to-the-land

223
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:02,889
movement and the migration up north

224
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:05,289
and living off the land in communities

225
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:07,299
off the grid and it's as compelling and

226
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:10,269
interesting so when you start learning

227
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:12,159
about you know the the movement of

228
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,169
cannabis including what happened in San

229
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,639
Francisco with the epidemic which was

230
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:17,979
the platform that allowed it to be

231
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,049
medical legalized you start kind of

232
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,879
seeing this California story emerge of

233
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:24,008
marginalized groups and cannabis just

234
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,720
threaded throughout it also kind of

235
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,370
dates back to the beat next so there's

236
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,829
an opportunity to breathe some new life

237
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,009
into that storytelling as well and we

238
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:35,349
all know how important storytelling is

239
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:38,470
to for marketing to bring people here

240
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,629
and want to experience something of

241
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,550
course that ties into culture and last

242
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:45,069
but not least is events you know the

243
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:48,240
Emerald cup which is one of the if not

244
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:52,208
the premier cannabis event in California

245
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,769
in in December will draw it will bring

246
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:56,979
in about seventeen to twenty million

247
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:59,799
dollars in direct spending to Sonoma

248
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,659
County and there's a big opportunity for

249
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,498
cannabis events to be an economic driver

250
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:07,028
for destinations all right this slides

251
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:08,949
just more inspirational kind of

252
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:10,778
photographs really kind of showing you

253
00:10:08,948 --> 00:10:13,359
the diversity that cannabis and CBD

254
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:15,068
tourism has you know upper left corner

255
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,709
there you have Dennis Peron and brownie

256
00:10:15,068 --> 00:10:19,149
Mary that's a that's a story in itself

257
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,708
that's but that's part of the culture

258
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,318
and the historical movement and

259
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:27,219
storytelling you know obviously yoga

260
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:29,498
meditation mindfulness spa treatment CBD

261
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,110
infused massages you see the two

262
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:34,600
gentlemen taking a selfie in a cannabis

263
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,699
cultivation area and then of course the

264
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,629
photo on the right with a group enjoying

265
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:42,609
kind of a family-style fine dining

266
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:45,428
coerced meal that's probably cannabis

267
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:48,639
infused or CBD infused where you have

268
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:50,620
the chef as well as a Somali a there to

269
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,480
walk them through the experience and

270
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,539
make sure they understand the dosing and

271
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,990
the effects and use it kind of as

272
00:10:54,539 --> 00:11:01,208
entertainment an educational tool and it

273
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,678
can be inhalation or non inflation so

274
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,328
we'll get to that as well but there's a

275
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:05,579
lot of different types of products and

276
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:09,269
ways to curate

277
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,830
all right great so I'm sure most of us

278
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,710
have heard of the Emerald triangle

279
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,000
region of Northern California

280
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:18,060
so the Emerald triangle is a three

281
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,519
County region and it sits north of

282
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,159
Sonoma it sits Humboldt Mendocino and

283
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,649
Trinity County and it's really famous

284
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,809
for world-class cannabis it's a region

285
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:29,819
where small farmers have been perfecting

286
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:32,339
their cannabis craft for generations not

287
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,100
only underground but many of them off

288
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,200
the grid and really people that value

289
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,200
low impact on the land so there's really

290
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,390
interesting methods of Agriculture and

291
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,009
farming that have come out of the

292
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,750
underground cannabis community that

293
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:47,819
they're extremely excited to build into

294
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,230
the tourist experience get people's

295
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,600
hands in the dirt and teach them how to

296
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,279
create these ecosystems that are built

297
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,320
on biodiversity and regenerative

298
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,679
agriculture and these other terms that

299
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,290
are part of the cannabis cultivation

300
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,769
culture and I want to thank Flo Khanna

301
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:06,750
Flo Khanna is the largest distributor in

302
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:08,549
California and they support these legacy

303
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,200
small farmers okay I'm going to move on

304
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:13,370
to the next slide which is cannabis

305
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,410
consumption and dosing cannabis 2.0

306
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,750
cannabis has come a long way

307
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:20,519
so really cannabis 2.0 goes beyond on

308
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,259
the inhalation style of consumption

309
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,120
which is still a core part of the

310
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,549
cannabis industry in the cannabis

311
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,860
culture but in this new evolution

312
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:31,620
there's all kinds of products this is

313
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,570
just a simple slide showing that you

314
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,580
know for tourism for tourists and

315
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,260
visitors to our state you know there's

316
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,759
gonna be many options of how they're

317
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:40,439
able to consume cannabis there's

318
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,289
drinkables there's edibles

319
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,390
there's topicals there's transdermal

320
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:47,939
patches there's intimacy products

321
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,549
there's sleep chocolates there's all

322
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,530
certain there's all different kinds of

323
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:54,240
products that are largely based in

324
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:56,069
effect and that's what really makes

325
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,100
cannabis interesting is it's an effect

326
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,379
based product so you know comparable not

327
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,420
necessarily to the buzz of wine but if

328
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,850
cannabis has its own quote unquote buzz

329
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:09,319
that has a different feel and it can

330
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:12,840
really lean into creativity or intimacy

331
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,460
or other effects feelings and then it's

332
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,590
really about getting the dosing correct

333
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,360
and every day we're getting better and

334
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,850
better on the dosing and this is largely

335
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,949
with

336
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,509
THC meal molecule that that's a little

337
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:25,629
more controversial because it's a

338
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:27,539
psychoactive component of cannabis but

339
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:30,100
there's many different dosing options

340
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:32,740
there's different kinds of products and

341
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,110
also the packaging is going mainstream

342
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,720
so as you see in this photo there's all

343
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,389
sorts of packages and brands you have

344
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,060
brands like Francis Ford Coppola like

345
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:44,799
Lagunitas beer that are now rolling out

346
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:47,018
their cannabis lines so the

347
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,669
sophistication is increasing and it's

348
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:51,149
gonna make it more accessible because

349
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:54,909
it's relatable to the new consumer

350
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:56,889
alright great so this is a simple slide

351
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:59,679
is globe Trender which essentially does

352
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,000
travel trend forecasts and it just shows

353
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,559
that there's been quite a lot there's

354
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,690
been quite a bit of media coverage the

355
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,508
past kind of twelve months to two years

356
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:09,790
around cannabis and CBD tourism and how

357
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:13,449
it's becoming a more sophisticated kind

358
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:15,818
of destination product that's appealing

359
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:17,889
to luxury leaning travelers as well as

360
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:20,379
budget travelers speaks to a lot of

361
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:23,169
different audiences they ranked number

362
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:25,149
nine for the 2020 travel trend forecasts

363
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:28,000
we've also seen cannabis tourism be

364
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:29,769
covered in Forbes wine enthusiasts the

365
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,169
Travel Channel and other mainstream

366
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:34,000
outlets that just shows that that it's

367
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:35,769
becoming further and further normalized

368
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,429
and it's something that we should look

369
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:41,019
at with more attention as we are in our

370
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:43,359
third year of legalization here in

371
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:45,399
California and that's also a close-up of

372
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,649
a cannabis flower so cannabis is

373
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,870
actually a flowering plant and there's

374
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,318
lots of different kinds of cultivars or

375
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,698
varietals of cannabis there's high CBD

376
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:58,149
there's ones that are kind of more

377
00:14:54,698 --> 00:15:00,039
balanced like 10% 10% CBD to THC and

378
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:02,740
then there's ones that go through the

379
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:05,318
roof up to 30 plus percent of THC count

380
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,180
and yet again these cultivars just like

381
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:10,088
varietals a wine has like different

382
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:12,278
balance taste mouthfeel these cultivars

383
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:15,040
of cannabis which is the you know kind

384
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,720
of the Simmons a the word for cannabis

385
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,389
cultivar is like synonym to wine

386
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,009
varietal is it really leans into

387
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:22,448
different kinds of effects as well as

388
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:24,818
smells so it's going to be a really

389
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:27,338
complex plan and really fun to curate

390
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:29,490
those experiences and tourism next slide

391
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:29,490
please

392
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,139
alright so the CCT a really we live at

393
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:37,389
the intersection of the tourism industry

394
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:40,149
in the cannabis industry and we really

395
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:42,579
work to build bridges and since we

396
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,318
started in 2017 the goal is to really

397
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:46,028
get a seat at the table with the travel

398
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:49,418
industry of the state and start

399
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:51,698
educating and normalizing and just

400
00:15:49,418 --> 00:15:54,038
working toward cannabis being understood

401
00:15:51,698 --> 00:15:55,678
so different destinations and

402
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:58,958
stakeholders could figure out how

403
00:15:55,678 --> 00:16:00,938
cannabis hemp or CBD could fit into

404
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:04,149
their destination and speak to an

405
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:06,188
audience so this is two kind of

406
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:07,989
high-level definitions the tourism

407
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:10,389
industry is travel for pleasure or

408
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:12,160
business it's the practice of touring in

409
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:13,839
the business of attracting accommodating

410
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,578
and entertaining visitors travelers and

411
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,079
tourists and the cannabis industry

412
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:19,028
refers to all activities and

413
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,278
professionals that are involved directly

414
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:24,009
or an ancillary role to the legal

415
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,409
production transport state sale and

416
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:27,879
consumption of cannabis or hemp as well

417
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:30,818
as the product services and experiences

418
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:32,798
derived from or centered around them so

419
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:36,928
the convergence of these two industries

420
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:39,129
is where the CCTA lives we engaged

421
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:41,198
consistently with the California hotel

422
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:43,688
lodging association Cal Travel

423
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:46,178
Association visit California you know I

424
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:48,969
consider those three groups to really

425
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:51,938
kind of carry the torch for California

426
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,069
tourism and we are a resource to them as

427
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:56,108
well as our members and helping build

428
00:16:54,068 --> 00:17:00,219
bridges and creating opportunities and

429
00:16:56,109 --> 00:17:02,739
educating so we can so we can understand

430
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,259
what we have with cannabis in California

431
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:08,318
as a California destination asset for

432
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:09,759
market to market so I wanted to speak a

433
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,990
little bit more to the difference

434
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:15,970
between Cal travel and visit California

435
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:20,259
and the California Hotel and Lodging

436
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:22,298
Association so the California Hotel and

437
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:24,490
Lodging Association basically helps

438
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:26,798
address the diverse needs of the hotel

439
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,679
and hospitality industry in the state of

440
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:32,288
California visit California is the

441
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,960
marketing organization that works to

442
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:36,490
drive visitation to California it's

443
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,788
basically kind of an economic

444
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:41,349
development vehicle with tourism and

445
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:44,589
then the California Travel Association

446
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:46,509
is the United voice

447
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:48,759
the California's travel and tourism

448
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:49,839
industry and their mission is to protect

449
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,298
in advance

450
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,749
the travel and tourism industries

451
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:58,210
interest so there's a lot of advocacy

452
00:17:54,749 --> 00:18:01,538
that happens under Cal Travel so for

453
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,569
example last year we we actually were in

454
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:07,929
Sacramento as part of the Lobby Day or

455
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:10,178
the advocacy day with Cal travel and the

456
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:12,249
year before that the CCTA actually

457
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,139
showed up independently and took

458
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:15,730
meetings to make people aware that we

459
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:18,998
were here and this is what our mission

460
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,499
was okay so we have a few more data

461
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:22,690
points here this is really focused

462
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:25,240
around California's tourism industry and

463
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,009
how important it is you know nearly a

464
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,499
hundred and forty five billion and

465
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:32,950
travel related spending in 2019 in

466
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:34,778
California you know another important

467
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,940
data point here is the fourth one down

468
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:39,099
you'll notice that six out of every ten

469
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,740
dollars spent in visitor destinations

470
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:44,349
was attributable to out-of-state or

471
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,329
international visitation so essentially

472
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:48,219
this shows the case that tourism is an

473
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:51,069
economic driver and incredibly relevant

474
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,548
for the state of California all right

475
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:53,499
wonderful

476
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:57,249
now here's California's cannabis

477
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:58,569
industry and why this is relevant so you

478
00:18:57,249 --> 00:19:03,778
know a couple other data points

479
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:08,138
retail sales grew from 2.5 to 3 point 1

480
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:11,079
billion in 2019 and the traditional

481
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:11,979
markets sold an estimated 8.1 billion in

482
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:14,710
2019

483
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,028
now that statistic is interesting

484
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,440
because the traditional market is

485
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:19,359
essentially the black market

486
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,820
another sensitivity around the use of

487
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,258
that word but that shows the gap and

488
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:24,878
kind of the battle that's upon the

489
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:27,399
regulated market to really try to

490
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:30,009
capture more consumers and bring them

491
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:32,678
into licensed retail shops buying safe

492
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:34,419
tested medicine and the CCT a really

493
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:37,809
works to steward that as well and

494
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:39,340
support the regulated market another

495
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:41,980
data point here is the cannabis industry

496
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:46,178
impact would be nearly 10 billion by

497
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:48,190
2022 and cannabis and hemp derived CVD

498
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:50,919
products combined could reach 20 billion

499
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,080
in sales by 2024 and it's one of the

500
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,028
fastest growing segments so this just

501
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,220
shows the economic relevance of the

502
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,829
cannabis and

503
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,720
CBD and hemp industry now I want to

504
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:02,759
point out that CBD is an interesting

505
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,700
term because it really overlaps between

506
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,980
the hemp and the cannabis industry and

507
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,950
you have different types of CBD products

508
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,750
from full-spectrum to broad spectrum to

509
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,490
isolate and I've even heard live

510
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,730
spectrum is a new category that's

511
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,529
growing so you know the cannabis

512
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:23,308
industry and the hemp industry along

513
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:25,259
with the CBD craze is continues to trend

514
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:27,658
up and having that merged in with

515
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:29,700
California cannabis tourism again is our

516
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:32,789
mission and something worth discussing

517
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,870
and moving forward so you know this

518
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:36,569
slide I really wanted just to

519
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:38,279
acknowledge that tourism in California

520
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,200
and travel there's really an ecosystem

521
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,970
that is established for market to market

522
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,890
including throughout the state

523
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:48,839
you have hotels attractions restaurants

524
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,700
you have you know everything from Airbnb

525
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:53,038
ease Bed and Breakfasts do you have

526
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,529
different types of museums and there's

527
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,690
certain markets and certain operators or

528
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:59,428
businesses within those markets we're

529
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,038
speaking to the visitation and the

530
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:04,019
tourists to their market is a core part

531
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,808
of their business model and we're in a

532
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:11,339
phase right now where cannabis operators

533
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:14,009
that understand this opportunity 10:10

534
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:16,918
can can build bridges and educate and

535
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:19,769
reach out and find their spot within

536
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:22,590
that tourism ecosystem which which is

537
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:24,359
already in place you'll notice to the

538
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:26,519
right of the slide you know there's a

539
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:27,629
there's a kind of a portion that shows

540
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,519
the DMOS

541
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,590
which is the destination the destination

542
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,720
TM o stands for destination marketing

543
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:36,449
organization and essentially each

544
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,929
destination from San Francisco to Palm

545
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:42,150
Springs that San Diego to Oxnard has

546
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:44,190
their destination pillars of kind of

547
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,350
what they have a position as a

548
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,509
destination for travelers and the

549
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:50,519
question is how is cannabis and CBD in

550
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:54,210
Hampton it exists market by market

551
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:56,908
throughout the state and then the DMO is

552
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:59,009
largely similar to what visit California

553
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:01,860
does for the state of California the

554
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:04,619
demos in each market or the CVB's they

555
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:05,879
try to attract visitation by marketing

556
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:08,308
within their pillars of their

557
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,299
destination to get people to visit and

558
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:12,720
spend money and

559
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:14,519
experience the culture and come visit so

560
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,169
I just wanted to lay that out and really

561
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:18,569
paint the picture that with lounge's

562
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:21,480
deliveries as well as cannabis shops and

563
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:23,908
of course poor companies and infused

564
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,528
dinners and the list we had prior you

565
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,600
know there's a lot of ways to plug in

566
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:30,019
for people who are interested in being

567
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:33,089
part of this cannabis tourism evolution

568
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:35,700
we're going to dive now into the core

569
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:37,798
pillar of the CCTA is advocacy so this

570
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,350
is an advocacy update it's the last

571
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:44,940
three kind of initiatives that we worked

572
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:47,128
on the most recent one is we signed on

573
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,639
to a funding request that was

574
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:52,349
spearheaded by Cal travel which is

575
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:54,538
basically requesting 45 million

576
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:57,238
allocation for Vista California to run a

577
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:59,908
marketing campaign as the state reopens

578
00:22:57,239 --> 00:23:02,190
and gets Californians back traveling and

579
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:03,809
back to work so I think that was

580
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,570
actually submitted yesterday or today

581
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:08,668
and the CCTA is right there alongside

582
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:12,210
the other kind of tourism stakeholders

583
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:15,899
throughout the state a few months back

584
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,429
prior to kovin we we put some energy

585
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:23,038
into trying to breathe some new life

586
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:24,778
into SV 625 now SSP 625 originally it

587
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,898
was a bill that would permit cannabis

588
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:30,089
charter party carriers provided that the

589
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:32,099
vehicle was equipped with appropriate

590
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:34,798
ventilation standards to assure that the

591
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:37,319
drivers are not exposed to secondhand

592
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:40,558
smoke so it was an effort to allow the

593
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:43,528
inhalation component of the tourist

594
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,898
cannabis tourism to exist on a vehicle

595
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:47,669
and there are four companies that were

596
00:23:45,898 --> 00:23:50,638
kind of first movers in the market that

597
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:52,799
invested in retrofitting or building out

598
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:55,469
their vehicles to accommodate this as it

599
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,628
was written which is now it's on shaky

600
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,999
ground and all but off the table so

601
00:23:57,628 --> 00:24:01,558
we're gonna pick that back up once we're

602
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:04,470
past coated but we see an opportunity

603
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:07,319
here to have some of the operators who

604
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,118
are members of the CTA to potentially

605
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,009
put forth an option of having them

606
00:24:09,118 --> 00:24:12,868
grandfathered in in a certain limited

607
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:14,639
number of people who are operating prior

608
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:17,009
and then also opening up the

609
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:18,868
conversation of you know what about

610
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:20,110
drinkables what about edibles what about

611
00:24:18,868 --> 00:24:21,699
these other

612
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:23,919
consumption methods that aren't

613
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,080
inhalation based and being able to use

614
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,230
those on carriers so those are that's SP

615
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:31,589
six or six twenty five speaks to that

616
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:35,670
also recently the CCTA

617
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:38,349
submitted comments around the proposed

618
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:41,019
Appalachians cannabis Appalachians

619
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:43,119
so the CDFA put those out it went

620
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:45,579
through a comment period we had three

621
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,949
comments that we submitted one was a two

622
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:49,899
are based system essentially we

623
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,819
recommended reconsidering creating a

624
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,759
structure that was more deeply focused

625
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:57,549
on terroir including the unique impact

626
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,829
of the Earth's Sun and air and and the

627
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:02,649
differentiating factors in cannabis

628
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:05,319
cultivars the second point was labeling

629
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:07,930
and we recommended that an appellation

630
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:11,439
in a county of a county of origin be

631
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:13,180
prominently displayed on a label working

632
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,009
toward marketing and really thinking of

633
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,330
it in an international market and what

634
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:19,150
does that sound like when people would

635
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:22,569
want to buy the you know the best cap

636
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:26,440
California bud or pot or cannabis from

637
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:28,539
humble or Mancino trendy county and then

638
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,549
the third comment we submitted was about

639
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:33,639
the cost of petition and the amendment

640
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:36,069
fee essentially it was twenty thousand

641
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,320
plus dollars for the petition the

642
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:40,450
appellation petitioned and then it was

643
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,779
ten thousand plus dollars to simply make

644
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:46,750
an amendment every single time so we

645
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:49,359
came in and basically stated that we

646
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,309
feel the fees were excessive that could

647
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,229
they have created unfair financial

648
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:56,289
barriers essentially for the small

649
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:58,210
legacy cannabis farmers and that we

650
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:00,519
recommended that the fees be lowered or

651
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:04,680
reconsidered depending on kind of a

652
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:07,269
sliding scale on how big the outfit was

653
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,310
also I'll get to this later but we have

654
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:11,799
set up a new flap channel that you're

655
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:14,019
all going to be invited to that has this

656
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:15,460
these comments and a lot of the other

657
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:17,200
documents that I'll be walking through

658
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,750
where you can look at them in greater

659
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,170
detail alright the second pillar is

660
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:24,819
networking of the CCTA so essentially we

661
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,830
try to foster an environment where our

662
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:29,769
members can network together

663
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:31,569
they can network with the you know with

664
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:34,359
with other organizations things like

665
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:35,710
that opportunities when I first

666
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:38,379
envisioned the CCTA

667
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:41,019
it was 50% membership from the travel

668
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:43,419
tourism industry 50% membership kind of

669
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:44,919
from the cannabis industry and trying to

670
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:46,630
have a blend so we could have really

671
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,940
great conversations and have different

672
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:52,990
points of view and be educating each

673
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:57,519
other in a very reciprocal way all right

674
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:59,679
I'd like to welcome Amanda Ryman as our

675
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:02,319

of the CCTA she's the VP of community

677
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,879

680
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:13,629
my pleasure I'm happy to be here and

681
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:15,729
thanks everyone for joining I have to

682
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:23,409
say watching who's all in the room it's

683
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:25,089
like so many people that I love right on

684
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,919
hey Amanda will you just kind of give

685
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:29,918
some background you've been the movement

686
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,200
a long time you know I just love you to

687
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,240
give this audience is largely from the

688
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,919
travel industry as well so if you could

689
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,500
just kind of give some context of who

690
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,538
you are and your role and and the kind

691
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,278
of the cannabis movement to now and then

692
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:45,609
what you do for Flo kana

693
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:47,500
that'd be great sure so I'm a public

694
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:49,569
health researcher and social worker by

695
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,490
training and I started studying the

696
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:53,678
cannabis industry and movement when I

697
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:57,579
was getting my PhD at Berkeley in Social

698
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,340
Welfare back in 2005 so I did my

699
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:02,230
doctoral dissertation on how medical

700
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:04,569
cannabis dispensaries were operating as

701
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:06,089
community health service providers and I

702
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:08,859
think that that's important because

703
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:10,959
folks who don't remember or weren't

704
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:12,819
really involved back then the

705
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,569
dispensaries really played a huge role

706
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:18,099
in community connection and I think that

707
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:21,278
that's important when we talk about

708
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:25,329
tourism now because it's really what is

709
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:27,609
at the heart of California cannabis so I

710
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:29,528
think that that is that was something

711
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:31,449
that I noticed early on was very very

712
00:28:29,528 --> 00:28:35,079
unique about the California cannabis

713
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:37,090
atmosphere and then after I graduated I

714
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,829
continued to teach at Berkeley but I

715
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:39,990
started working for Berkeley patients

716
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:41,609
group

717
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,940
as their head of research and patient

718
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:46,079
services to continue to do research

719
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:49,139
looking at things like cannabis

720
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:52,730
substitution and then they got I shut

721
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:57,089
down by the federal government in 2012

722
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:58,798
yeah and so then I I left and I went to

723
00:28:57,089 --> 00:29:00,480
work for the drug policy Alliance as

724
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,778
their manager of marijuana law and

725
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,230
policy and you know my focus has always

726
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:09,749
been the relationship between cannabis

727
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:12,028
and everything else around it it's

728
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:13,200
really the relationships that I'm most

729
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:15,839
interested in

730
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,399
so after legalization I had an

731
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,009
opportunity to move up to the Emerald

732
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:22,979
triangle to Mendocino County to work

733
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:26,099
with flow kana on creating centralized

734
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,230
distribution for small independently

735
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:31,138
owned cannabis farms up in this region

736
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,360
so again the community aspect was really

737
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:35,459
taking front and center which is my jam

738
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,888
I mean that's what I love to do so I

739
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,139
came up here to work in community

740
00:29:37,888 --> 00:29:41,969
development and again you know not just

741
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:44,219
the cannabis but the cannabis and

742
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:47,249
everything else and I think that's why

743
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,929
the tourism is so interesting to me

744
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:52,579
because it's really an opportunity to

745
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:55,889
bridge cannabis with so many other

746
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:59,069
wonderful things about California that I

747
00:29:55,888 --> 00:30:04,019
think can really be a unique draw for

748
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:05,609
folks thanks Amanda so you know the

749
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:09,118
Emerald triangle region of Northern

750
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:11,579
California is often spoke about like

751
00:30:09,118 --> 00:30:13,859
it's the Bordeaux right the Bordeaux of

752
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:16,378
cannabis and it's a world class

753
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:19,288
producing region it's a place of source

754
00:30:16,378 --> 00:30:21,298
and what role do you feel like this

755
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:23,368
region will play in the California

756
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:26,038
tourism landscape in the future

757
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:29,519
well I think that there's kind of a two

758
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:32,669
stage outcome there at first is what we

759
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:36,179
could do when California can only

760
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:38,549
produce and consume weed in California

761
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:40,950
right so there's definitely a barrier to

762
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:42,418
realizing the full potential of the

763
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:46,019
Emerald triangle in the appellation

764
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:48,389
systems until we can ship it outside of

765
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:51,028
California so I think that you know step

766
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,740
one is the develop relations which you

767
00:30:51,028 --> 00:30:53,819
know we're working on and then it's

768
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,529
really thinking about the

769
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:58,349
brand of the Emerald triangle as a

770
00:30:55,529 --> 00:31:00,809
region so thinking about not just the

771
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:03,599
individual counties but the ethos of the

772
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:06,509
area and how we turn that into a brand

773
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,490
and then I think you know during that

774
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:11,190
brand out there and marketing that brand

775
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,049
is gonna be really important we're gonna

776
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,799
people are gonna want to come here to

777
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:17,940
experience what's so unique about

778
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:20,190
cannabis production in the Emerald

779
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,840
triangle along with everything else the

780
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,529
Emerald triangle has to offer which is

781
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:27,990
so unique so there is a potential there

782
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:30,690
but I think you know until we can

783
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,579
actually share the product with people

784
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:36,150
in Michigan and with people in Nebraska

785
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:38,309
and with people in Virginia were only

786
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:41,519
going to be able to capitalize on a

787
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:46,409
small portion of the full potential of

788
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,970
the Emerald triangle region wonderful so

789
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,130
is the culture and history of the

790
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:53,160
California cannabis movement important

791
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:55,950
to include as part of the visitor

792
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,900
experience for people interested in

793
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:01,230
experiencing California cannabis and if

794
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:03,540
so why yes of course I mean the culture

795
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,450
in the history of cannabis in California

796
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:08,220
is a cornerstone of cannabis tourism and

797
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,900
without it honestly I feel like a

798
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,180
tourism experience would be pretty much

799
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:14,880
an empty shell and there's a couple

800
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:17,640
reasons for this one we owe it to them

801
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,350
we owe it to the folks who stuck their

802
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,910
necks out and got arrested and put

803
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:23,490
everything on the line for us to have a

804
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:25,710
cannabis industry so having a discussion

805
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,890
about cannabis in California without

806
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:30,480
including them and their stories I would

807
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,310
never I mean that would be very

808
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,750
disrespectful to people who have worked

809
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:35,700
so hard to make this happen

810
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,799
and then I also think that from a

811
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,779
consumer point of view connection and

812
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:42,480
story is what makes something real for

813
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:45,329
someone and I grew up in Chicago and I

814
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,099
grew up going to themes there the Museum

815
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:49,679
of Science and Industry in the Field

816
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:52,049
Museum and what really brought those

817
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,779
museums to life were experiential

818
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:58,129
opportunities so opportunities to have

819
00:32:54,779 --> 00:33:00,329
visceral context and visceral

820
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,370
experiences that really brought the

821
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:05,730
history to life and it connected with

822
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:07,529
you on a very personal way and I feel

823
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,089
like and here in California what we

824
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:11,879
have that a lot of states don't have

825
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:16,559
when it comes to cannabis history is

826
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:19,020
that really big emotional connection to

827
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,559
the plant and what is has meant so to

828
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:24,569
have a tourism industry in California

829
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:27,960
that doesn't include opportunities to

830
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:30,299
learn about the past isn't again doing a

831
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,190
service to what it means to be involved

832
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,740
in cannabis in California and it's also

833
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:36,900
losing out on a really big opportunity

834
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:39,240
to change hurts and minds about cannabis

835
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,280
so one of the opportunities I've always

836
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,950
seen for cannabis tourism in California

837
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,559
is to invite people from prohibition

838
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:51,180
states to come here and experience

839
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:54,450
cannabis in a beautiful spiritual highly

840
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,549
connected safe way and that the cannabis

841
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,650
tourism industry in California was

842
00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:01,139
almost a gatekeeper to that experience

843
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,820
and that folks could come here and they

844
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,980
could just eat you know a thousand

845
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:06,839
milligrams of THC and have a marine Dowd

846
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,570
experience and be in their hotel room

847
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,250
freaking out and go back to Iowa and

848
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,179
talk about how legalization was the

849
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:16,199
worst thing that's ever happened

850
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:18,599
anyplace or they could come and go to a

851
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:20,428
beautiful farm and get to put their

852
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,489
hands in the dirt and get to have a

853
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:26,490
lightly infused meal and get to tour

854
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:29,519
some lounges and you know really learn

855
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:31,500
about cannabis and go back to you know

856
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,509
wherever they're from and talk about

857
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,668
what a wonderful experience it was and

858
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:37,610
question why they have prohibition in

859
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:41,099
their state and that's a really powerful

860
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:43,470
tool when people feel it inside and

861
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:46,199
that's what sharing the culture of

862
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:49,889
cannabis in California will do with

863
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:51,299
tourism if we do it right I agree I

864
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,039
can't tell you how many stories I've

865
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,350
heard people just coming and

866
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,029
accidentally taking too much because the

867
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:58,769
communication and the kind of

868
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,050
information campaigns just aren't there

869
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:03,480
yet and really hoping that we can move

870
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,460
that forward here in 2020 and 2021 to

871
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,800
give visitors the informations they need

872
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,150
to be able to have that right dose and

873
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,240
that right experience here if they

874
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:15,389
decide to use THC and go beyond the CBD

875
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:17,909
Massage authority doing and so about

876
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:19,539
flow kana you know you guys have a great

877
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:22,779
property in South Bend

878
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:24,550
it's kind of a gateway to this region so

879
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,680
I'm curious what the vision is was for

880
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:29,140
the future of tourism you know according

881
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:30,579
to flow Khanna and what they intend how

882
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:33,219
they intend to reach visitors that are

883
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:34,210
coming to our state well I you know as

884
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:36,039
we're gonna talk about in the next

885
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,690
section around kovat you know there's

886
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:39,279
definitely some reimagining that's

887
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,690
happening when we think about what the

888
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,550
future of tourism is going to be at

889
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,619
least in the short to medium term and

890
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,150
what kind of experiences people are

891
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:48,969
gonna want to have and you know before I

892
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:50,230
talk more about folk Ana's vision one of

893
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:52,629
the things I've been doing recently is

894
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,820
doing interviews with tourism operators

895
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:56,890
in the space to get a better sense of

896
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,019
how they're pivoting during COBIT and

897
00:35:56,889 --> 00:36:01,319
what they see for the future and even

898
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:03,670
though you know finance is definitely a

899
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,470
concern and a barrier moving forward

900
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:08,409
what I'm hearing is almost a bigger

901
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:10,359
barrier is the psychology around travel

902
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:11,980
and what people are gonna be comfortable

903
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,450
with and what they're not going to be

904
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,699
comfortable with and so there's a big

905
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:17,619
conversation to be had we talked about

906
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:19,869
the future of tourism about what is

907
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:22,299
gonna feed into people's fears and what

908
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:23,619
is going to make them feel better and so

909
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,000
one of the things we have going for us

910
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:26,980
in the Emerald triangle of course are

911
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,650
these beautiful wide-open spaces

912
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,329
we're not a congested area there's lots

913
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,000
of room for people to hike and for

914
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:36,069
people to camp and still maintain safe

915
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,500
social distancing so all of that being

916
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:40,300
said and we think about the future of

917
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,880
tourism and what socata would like to

918
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,769
see you know I think we are of the

919
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,450
mindset you know come for the cannabis

920
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:48,820
stay for the regenerative agriculture

921
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:50,980
like we see this as an opportunity to

922
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:53,769
hook people in with an interest in

923
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,389
cannabis and in you know seeing cannabis

924
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:57,789
farms but then using that as an

925
00:36:55,389 --> 00:37:00,219
opportunity to talk about sustainable

926
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:03,449
and environmentally sound cultivation of

927
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:07,119
food in general and of plants in general

928
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:08,829
Mendocino County banned GMOs a long time

929
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,650
ago they were the first place to take

930
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:13,840
that step the fact that they have capped

931
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,210
their farms at 10,000 square feet

932
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:19,269
although that might change you know has

933
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:21,670
shown what they view as special about

934
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:23,469
the way people farm here so I you know

935
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,970
of course with the solar living center

936
00:37:23,469 --> 00:37:27,219
property that you were referring to in

937
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:29,049
hofland it's an opportunity to have a

938
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:31,119
demonstration garden and to have

939
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:33,320
gardening classes and to allow people to

940
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,329
come up get their hands on the sole

941
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,640
learn about regenerative farming

942
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:39,409
practices take those practices back to

943
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:41,449
where they're from more people are

944
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:43,670
growing food than ever before we're

945
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:46,129
starting to see Victory Gardens pop up

946
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:49,070
people are looking for opportunities to

947
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,720
learn sustainable food production and I

948
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,460
think in the Emerald triangle is one of

949
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,009
the most amazing places to learn about

950
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,960
that oh and it also happens to have some

951
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,760
of the best cannabis in the world so I

952
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,670
think Fluvanna would really like to see

953
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:04,160
the marrying of those two you know

954
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,320
interest groups especially given that

955
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,509
the farmers we work with so many of them

956
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,850
if not most or all of them are growing

957
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:13,040
food in addition to cannabis and are

958
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:14,779
using regenerative methods and so

959
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,610
there's so much that folks can learn

960
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,170
just because of their interest in

961
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,269
cannabis they can come away learning

962
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:23,210
about integrated pest management and

963
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:24,619
good soil health and Water Reclamation

964
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,960
which is something that they may have

965
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:28,339
come up never expecting to learn about

966
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,179
and thinking that they were just gonna

967
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:34,070
go tour a really cool cannabis farm yeah

968
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:36,199
I'm gonna take this opportunity as well

969
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:38,390
to talk about the product makers and the

970
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:40,099
alchemists and it's like the communities

971
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:42,019
that rally around not just the

972
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:45,259
cultivation but all the different kind

973
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:47,480
of disciplines and specific crafts that

974
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:52,030
that has evolved because of that I think

975
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,030
that's also an incredibly unmindful

976
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:59,390
myself that when I go up to Mendocino

977
00:38:56,929 --> 00:39:01,250
and humble I truly have that aesthetic

978
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:03,589
as if I visited a foreign country and

979
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:06,170
that is absolutely a compliment it is a

980
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:08,269
really unique culture with an immense

981
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:11,210
the presence of nature is really intense

982
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:14,090
and the way people think and talk and

983
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:15,949
act and is it really kind of scratches

984
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,920
that it has the international traveler

985
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:20,869
and I think it's amazing that we have

986
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,030
you know this region that offers that

987
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:25,579
that happens to also grow world-class

988
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,500
cannabis and it all goes back to when

989
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:29,179
you start watching the kind of the

990
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,699
movement from the hippie movement to the

991
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:33,679
back to the land and understanding kind

992
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:36,230
of the solar and all those things that

993
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:40,149
tie in to living off the grid I mean

994
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:42,920
it's a really fascinating experience so

995
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:45,559
so we have a tour operator from Brazil

996
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,430
and who would like to know what's the

997
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:51,259
best way

998
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:52,788
to convince regular tourists what's the

999
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,289
best way you think this yeah I'm gonna

1000
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:57,260
translate this a little bit what's the

1001
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:58,640
best to draw forests from because

1002
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,528
obviously this is a great question

1003
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,480
because it speaks to multi markets and

1004
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:05,028
their role in tourism and the question

1005
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,338
essentially is how do we speak to

1006
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:09,949
tourists that arrive in LA or SF and

1007
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:12,650
draw them up to the Emerald triangle and

1008
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:15,679
we're collaboratively with these kind of

1009
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:17,930
gateway cities well I think that you

1010
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,788
know again it's not just the cannabis

1011
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:21,919
right so there's a lot of things that

1012
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:23,150
folks are looking to do nowadays when

1013
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,010
they travel they don't want to

1014
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,539
necessarily go to one location and just

1015
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,700
sit there they're looking to have

1016
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:31,460
different experiences so I think putting

1017
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:33,798
packages together that include Emerald

1018
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,380
triangle related experiences like white

1019
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:40,179
you know river rafting and hiking and

1020
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:44,240
biking and camping and you know

1021
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:47,960
stargazing and foraging and you know

1022
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:49,699
mushroom hunting interesting things that

1023
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,068
are really great in the Emerald triangle

1024
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:55,519
and you pair that with a cannabis

1025
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:57,588
experience then you're kind of a step

1026
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,420
above all the other tour companies that

1027
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,769
aren't doing the cannabis experiences

1028
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,358
and that are just packaging everything

1029
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:05,329
else so one of the things we did last

1030
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:08,420
November pre Kovan which seems like a

1031
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:11,450
million years ago but we had a mushroom

1032
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:14,900
feast at solar Living Center and we did

1033
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:17,449
some CBD and mushroom cocktails not

1034
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,910
psychedelic mushrooms yet cocktails and

1035
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:22,730
imogen infused dinner and emerald farm

1036
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:25,338
tours brought up a group and it made it

1037
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:27,289
part of a Mendocino weekend so you know

1038
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:28,969
there was a craft beer festival going on

1039
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:30,470
that weekend there was the tours of the

1040
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:32,689
redwoods that were available

1041
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:34,838
you know they stayed at a great location

1042
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:37,250
that was in the middle of the forest

1043
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:39,048
they went to the coast which is like a

1044
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,068
whole other world than inland and

1045
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:42,469
Mendocino

1046
00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:44,989
so I think it's about not just focusing

1047
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:48,828
on one particular experience but trying

1048
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:52,338
to create a package that speaks to a

1049
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:53,778
grand experience and the cold of the

1050
00:41:52,338 --> 00:41:56,259
Emerald triangle is that it's just a

1051
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:58,608
very unique place geographically

1052
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,540
visually as you said it feels like

1053
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:01,309
you're in another con

1054
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:03,289
tree you know I'm looking out my window

1055
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:04,940
right now and I kid you not there is a

1056
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:07,519
gigantic rainbow that's stretching

1057
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,320
across the entire valley as I sit here

1058
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,360
and talk to you and that's like a daily

1059
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,420
occurrence so they're interesting really

1060
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,730
special about being up here that will

1061
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:19,880
appeal to folks who want to experience

1062
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:22,490
all sides of California all right Amanda

1063
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,619
one more question we had come in asking

1064
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:27,229
about tour companies specifically and

1065
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:29,449
what can they expect when engaging with

1066
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,250
farms that are also enthusiastic about

1067
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:33,889
tourism what are maybe three to five

1068
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,409
tips you have on how to facilitate those

1069
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:39,259
kind of partnerships for tour companies

1070
00:42:35,409 --> 00:42:41,500
well a couple things for tour companies

1071
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:44,120
that I found that were a little bit

1072
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:46,789
confusing in the last couple of years so

1073
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:50,179
cannabis is a seasonal plant and it's an

1074
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:52,579
annual so it's not like grape vines were

1075
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:54,319
even when the plant is it fruiting it's

1076
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:57,079
still in the ground and looking like

1077
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,760
cool there's nothing in the ground so

1078
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:00,469
you know I would have to or companies

1079
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,740
that would want to go visit farms in

1080
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:05,569
like January or February and they're

1081
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:08,179
just people are gonna be disappointed

1082
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:10,850
because you have so you want to manage

1083
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:12,980
expectations you know and folks who come

1084
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:14,929
up to see farms want to see gigantic

1085
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,420
eight-foot cannabis plants like that's

1086
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:20,059
what they want that's what that's like

1087
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:22,190
the money shot right so thinking about

1088
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:25,039
whether farms that you're working with

1089
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:27,860
have that to offer and what do they have

1090
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,779
to offer from a visual perspective what

1091
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,670
do they have to offer that's unique so

1092
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,430
for example I'll call out Johnny

1093
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:37,130
Casali I saw him I'm here at huckleberry

1094
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:38,809
so they are a fish friendly farm which

1095
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,849
is great it's so cool they have this big

1096
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:43,070
pond it's got a bunch of fish so like

1097
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:45,319
that's a unique aspect to their farm

1098
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:47,120
that is a selling point for for tour

1099
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,280
companies so I say you know be really

1100
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,869
clear with the farmer about what they've

1101
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,480
got going on and what are the

1102
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:56,299
expectations of your group and then you

1103
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:59,059
know be very respectful about what the

1104
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,430
farmers protocols are and you might say

1105
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:03,710
hey they're asking us to do X I know the

1106
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:06,199
law doesn't require that do it anyway

1107
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:09,139
this is their farm they're under huge

1108
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:11,539
huge stress to bring a clean product to

1109
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:13,039
market and that clean product is gonna

1110
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:15,019
be worth way more to them

1111
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,000
you're one to a person who decided that

1112
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:19,730
they wanted to touch all the plants so

1113
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,579
just be very respectful and recognize

1114
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:24,650
that the farmer really needs to lead and

1115
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:29,840
the tour company is there to kind of be

1116
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:31,910
a observer of the process and then

1117
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,250
finally think about what else there is

1118
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:36,649
around the farm and how easy it is to

1119
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:39,860
get to farms so you know some farms are

1120
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:42,769
beautiful but they are a 20-minute drive

1121
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:45,050
on a gravel road up the side of a

1122
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:46,909
mountain and so as a tour company think

1123
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,680
about who's your clientele how

1124
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:50,119
comfortable are they gonna be with

1125
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:51,799
getting out and walking around in the

1126
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:53,960
dirt or would they rather visit a place

1127
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,220
you know that is a little bit you know

1128
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:00,440
less gritty it's really matching who

1129
00:44:58,219 --> 00:45:02,809
your clientele is with what the farm

1130
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,150
experience is but again it really all

1131
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:06,799
starts and ends with the farmer and what

1132
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,300
they feel comfortable with and how they

1133
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,090
would like to showcase their farm to the

1134
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:13,039
public amazing thank you so much Amanda

1135
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,180
for the insight I think the one other

1136
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,519
thing I want to mention while we're on

1137
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:19,759
this topic is I'm very excited for the

1138
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:21,829
curing process to become as compelling

1139
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,690
and people become more aware of all the

1140
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:26,750
really unique you know farmer-to-farmer

1141
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:34,159
craft of how you know how you harvest

1142
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:36,710
and actually cure cannabis folks they

1143
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:40,699
pay to stomp grapes they will absolutely

1144
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:42,710
pay to trim bud and you know that whole

1145
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:46,579
you know pick your own trim your own

1146
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:47,750
model is I see it as being a very very

1147
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:50,539
lucrative future

1148
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,920
all right thanks Amanda we're gonna move

1149
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:54,920
on to the next slide appreciate you

1150
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,200
being here so the next slide is about

1151
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,789
the impact of Cove in nineteen which we

1152
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:00,619
all know has had an absolutely

1153
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:03,019
devastating effect on the tourism and

1154
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:05,210
travel industry for the nation not just

1155
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:06,739
California you'll notice that some of

1156
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,150
these data points are from the national

1157
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:10,849
lens and it's because it is an

1158
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:12,710
all-hands-on-deck situation from hotels

1159
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:17,480
to Airlines to DMOS

1160
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:19,099
the bottom is dropped out and I also

1161
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,490
want to take this opportunity to

1162
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:24,860
acknowledge the amazing work and be and

1163
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:26,348
witnessing the work that US travel

1164
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:30,548
destinations international

1165
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:32,949
Civitas mGy california cal travel visit

1166
00:46:30,548 --> 00:46:35,349
California the California Hotel and

1167
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:36,909
Lodging Association have been relentless

1168
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:39,369
and coming together and providing

1169
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:42,068
amazing information insights that are

1170
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:44,440
really week by week on all this

1171
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:46,329
so this slide though obviously shows

1172
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,958
that it has been devastating for the

1173
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:52,329
travel industry 519 billion decline in

1174
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:56,528
spending in the US this year with a

1175
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:58,089
total economic loss of 1.2 trillion you

1176
00:46:56,528 --> 00:47:01,150
know it shows the gravity of the

1177
00:46:58,088 --> 00:47:02,650
situation at hand and with that I'll

1178
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:04,739
move to the next slide so we could talk

1179
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:07,389
about the next phase we're moving into

1180
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:10,239
so this next slide talks about the most

1181
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:12,788
recent research for the tourism and

1182
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:16,239
travel industry so the data shows that

1183
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:18,160
you know people are looking at road

1184
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:20,650
trips they're looking to travel to

1185
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:22,478
destinations closer to home and will

1186
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:25,930
likely be wanting to drive and that's

1187
00:47:22,478 --> 00:47:28,868
going to be at least q2 3 and most of

1188
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:32,018
for you're looking at the drive market

1189
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:33,579
or drive-in visitation for the tourism

1190
00:47:32,018 --> 00:47:35,258
and travel industry here in California

1191
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:39,459
as well as nationwide and probably

1192
00:47:35,259 --> 00:47:40,989
around the world in recent polls 79

1193
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:42,759
percent of travelers say that they will

1194
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:46,150
change their travel plans over the next

1195
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:47,829
six months probably shifting a lot of

1196
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:51,039
that away from Airlines you know more so

1197
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:52,630
toward toward drive and 55 percent say

1198
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,219
the pandemic will greatly impacted

1199
00:47:52,630 --> 00:48:00,160
travel currently so the good news on the

1200
00:47:57,219 --> 00:48:02,199
last data point is and the week ending

1201
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:03,788
in May second the travel economy

1202
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:07,239
witnessed its first expansion in nine

1203
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:10,539
weeks they still registered pretty low

1204
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:13,028
compared to last year but it shows that

1205
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:13,869
it's hopefully starting to turn in in

1206
00:48:13,028 --> 00:48:17,409
the right direction

1207
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:19,329
and kind of correct course all right so

1208
00:48:17,409 --> 00:48:20,048
now we're at the education color for the

1209
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,239
CCTA

1210
00:48:20,048 --> 00:48:24,518
and really we're going to focus in now

1211
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,528
on traveling in the age of kovin 19

1212
00:48:24,518 --> 00:48:30,488
we're going to do two or three slides

1213
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:32,588
that are dedicated to this so in short

1214
00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:35,920
those who adapt will survive and

1215
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:39,480
eventually thrive health and safety is

1216
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,159
top of mind for everybody and

1217
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,550
the quote necessity is the mother of

1218
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:47,309
invention or innovation and really the

1219
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:49,230
need is to be safe and feel safe and

1220
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:52,469
that's where we all need to be highly

1221
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:56,490
focused and and adapting and right now

1222
00:48:52,469 --> 00:49:00,629
for this next phase you know technology

1223
00:48:56,489 --> 00:49:03,049
is gonna become more of an amenity then

1224
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:06,030
than it was a prior to cope in nineteen

1225
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:07,320
the less human interaction is going to

1226
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:09,330
be perceived as a better guest

1227
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,460
experience in the short term for sure

1228
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:16,940
and I think the long term is to be

1229
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:19,860
determined so travelers are expecting

1230
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:22,769
high-touch hi-tech protocols

1231
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:26,579
health-related products and procedures

1232
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:29,610
hand sanitizers disinfectants face masks

1233
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:31,650
health checks so things need to be

1234
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:34,860
adapted and evolved into something that

1235
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:36,660
is low touch that embraces the social

1236
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:41,190
distancing model and really is a

1237
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:42,839
prevention plan for for kovin 19 nearly

1238
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:45,599
two and three travellers to say that if

1239
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:48,210
the travel economy doesn't take health

1240
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,119
considerations seriously they are likely

1241
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:52,740
to withhold future purpose purchases so

1242
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,230
again that communicates to any business

1243
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:57,119
at the intersection of travel and

1244
00:49:55,230 --> 00:50:00,059
cannabis or the travel industry in

1245
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,549
general that adopting and adapting right

1246
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:04,199
now is incredibly important I want to

1247
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,420
point out to travel in the new normal

1248
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:07,529
this document is one of the I think one

1249
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,050
of the most thorough well put together

1250
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:12,450
publications I've seen come out from

1251
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:14,039
u.s. travel that is also going to be in

1252
00:50:12,449 --> 00:50:16,069
the slack channel that you will all be

1253
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:19,349
invited to join if you if you would like

1254
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:22,710
and that goes into much more detail of

1255
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:26,339
kind of what businesses can do to adapt

1256
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:28,619
to the current landscape okay so health

1257
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:29,309
and safety develop and promote a gold

1258
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:32,940
standard

1259
00:50:29,309 --> 00:50:35,639
Kovan 19 prevention plan number one is

1260
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:37,619
create transmission barriers to adopt

1261
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:40,259
adapt operations modify employee

1262
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:41,839
practices and redesign public spaces to

1263
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,700
help protect employees and customers

1264
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,530
number two is enhance your sanitation

1265
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:48,649
travel business should adopt and

1266
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:50,519
implement enhance sanitation procedures

1267
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,970
specifically designed to combat the

1268
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:55,259
transmission of koban 19

1269
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:58,209
and also promote health screening

1270
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:00,820
measures for employees isolate them if

1271
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:02,800
they feel sick symptoms and be able to

1272
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:05,710
provide health resources to your

1273
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,210
employees a couple of the bullet points

1274
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,309
on the right hand side speak to

1275
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:11,470
screening process for temperature or

1276
00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:14,380
doing an onboarding kind of brief three

1277
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:16,389
question QA how are you feeling have you

1278
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:19,750
been around somebody with Co 219 in the

1279
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:22,059
last 24 hours etc etc I saw an

1280
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:24,219
interesting suggestion of safety as an

1281
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:26,559
amenity we're actually creating an

1282
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:28,809
amenity bag that includes gloves hand

1283
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,759
sanitizer and face masks that let's say

1284
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:33,400
it is a tour company or a hotel guest

1285
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:36,210
that they are provided upon arrival that

1286
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:39,130
is part of the service that they get

1287
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:40,480
engaging with your business and also

1288
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,369
understanding what your third-party

1289
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,130
suppliers are doing and what their

1290
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:46,750
safety measures are currently so you can

1291
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:49,108
really look at your supply chain and

1292
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:52,659
know that it's it's it's a thoughtful

1293
00:51:49,108 --> 00:51:57,460
kind of new model that speaks to the

1294
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:59,679
pandemic that were in the midst of okay

1295
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,990
this is the marketing and communication

1296
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:04,989
front so once you have your SOPs and

1297
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:06,579
your standards recalibrated it's really

1298
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:09,459
being able to communicate that gold

1299
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:11,170
standard for safety communicated to your

1300
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,750
employees communicated to your customers

1301
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:15,130
and let them know that you are taking

1302
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,929
the appropriate measures to make sure

1303
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:18,910
that they are safe and they feel safe

1304
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:20,588
and they are safe you need to be

1305
00:52:18,909 --> 00:52:22,149
sensitive in your communication and be

1306
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:25,659
not sure to overstep you want to build

1307
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:27,579
trust you know data suggests that

1308
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:29,588
travelers are ready to hear about travel

1309
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:31,650
now that we have hopefully bottomed out

1310
00:52:29,588 --> 00:52:34,838
and now they're ready to start slightly

1311
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:36,160
considering what the next trip is so to

1312
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:38,858
approach them in a thoughtful and

1313
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:40,598
empathetic way is it's kind of a good

1314
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:43,179
messaging stretching strategy for now

1315
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:46,750
with a call to action that needs to be

1316
00:52:43,179 --> 00:52:50,409
conveyed very carefully but can't exist

1317
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:52,739
at this point we're past crisis mode as

1318
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:56,019
the data is showing so having a careful

1319
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:58,209
call-to-action built into your messaging

1320
00:52:56,019 --> 00:53:00,219
is now possible but being able to

1321
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,838
communicate your gold standards of what

1322
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:03,889
procedures you've implemented your

1323
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:06,029
amenity bag

1324
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:10,589
use that in your marketing and

1325
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:12,600
communication going forward also you

1326
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:15,090
know the data consistently shows that

1327
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:16,860
drive market visitors are going to be

1328
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:18,030
this phase one which is not shocking

1329
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,769
most people are going to want to stay

1330
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,720
close to home I've seen a few different

1331
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:23,340
kind of mileage recommendations

1332
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:25,730
throughout all the webinars I've been on

1333
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:28,920
in the past eight eight to nine weeks

1334
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:31,440
and they average out to about 125 miles

1335
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,030
from your place of business so as far as

1336
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,650
targeted marketing that would be who you

1337
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:40,650
want to be looking at and trying to

1338
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:43,410
reach so this slide is about b2b talking

1339
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:46,250
points with cannabis hemp and CBD being

1340
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:48,809
as confusing and exciting as it is

1341
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:50,840
there's really four talking points here

1342
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:54,529
that I want to communicate to everybody

1343
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:57,210
about why cannabis is a tourism asset

1344
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:59,340
the first one is cannabis is essential

1345
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:03,030
and this was recently designated here in

1346
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:04,200
California now a lot of the conversation

1347
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:07,470
right now in the travel and tourism

1348
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:09,539
industry is around being open to

1349
00:54:07,469 --> 00:54:11,129
rethinking the framework of the funding

1350
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:13,739
of the destination marketing

1351
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:16,530
organizations and and how the ecosystem

1352
00:54:13,739 --> 00:54:18,539
helps to fund the marketing for any

1353
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:21,750
destination whether it's Mendocino San

1354
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:24,329
Diego or LA and cannabis being an

1355
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:26,219
essential service is an interesting

1356
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:28,019
evolution because that means that as far

1357
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:31,500
as a funding source through an

1358
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:33,780
assessment that cannabis is arguably a

1359
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:36,239
bit more stable than other businesses

1360
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,070
that have not been deemed essential so

1361
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:41,489
the fact that cannabis is essential is a

1362
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:43,950
new is possibly something to consider as

1363
00:54:41,489 --> 00:54:46,589
we develop the new marketing funding

1364
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:48,569
framework and being inclusive of

1365
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:50,280
essential businesses like cannabis to

1366
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:52,800
provide stability so that's the first

1367
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,900
talking point the second talking point

1368
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,930
is travelers are interested from

1369
00:54:54,900 --> 00:55:00,059
cannabis with THC to the CBD infused

1370
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:03,269
topical massage from that's hemp derived

1371
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:05,909
you know it's new and it's exciting and

1372
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:07,469
its growth markets it's continuing to

1373
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:09,449
trend all the data shows that

1374
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:11,699
economically and and with consumer

1375
00:55:09,449 --> 00:55:14,099
interest and it promotes well-being

1376
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:15,569
which was one of kind of the key trends

1377
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:16,690
that was here even prior to coab in

1378
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:18,309
nineteen and the travel and

1379
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:20,920
tourism industry is this sense of

1380
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:23,380
wellness and being a conscious traveler

1381
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,869
and having low impact on when you travel

1382
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:27,519
and cannabis ticks a lot of those boxes

1383
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:30,099
being a medicine and being something

1384
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:32,619
that promotes well-being cannabis can

1385
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:38,019
really kind of find its place in the

1386
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:40,568
California experience so whether it's a

1387
00:55:38,019 --> 00:55:42,250
CBD infused massage for a destination or

1388
00:55:40,568 --> 00:55:43,869
for your business you know you could

1389
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,460
speak to whatever consumer you're trying

1390
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:47,950
to reach the audiences are there

1391
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,789
the third talking point is cannabis is

1392
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:51,368
collaborative

1393
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:54,279
you know cannabis tourism is a tide that

1394
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:56,559
lifts all boats in the tourism ecosystem

1395
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:59,109
of a destination and the reason why is

1396
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:02,139
because cannabis is affects based so

1397
00:55:59,108 --> 00:56:05,318
having cannabis you know at the right

1398
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:08,379
dose 30 minutes or an hour or even 20

1399
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:10,599
minutes if you're inhaling it prior to a

1400
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,818
dining experience is going to amplify

1401
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:15,369
and enhance that experience to make it

1402
00:56:12,818 --> 00:56:18,338
more memorable and the same thing with

1403
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:21,039
creative pursuits museums art exhibits

1404
00:56:18,338 --> 00:56:23,049
so cannabis has this ability to really

1405
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:26,050
have amazing collaborative partners in

1406
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:28,030
their destination and create bundled

1407
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:30,068
packages and ways that are really

1408
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:32,890
supplemental to breathing life and

1409
00:56:30,068 --> 00:56:35,190
increased spending in other businesses

1410
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:38,920
that are part of that tourism ecosystem

1411
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:40,838
or for example on this slide I put you

1412
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,849
know a live music show with cannabis is

1413
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:44,529
different than without and then it comes

1414
00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:46,329
down to dosing and making sure you dose

1415
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:48,130
it correctly just like with alcohol you

1416
00:56:46,329 --> 00:56:50,440
don't have to much we right now the

1417
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:53,380
fourth talking point is cannabis is a

1418
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:56,260
tourism asset it's it's new and exciting

1419
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:58,358
and these cannabis related products

1420
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:00,430
services and experiences are not

1421
00:56:58,358 --> 00:57:03,578
maximized and they're economic drivers

1422
00:57:00,429 --> 00:57:05,710
so between those four talking points I

1423
00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:09,460
urge you to engage with your local

1424
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:12,880
community with your local government and

1425
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:15,550
to start communicating the value of CBD

1426
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,890
hemp and cannabis tourism and start

1427
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:20,050
identifying assets or develop an asset

1428
00:57:17,889 --> 00:57:22,838
yourself or continue to polish your

1429
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:24,940
cannabis business to be a valued asset

1430
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:27,789
as part of the tourism ecosystem of your

1431
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:29,539
destination all right so three key

1432
00:57:27,789 --> 00:57:31,518
takeaways

1433
00:57:29,539 --> 00:57:33,829
if we were to have to distill this down

1434
00:57:31,518 --> 00:57:36,918
into three key takeaways number one is

1435
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:38,859
drive market visitation so a dr. model

1436
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:42,138
to really target the drive and visitor

1437
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:43,759
number two is health and safety you need

1438
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:46,009
to recalibrate from employees to

1439
00:57:43,759 --> 00:57:48,349
customers and communicate that extremely

1440
00:57:46,009 --> 00:57:49,969
effectively in your marketing

1441
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:53,269
communications which leads to number

1442
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:55,338
three to engage and educate so once you

1443
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:58,578
have your new health and safety kind of

1444
00:57:55,338 --> 00:58:01,728
code in nineteen landscape operations

1445
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:03,349
implemented to be able to educate and

1446
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:05,358
engage through marketing or through

1447
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:07,969
advocacy to your local government or to

1448
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:10,278
your potential customers what you have

1449
00:58:07,969 --> 00:58:14,269
done to respond as a business to be able

1450
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:18,018
to continue to function in a safe way in

1451
00:58:14,268 --> 00:58:19,968
today's today's today's landscape all

1452
00:58:18,018 --> 00:58:22,398
right so this touches a bit back on

1453
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:24,588
resources that I've mentioned in the

1454
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:26,708
slack channel that we've created that

1455
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:28,728
everybody is going to be able to access

1456
00:58:26,708 --> 00:58:31,458
this is the CCTA

1457
00:58:28,728 --> 00:58:32,989
open resource slack channel we're

1458
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:35,208
starting to kind of file things under

1459
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:37,849
hash tags financial research marketing

1460
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:39,798
and advocacy yet again I want to thank

1461
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:42,499
all the logos that are on this slide and

1462
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:44,208
beyond I mean it's been such an amazing

1463
00:58:42,498 --> 00:58:46,938
thing to witness the travel industry

1464
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:49,248
come together from the national level to

1465
00:58:46,938 --> 00:58:52,398
the state level to provide quality

1466
00:58:49,248 --> 00:58:55,428
information in real time data as we

1467
00:58:52,398 --> 00:58:57,528
navigate this very strange time there's

1468
00:58:55,429 --> 00:58:59,749
publications that have been selected and

1469
00:58:57,528 --> 00:59:01,909
uploaded to that slack channel from

1470
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:05,238
different organizations that we felt

1471
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:06,919
really spoke to our membership base so

1472
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:08,630
you can find that on the slack Channel

1473
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,969
if you decide to join and we will

1474
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:12,829
continue adding to that as we as we

1475
00:59:10,969 --> 00:59:15,309
further go into this rebound and

1476
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:17,929
recovery phase of the travel industry

1477
00:59:15,309 --> 00:59:19,909
the CCTA does have a bi-monthly

1478
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:22,159
newsletter which you will all be getting

1479
00:59:19,909 --> 00:59:23,479
you could easily opt out of it if you

1480
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:27,499
would not like to receive it

1481
00:59:23,478 --> 00:59:32,328
the newsletter will be going out in June

1482
00:59:27,498 --> 00:59:34,308
August October and December so basically

1483
00:59:32,329 --> 00:59:37,519
the off months from the virtual event

1484
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:39,859
you'll be getting a CCTA newsletter in

1485
00:59:37,518 --> 00:59:43,559
that newsletter you will see what the

1486
00:59:39,858 --> 00:59:45,989
July date is for the next virtual event

1487
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:47,909
also I want to take this opportunity to

1488
00:59:45,989 --> 00:59:49,769
talk about a new initiative that's

1489
00:59:47,909 --> 00:59:53,129
coming together this year for the CCTA

1490
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:55,829
which is the first annual California

1491
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:58,230
cannabis tourism report published by the

1492
00:59:55,829 --> 01:00:00,329
CCTA and we have a couple contributing

1493
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:01,530
different contributing organizations and

1494
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:03,780
companies that are going to be part of

1495
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:06,060
that we also are conducting our own

1496
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:09,180
research which Amanda alluded to earlier

1497
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:11,369
on we do plan on publishing this in

1498
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:13,828
August and it's going to be a

1499
01:00:11,369 --> 01:00:15,599
comprehensive overview of the state of

1500
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:18,000
cannabis tourism in California so we

1501
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,010
look forward to that we're gonna cross

1502
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,838
our fingers and shoot for July so we can

1503
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:24,750
include those insights and that could be

1504
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:26,369
a big part of our next virtual event but

1505
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:28,710
we've set it for no later than August

1506
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:32,970
and you'll get updates in the newsletter

1507
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:36,088
and on the slack Channel about that all

1508
01:00:32,969 --> 01:00:39,269
right so this is the second to last

1509
01:00:36,088 --> 01:00:41,818
slide and really it's just a recap of

1510
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:44,940
five kind of key points that we covered

1511
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:47,519
through this presentation one is through

1512
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:49,230
the end of 2020 most of our services and

1513
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,969
virtual events are available to anybody

1514
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:51,630

1515
01:00:50,969 --> 01:00:53,549
CCTA

1516

network and invite anybody that you

1518
01:00:55,139 --> 01:00:59,400
think would find this interesting or

1519
01:00:56,338 --> 01:01:01,440
valuable I mentioned that it's in

1520
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,630

event space and with that we can move on

1540

Brian a cannabis tourism CA org or hit

1560
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:34,690
me up in the slack channel and also one

1561
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:37,179
final thank you to all the different

1562
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:39,309
travel organizations that have been

1563
01:02:37,179 --> 01:02:41,859
providing these webinars and these white

1564
01:02:39,309 --> 01:02:45,840
papers and this research over the last

1565
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:48,610
nine weeks it's been really eye-opening

1566
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,960
really understanding how seeing the

1567
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:52,180
community come together the travel

1568
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:55,389
industry come together and support each

1569
01:02:52,179 --> 01:02:56,500
other through this so on that note I'm

1570
01:02:55,389 --> 01:03:01,989
going to take a look and see if we have

1571
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:03,460
any questions all right one question is

1572
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:05,679
does anyone have any idea on how to

1573
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:07,150
monetize virtual cannabis travel this is

1574
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:10,239
a great question especially right now

1575
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:11,740
you know if there's anybody any brands

1576
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:13,329
any companies that are sitting on

1577
01:03:11,739 --> 01:03:15,909
digital content that hasn't been

1578
01:03:13,329 --> 01:03:17,679
maximized I think that's part of

1579
01:03:15,909 --> 01:03:21,129
reaching your customer and folding in

1580
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:24,819
your Kovan 19 messaging strategy in

1581
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:27,250
tandem with this content one of the

1582
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:31,090
recent kind of audiences that I spoke to

1583
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:32,739
the enthusiasm of seeing a cannabis grow

1584
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:35,559
and experiencing what a tour would be

1585
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:37,149
like was a very high interest and

1586
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:39,369
brought a lot of smiles to people's

1587
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:42,039
faces in the room so I think having

1588
01:03:39,369 --> 01:03:45,099
bite-sized video or photographs with

1589
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:46,989
storytelling perhaps you know getting on

1590
01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:49,239
an interview maybe you interview one of

1591
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:51,069
your past passengers so they could story

1592
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:54,129
tell about the experience as you show

1593
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:56,289
photographs you know and can you

1594
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:58,059
monetize it I think I mean I again

1595
01:03:56,289 --> 01:04:00,190
technologically challenged I don't

1596
01:03:58,059 --> 01:04:02,139
understand fully the ad space and things

1597
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:03,550
like that but I know that there's if you

1598
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:05,019
get the right amount of traffic you can

1599
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:08,350
through through advertising and

1600
01:04:05,019 --> 01:04:09,429
marketing also just straight entry fee

1601
01:04:08,349 --> 01:04:11,889
if you have a 30

1602
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:14,049
inexperience with a QA with a cultivator

1603
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:15,730
perhaps people are willing to pitch up

1604
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:18,068
five bucks to be able to access that

1605
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:19,960
especially if it's somebody who is well

1606
01:04:18,068 --> 01:04:21,608
recognized or an influencer in the

1607
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:24,490
cannabis face or is doing something very

1608
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:25,630
unique when I was speaking over in

1609
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:27,608
Europe last year

1610
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:29,200
there's definitely California

1611
01:04:27,608 --> 01:04:31,779
cultivators and breeders that are

1612
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,828
well-known internationally a lot of them

1613
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,490
are right up here from Northern

1614
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:37,680
California

1615
01:04:33,489 --> 01:04:41,949
Swami select Frenchie cannoli you know

1616
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:43,088
there's Kevin Joe dree I mean there was

1617
01:04:41,949 --> 01:04:45,279
a handful of people that kept getting

1618
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:47,259
asked about when I was over there so I

1619
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,849
would look at people in cannabis you are

1620
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:50,260
the thought leaders of their respective

1621
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:57,369
craft and potentially there's a

1622
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:58,569
collaboration there this next question

1623
01:04:57,369 --> 01:04:59,980
is can you share your thoughts about

1624
01:04:58,568 --> 01:05:02,440
cannabis appellations and cannabis

1625
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:03,880
tourism I look at cannabis appellations

1626
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,230
as one of the key pieces of

1627
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,940
infrastructure for the state of

1628
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:08,500
California for California cannabis

1629
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:10,210
tourism

1630
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,159
I think the Appalachians are gonna give

1631
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:14,559
us that foundation to be able to market

1632
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:17,170
from and be able to give these small

1633
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,670
legacy farmers a platform to speak to

1634
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:21,039
their craft and theirs and their

1635
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:23,769
small-batch kind of Northern California

1636
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:26,349
grown cannabis so the Appalachians is

1637
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:29,259
going to be an all tides rise kind of

1638
01:05:26,349 --> 01:05:31,420
play as that comes in and that's going

1639
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:33,390
to become a key tourism asset for the

1640
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:36,490
state of California to draw visitation

1641
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:39,098
Humboldt and Mendocino both already have

1642
01:05:36,489 --> 01:05:42,848
brand equity internationally as the best

1643
01:05:39,099 --> 01:05:45,190
cultivation spots or core growers in the

1644
01:05:42,849 --> 01:05:47,440
world so it's how do we build off of

1645
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:49,450
that how do we take the brand equity of

1646
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,088
the Emerald triangle of humble of

1647
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:53,858
Mendocino how do we fold it into a way

1648
01:05:52,088 --> 01:05:56,199
where it really fits into the California

1649
01:05:53,858 --> 01:05:58,989
brand and we do it in a way that's based

1650
01:05:56,199 --> 01:06:00,578
in wellness in nature that's that allows

1651
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:03,009
for storage storytelling about

1652
01:06:00,579 --> 01:06:05,230
Californians and and how we did it and

1653
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:08,349
why we did it and all the values that

1654
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:10,119
kind of go along with that story so I

1655
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:12,579
think the Appalachians is an incredible

1656
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:15,309
platform for obviously place of origin

1657
01:06:12,579 --> 01:06:17,349
but also a platform to tell about life

1658
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:19,269
under Prohibition just like the tunnels

1659
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:21,580
in Chicago or a New Braunfels Texas

1660
01:06:19,269 --> 01:06:23,469
where they used to smuggle alcohol

1661
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:25,480
you know bar to bar restaurant to

1662
01:06:23,469 --> 01:06:28,059
restaurant when when alcohol was illegal

1663
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:30,030
so we've got a lot of interesting

1664
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:32,259
storytelling to mine and I think the

1665
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:34,600
Appalachians first and foremost will be

1666
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:36,970
about terroir and quality but when you

1667
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:38,769
start listening to the stories of the

1668
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:42,489
people that are the fabric of the

1669
01:06:38,769 --> 01:06:45,820
culture up there it's just a well of

1670
01:06:42,489 --> 01:06:50,019
incredible story telling you one more

1671
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:52,809
question so this one is how can I become

1672
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:54,639
involved as a volunteer support CCTA as

1673
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:55,509
an individual not a business that's a

1674
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,239
great question

1675
01:06:55,510 --> 01:07:00,700
I please email me we are forming

1676
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,409
committees we are constantly growing

1677
01:07:00,699 --> 01:07:04,899
this model and looking for people who

1678
01:07:02,409 --> 01:07:06,819
are enthusiastic about the cannabis

1679
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:09,940
tourism opportunity for our state and

1680
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:13,120
for your local market we have discussed

1681
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:16,960

1682
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:18,670

1683
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,519

from content to support we are a 501 C 6

1689

non-profit and we work hard as an

1690
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:37,000
organization to really help steward this

1691
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:39,190
evolution of cannabis tourism in

1692
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,590
California the more hands on deck the

1693
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:44,470
better so come in come with passion

1694
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:46,870
we'll find a spot and and if you are a

1695
01:07:44,469 --> 01:07:48,339
business our membership typically of

1696
01:07:46,869 --> 01:07:50,319
course it's open to everybody through

1697
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:53,380
year end most of our most of our

1698
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:54,970
membership services are open to anyone

1699
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:58,630
through year end we have a couple that

1700
01:07:54,969 --> 01:08:01,359
will not be but in a typical year the

1701
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:04,660
memberships start at 250 dollars for a

1702
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:07,420
year membership first businesses with 25

1703
01:08:04,659 --> 01:08:10,089
employees or less for those with 25

1704
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:12,909
employees or more it goes up obviously

1705
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:15,190
it's $5,000 a year we want brands that

1706
01:08:12,909 --> 01:08:17,710
really value the tourism opportunity

1707
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:19,659
here and then are going to engage with

1708
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:23,350
the travel industry of the state and

1709
01:08:19,659 --> 01:08:25,809
become models and examples of of how

1710
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:29,320
cannabis tourism will evolve and is

1711
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:31,510
evolving and we're really excited to get

1712
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:33,309
as many people involved as are willing

1713
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:34,210
and doing this together

1714
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,339
can all have really healthy

1715
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:38,560
communication so we can make this

1716
01:08:36,338 --> 01:08:44,710
everything that it should be for

1717
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:49,630
California as a poor ISM asset let's see

1718
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:51,489
I think we have time for one more so

1719
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:54,069
this one was do you provide education on

1720
01:08:51,489 --> 01:08:55,989
how to start a tourism association to

1721
01:08:54,069 --> 01:08:59,859
other states the answer is currently no

1722
01:08:55,989 --> 01:09:01,329
but we have been contacted by kind of

1723
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:03,370
tourism cannabis tours and thought

1724
01:09:01,329 --> 01:09:06,100
leaders in other countries as well as

1725
01:09:03,369 --> 01:09:09,149
other states that are very interested in

1726
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:12,250
what we're doing and wanting to expand

1727
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:15,189
so if you're interested in discussing

1728
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:16,569
that and perhaps helping steward that we

1729
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:19,210
do have a model that we've been working

1730
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:21,310
on since November 2017 when we started

1731
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:22,630
and we had a lot of learnings in that

1732
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:26,260
time we have a lot of great information

1733
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:28,060
in that time that we've banked and it

1734
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:30,579
would be a great initiative to start

1735
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:32,620
thinking about how do we expand how do

1736
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:34,329
we get this into other states and how do

1737
01:09:32,619 --> 01:09:37,239
we support each other and trade

1738
01:09:34,329 --> 01:09:39,010
information and the last question I'm

1739
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:40,989
going to answer is if the social

1740
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:43,239
distancing goes on for a year how can we

1741
01:09:40,989 --> 01:09:45,338
bring people into our venues that's a

1742
01:09:43,239 --> 01:09:47,529
great question I think it is the social

1743
01:09:45,338 --> 01:09:50,159
distancing model I think that there's a

1744
01:09:47,529 --> 01:09:52,300
place for it to be honest I believe that

1745
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:54,880
there are certain travelers that are

1746
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:59,020
ready to have a bit more space and and

1747
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,970
have it be in less crowded areas and to

1748
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:03,700
have these exclusive experiences whether

1749
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:06,280
it's in a retail shop or whether you

1750
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:08,979
know it's having tables space six to

1751
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:10,630
eight feet apart or whether it's you

1752
01:10:08,979 --> 01:10:12,729
know in nature experience like Amanda

1753
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:15,489
spoke about where there's plenty of

1754
01:10:12,729 --> 01:10:17,409
wide-open spaces in nature so I think

1755
01:10:15,489 --> 01:10:19,899
it's really getting creative and

1756
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:21,909
understanding that social distancing

1757
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:24,489
model and and traveling in the age of

1758
01:10:21,909 --> 01:10:26,889
Koba 19 is a very unique landscape but

1759
01:10:24,489 --> 01:10:29,019
it's it also opens off opportunities to

1760
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:30,940
innovate and differentiate and as long

1761
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,680
as you're willing to adapt then really

1762
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:35,649
dream about your model and a different

1763
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:37,720
version of it I think it's all about

1764
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:41,049
that kind of ingenuity and creativity

1765
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:44,079
and then being able to adequately mark

1766
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:46,449
and message about that to your customers

1767
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:48,970
and lastly I'll say you know cannabis

1768
01:10:46,449 --> 01:10:51,729
tourism is very new you know it includes

1769
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:53,500
CBD it includes hemp you know hemp can

1770
01:10:51,729 --> 01:10:56,559
replace plastics and paper

1771
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:59,020
CBD is not psychoactive and it's pretty

1772
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,880
much every spa now has a CBD infused

1773
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:02,710
massage and then of course you have the

1774
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,770
cannabis the licensed regulated cannabis

1775
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:08,529
industry with THC consumption so this is

1776
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:10,600
a very new space and we all have the

1777
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:12,670
responsibility to educate each other on

1778
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,560
the travel industry side as well as the

1779
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:17,170
cannabis side because it's through

1780
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,380
healthy conversation and discussion that

1781
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:21,670
we can really steward this forward and

1782
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:23,680
there's models where you don't have to

1783
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:26,590
have inhalation you don't have to have

1784
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:29,230
high THC products maybe you're a hotel

1785
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:31,630
right a hotel in Sacramento contact me

1786
01:11:29,229 --> 01:11:33,009
about eight months ago that simply

1787
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:36,789
wanted to understand how they could

1788
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:38,619
implement hemp into their hotel to raise

1789
01:11:36,789 --> 01:11:41,710
the level of sustainability that they're

1790
01:11:38,619 --> 01:11:43,359
currently operating at so it's a very

1791
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:45,579
exciting space with a lot of different

1792
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:48,579
conversations to be had I just encourage

1793
01:11:45,579 --> 01:11:50,140
all of you to engage and finally just

1794
01:11:48,579 --> 01:11:52,119
thanks again for being here what a great

1795
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:54,910
turnout we look forward to hopefully

1796
01:11:52,119 --> 01:11:56,590
seeing all of you in July you'll be

1797
01:11:54,909 --> 01:11:59,199

1798
01:11:56,590 --> 01:12:00,760
invites the slack channel and thank you

1799

1800
