1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:17,070
she says tell me a little bit about what

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:27,990
you do so ok who are you what do you do

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:37,189
hi my name is Steven Rae's 'nor are a is

4
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:45,119
n er and my company name is potent P ot

5
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:52,979
ent ponics P o n is and I work with

6
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:57,890
aquaponics aquaponics is using fish and

7
00:00:52,979 --> 00:01:03,238
fish waste to provide nutrients for

8
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:08,629
plants to grow this allows us to use a

9
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:14,969
lot less water and a lot less nutrients

10
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:21,289
than traditional farming methods how

11
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:24,959
does it work with low water how you use

12
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:28,680
the fish farm so we use significantly

13
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:32,819
less water by recirculating all of the

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:36,960
water from the fish tanks so none of the

15
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:38,938
water goes into the soil and into the

16
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,969
ground where it's not available again

17
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:45,658
for the plants this also helps in

18
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:49,099
extremely hot environments because the

19
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:53,368
plants have a lot more water available

20
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:56,069
so for places like deserts or island

21
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:58,799
nations where they have a lot of heat

22
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:01,218
with not a lot of water it can be a

23
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,420
great way to grow up both vegetables and

24
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:05,419
medicine plant medicinal plants

25
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:18,500
what filter do you use we use a separate

26
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:24,480
called a radial flow separator or a slow

27
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:26,580
pass-through filter that allows the

28
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,340
weight the fish waste to the heavy fish

29
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,130
waste to settle to the bottom as the

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,080
water flows through the chamber where it

31
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,348
can be then separated and vacuumed off

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:42,239
the bottom put into a separate tank and

33
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:44,310
turned into a compost tea of sorts to

34
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,789
unlock the nutrients from that fish

35
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:52,759
waste in a similar manner to what

36
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:52,759
happens in soil with animal compost

37
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:17,819
hydrogen and the fish waste oso4 pH and

38
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:21,530
the fish waste fish castings using worm

39
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:25,109
castings she says in there or is it just

40
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:30,439
fish waste fish water or other elements

41
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:34,140
to it or yeah how they're similar yes

42
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:36,990
okay so so she was asking how fish waste

43
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:42,179
is similar to terrestrial creature waste

44
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:47,490
so in the soil you have the terrestrial

45
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:56,610
or soil food web in aquaponics we use

46
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:58,890
the aquatic or water food web and this

47
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,690
allows us to unlock those nutrients the

48
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:05,809
same way that they would happen in soil

49
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:05,810
just using different species of microbes

50
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,689
do you have to add anything to it to the

51
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:28,579
the water for the fish or for the plants

52
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:32,300
or is it a a good standalone media so so

53
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:34,519
you do have to add iron and adjust the

54
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,660
pH with things like calcium or potassium

55
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:41,829
just to maintain stability but you you

56
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,830
don't have to add very much

57
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:56,130
she says something I would love to try

58
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:58,680
that methodology one day mmm yeah it's a

59
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:01,110
great it's a great gardening method and

60
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,030
provides a lot of different options and

61
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,460
much faster plant growth plants can grow

62
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:07,459
almost twice as fast in using aquaponics

63
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:19,680
she says saves a lot saving water is a

64
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:25,409
big thing yep very important a lot of

65
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:29,790
water to feed plants and she says it can

66
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:31,410
be exhausting did you imagine everybody

67
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:36,450
just using up all the natural resources

68
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:39,290
of water she says I mean that's the way

69
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:40,949
a future if it stands the way it is

70
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,800
absolutely that's why we need to work

71
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:45,990
together of soil organic growers and us

72
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,329
aquaponic growers and you know we're all

73
00:05:45,990 --> 00:06:00,168
on the same team of less water and more

74
00:05:48,329 --> 00:06:07,259
sustainability keep it simple absolutely

75
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:11,819
look to nature look to nature well thank

76
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,899
you so much thank you very much for your

77
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,629
time we appreciate it

78
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:22,500
I appreciate it if you had to come up

79
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:25,110
with a a body language for hydroponics

80
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,519
what would you imagine in your head

81
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,520
well you paint that picture like

82
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:48,600
like water plants maybe a fish swimming

83
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:48,599
into can you do can you do like his

84
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,670
because you have it's a water solution

85
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:05,439
with the nutrients so you have the or

86
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:09,210
maybe nutrient water plant or is that

87
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,209
too much like to watering the

88
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,079
yeah

89
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:35,789
like exploding fish

90
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:53,149
