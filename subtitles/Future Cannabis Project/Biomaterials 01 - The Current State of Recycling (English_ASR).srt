[Music]

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,719
I'm really glad that everyone's here to

3
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:17,759
have this discussion on materials

4
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,698
specifically biomaterials but like

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,779
materials affect everyone's life it's

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,260
such a degree that I think sometimes

7
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:29,368
people forget about it like parents

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,429
buying a new couch or office managers

9
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:34,920
buying holiday gifts or even the Olympic

10
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:37,979
Committee who is playing like the LA

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,870
Olympics are going to be the first zero

12
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,359
waste and energy positive Olympics in

13
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,339
2024 and so like everybody is really

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,839
affected by these materials and like

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,579
what happens to these materials when

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,020
we're done with all of these products so

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,289
I'm glad that we can have this

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,199
discussion tonight first off we're gonna

19
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,359
introduce Jessica Aldridge who has had a

20
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,608
lot of experience in sustainability and

21
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,679
waste so Jessica you want to tell us a

22
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:06,599
little bit about your journey yeah I I

23
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,760
have worked in zero waste and resource

24
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,469
management and recycling world for 15

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,469
years almost

26
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:15,030
I am a sustainability and zero waste

27
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,890
programs manager from one of the largest

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,099
recycling companies in Los Angeles

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,650
County I have my own nonprofit which is

30
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:25,019
called adventurism waste and it's just

31
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,868
going through its its rebranding because

32
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,789
it used to be Burbank and Alliance and

33
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:32,280
instead of focusing on sustainability as

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,829
a whole we also helped start the local

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,560
350.org chapter which is SoCal 350 and

36
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:40,199
now I'm just focusing directly on waste

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,950
and trying to the concept is to bridge

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,750
the information gap and experience and

39
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,340
knowledge between those in the waste

40
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,259
industry and the experience knowledge of

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,280
those who are just everyday people and

42
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,989
so that we can come to solutions and and

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,250
building a site that's a go-to resource

44
00:01:54,989 --> 00:02:00,780
hub so it you know this concept of oh if

45
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,709
someone asks you a question someone ask

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,420
you a question you're just writing

47
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:05,759
everything down on a cocktail napkin and

48
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,350
you hand it to them but in the waste

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,538
world a lot of us have that same

50
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,219
experience of the concept is to take

51
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,919
that napkin and put it into an actual

52
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:16,580
hub of information

53
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,899
that would be very helpful I I forgot to

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,540
introduce myself to you my name is are

55
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,640
dia denies and I am the founder of pole

56
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:25,759
EEMA and I'm helping companies find

57
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:28,789
materials made from waste and biology so

58
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,919
having that kind of resource to to send

59
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:32,269
people to or we can actually understand

60
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:34,899
everything that's going on with

61
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:39,110
materials would be super super helpful

62
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,450
yeah definitely so what I would like you

63
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:45,350
to kind of tell us just so everyone has

64
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:46,819
like a base knowledge what is how is how

65
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,099
are we doing with recycling right now

66
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,939
like globally what's what's going on are

67
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:53,659
we doing a good job

68
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:57,620
well we're hurting a little bit right

69
00:02:53,659 --> 00:03:00,819
now for sure there's an extreme global

70
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,289
shift that we've never seen before and

71
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:05,750
where we used to take our materials to

72
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:09,289
be recycled the majority of 60% or more

73
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:12,379
going to China 60 more than 60% of our

74
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:14,030
exports of of waste going to China from

75
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:15,769
the United States to be processed in

76
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,629
some manner is not happening anymore

77
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:20,150
because that door is closed and that

78
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:22,400
door is not closed because there's a

79
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,250
trade war there's sanctions in all this

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,039
it's it's closed because China has been

81
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,650
on this path for the past seven or so

82
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:33,109
years to say we want less and less of

83
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,459
your contamination and your waste and

84
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,140
when I say contamination I'm not just

85
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,969
talking about food being on a recyclable

86
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:40,238
I'm talking about metals mixed with

87
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:43,579
paper and paper mixed with glass and

88
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,340
stuff that we just can't really recycle

89
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,959
but we've been told by our cities and

90
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,420
we've been told by everyone don't worry

91
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,860
it's recyclable in some place in the

92
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:53,208
middle of North Dakota where there's

93
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,500
some guy who can actually break it down

94
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,700
in his garage but that doesn't really

95
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,530
actually mean that it's really

96
00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:00,949
recyclable and that there's a global

97
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:04,400
market for it and China also they want

98
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:06,379
20s got 20s guys a blue skies by 2050

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,360
that's their goal so they have this

100
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:12,079
green sword that says if your

101
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,790
contamination rate is over 0.5% for most

102
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,379
of the product we're not going to take

103
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:17,329
it and if it's metals its 1%

104
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:20,810
contamination we're not going to take

105
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:23,900
this stuff and so the whole globe is

106
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,848
trying to find new places to take this

107
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,120
material and have it be processed and

108
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,000
the

109
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,709
a lot of the recycling companies he's

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,459
small some very large recycling

111
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:36,079
infrastructure but then China have

112
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:37,849
picked up moved and gone to other

113
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,168
countries as well but these countries

114
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,639
are now getting this material and

115
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:41,810
they're like hey wait a minute we can't

116
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,189
process this we don't have the

117
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,540
infrastructure here or what

118
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:47,209
infrastructure we have doesn't take that

119
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,300
stuff and you see in places like the

120
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:53,649
Philippines where countries like Korea

121
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:57,168
and Canada have gone and docked their

122
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:59,209
BART barges of waste and said oh yeah

123
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:00,469
it's diverted we diverted it we took it

124
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:02,870
out of our country and we stuck it

125
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,310
somewhere else and then the Philippines

126
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,939
are like no no you're gonna take this

127
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:10,339
back so they just one of activists there

128
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:11,990
just want a great campaign to get Korea

129
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:14,750
to start taking this stuff back and I'm

130
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,699
gonna be targeting Canada soon so we are

131
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:24,310
recycling rate here in the United States

132
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:27,620
is about 26% and I in California it is a

133
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:31,430
little over 40% where it used to be 50%

134
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,759
back in 2014 which is what it regulatory

135
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,819
wise is it supposed to be 50% or more so

136
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:41,360
we're going down and down because we can

137
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:43,870
no longer say that a product is divert a

138
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,360
ball and just go stick it somewhere and

139
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:50,000
outsource our problem on to someone else

140
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,848
is suffering which is known as a form of

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,370
waste colonization we can no longer you

142
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:57,379
know do this and be honest about this

143
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,209
thing we need to take this material back

144
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:00,769
we need to process it in our own country

145
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:02,810
if we're going to become if we're going

146
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:04,639
to be creating this material and saying

147
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,848
that's recyclable and we need to build

148
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,439
infrastructure here we need do a lot

149
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,759
more than that you need to stop we don't

150
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,848
need to be creating this stuff in the

151
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,860
first place but and that's the thing is

152
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:18,079
now people are saying oh gosh plastic is

153
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,330
so bad since we're doing such a bad job

154
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,609
at recycling it let's stop producing so

155
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:24,500
much and let's produce some new products

156
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,860
but what are the what are the issues

157
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,598
with bringing in these completely new

158
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,979
products into the waste stream like what

159
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,750
does that look like when they're at the

160
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:34,788
end of their life and what problems is

161
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,649
that causing yeah and just to say about

162
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:37,908
the plastics we've only since the time

163
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,739
that they have been created since the

164
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:41,569
1950s have ever

165
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,460
recycled maybe nine percent of all the

166
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,560
plastics they've ever been created yeah

167
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:47,269
and the rest are in landfills or in

168
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,360
those who made eight point three billion

169
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:51,829
metric tons of this material and have

170
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,759
wasted six point three billion metric

171
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:57,199
tons of it

172
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,519
it's it's it's crazy and and just

173
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,819
another fact the Ellen MacArthur

174
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:04,729
Foundation through the the new plastics

175
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,860
economy are the thing I got that right

176
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:10,360
um I am like rattling off things in my

177
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,699
head and like wait a minute said that

178
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,400
the amount of waste that we're looking

179
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,709
at creating in the near future by 2050

180
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,060
we're going to have more plastic in the

181
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:23,079
ocean by weight than we are going to

182
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,910
have fish and currently right now the

183
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:28,310
way that we create plastic is through

184
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,430
oil production and 6% of our oil

185
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:35,480
production goes towards creating plastic

186
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:37,699
by 2030 it's going to go up to you know

187
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,400
20% of our oil production is going to go

188
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:43,099
towards plastic so we need to stop the

189
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:45,620
source where it's starting and then we

190
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,810
need to also move into other options and

191
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,340
opportunities and first and foremost is

192
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,470
not making this stuff in the first place

193
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:54,109
because we can't just trade one

194
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,180
single-use disposable item for another

195
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,100
single-use disposable item no matter

196
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,959
what it's made out of we need to look at

197
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,540
solutions that say no waste in the first

198
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,459
place but then when we go into this

199
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,319
trade-off of single-use disposable items

200
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:08,569
and or maybe not even single-use

201
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,430
disposable use maybe it's you know it's

202
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:14,478
couches and it's you know it's chairs

203
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:16,490
durable chairs and couches go figure we

204
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,079
we have to understand how that material

205
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,329
is going to work within the system as

206
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,978
well so the people who are creating

207
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:24,560
these materials need to be talking

208
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:26,750
downstream to where that stuff is going

209
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,209
to be processed in the end and if it can

210
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:32,509
even be processed so when we look at

211
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:36,079
stuff like bio plastics material that's

212
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:39,229
not plastic but it's made out of you

213
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,538
know corn or potato starch or whatever

214
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:43,370
it might be and they they create a

215
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:46,370
product that looks like plastic but it's

216
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,679
actually made out of plants can that

217
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,090
material then be processed can it be

218
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:52,799
recycled or can it be composted

219
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:56,070
as we said everything could be recycled

220
00:08:52,799 --> 00:09:02,429
in some place somewhere in the middle of

221
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:05,070
the country or yes but everything can

222
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:06,449
potentially be recycled but is it going

223
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,390
to actually be recycled is there a

224
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,860
market for it and with composting this

225
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,059
material because it is a plant-based

226
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,149
material so people think oh it's

227
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:16,859
compostable and if it's certified BPI

228
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:19,259
certified biodegradable products

229
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,169
institute certified says this material

230
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:24,960
can be composted in a high-heat compost

231
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:27,539
facility or in some of them like paper

232
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,250
products in a backyard backyard system

233
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,349
but do we have those facilities in Los

234
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,940
Angeles yes well we have them outside of

235
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,040
Los Angeles we have facilities at

236
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,670
service Los Angeles but the problem is

237
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:42,059
the BPI certification certifies for a

238
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:44,909
degradation of six months so they this

239
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,259
product needs to sit on average the

240
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:49,049
product needs to sit in the high heat

241
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:52,110
compost facility for six months if it's

242
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:54,149
an aerobic compost facility with is

243
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,190
which is with air could be wind road

244
00:09:54,149 --> 00:10:00,209
technology big rows of what is

245
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:04,310
eventually compost it's it's a three

246
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:06,930
month degradation process and because

247
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:09,299
that's the process they can get they can

248
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:10,679
get the materials in and out there's a

249
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:12,990
lot of materials that are coming in with

250
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,000
new legislation that's passed we need to

251
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,149
get 50% of the organics out of our

252
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,710
landfills and into these composting

253
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,079
infrastructure or whatever it may be and

254
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,730
so they need to process this as quick as

255
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,400
possible so it's a three month

256
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:29,009
degradation so if a compostable

257
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:31,500
bioplastic item goes into an aerobic

258
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:32,939
compost facility it's probably in the

259
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,649
current situation it's probably not

260
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,150
going to break down and a lot of these

261
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:39,120
compost facilities are going to see that

262
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:40,769
either as a contaminant they're gonna

263
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,179
see it as a contaminant period it's a

264
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:43,500
it's a contaminant that they accept and

265
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:44,909
then they'll pull out but everything

266
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,769
that goes over the line at a compost

267
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:48,659
facility needs to leave as diversion and

268
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:52,939
if it's trash it's not leaving as

269
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:55,980
diversion the other issue is given

270
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,440
regulation if the come if they want to

271
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,200
sell this compost to an organic farm or

272
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,100
farm that that you know grows organic

273
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,430
food they

274
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,680
have any inorganic material in it so if

275
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:09,388
the end these bioplastics are seen as

276
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,758
inorganic material whether that's right

277
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:13,860
or wrong it's currently seen as

278
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,629
inorganic material so when this material

279
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,550
comes in they have to separate it out

280
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:20,698
put it in a different window if they're

281
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:24,059
gonna process it like that so it's a

282
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:25,769
very hard product process and because of

283
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,208
the legislation and needing to take more

284
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:30,959
organics and turn this stuff quickly

285
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:33,778
because we do not have enough organics

286
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,638
infrastructure in place some of these

287
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:37,919
facilities are going to a one-month

288
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,149
degradation so an aerated static pile

289
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,059
where they're going to cover the pile or

290
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:44,039
the pile has aeration coming through it

291
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:45,989
so it doesn't need to be turned and if

292
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,399
it does maybe like once or twice so

293
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,528
that's gonna be a one-month degradation

294
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,539
with a little bit of curing time so that

295
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:53,068
those compostable --zz if they're

296
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:55,740
certified at that six-month degradation

297
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:58,139
are not going to break down so these

298
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,190
products these the building of these

299
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,680
products need to have those

300
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,050
conversations with the processes that

301
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,729
are out there and saying okay can we can

302
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:07,919
we create a product that has a 1-month

303
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:11,159
degradation and can we certify for that

304
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:15,299
or can we prove that can we use more

305
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:18,110
fiber based material are there are there

306
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:20,938
rating is there a rating system for

307
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,230
degradation like how do I know like say

308
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:23,309
I'm going to the store or say I'm a

309
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,430
business that wants to find better

310
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:30,419
packaging like how do I know what it's

311
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:32,309
rated as for us and in the what we get

312
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,019
when in the waste industry when

313
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:35,549
something's brought to us the only thing

314
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,448
we get to see is if that thing's BPI

315
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:41,639
certified and that BPI certification I'm

316
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:43,289
not an expert in that area but they they

317
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,028
have to go through a testing third-party

318
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:47,039
testing system to find out what the

319
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:49,409
degradation of that is so they're gonna

320
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,419
know that the people but not everything

321
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:53,188
not everything is certified I'm guessing

322
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:56,068
not everything but a lot of compostable

323
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:58,588
where stuff is is becoming BPI certified

324
00:12:56,068 --> 00:13:00,389
baits expensive it's also expensive so

325
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,610
then it kind of prices some small

326
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:07,698
entrepreneurs out of the market not

327
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:07,699
surprising yeah exactly exactly yes

328
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:16,760
yes so there's anaerobic digestion as

329
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:19,159
well for organics ad facilities and the

330
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,960
current one that's in Paris California

331
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,759
one of the largest ones that we have is

332
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,350
not taking any bio plastics at this

333
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:28,189
moment they're not even taking fiber

334
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:30,710
based from what I've heard so even the

335
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,660
paralysis though is not scalable at this

336
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,710
moment so you're talking about a product

337
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:35,779
that you're like well maybe this will

338
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,360
work so we can we can create all this

339
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:40,759
product and let's put millions of

340
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,620
dollars into Krane paralysis versus

341
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,919
creating a product that works within the

342
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,570
system that exists so that that's an

343
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,129
issue that a lot of us in the zero-waste

344
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:53,150
community which I didn't define zero

345
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:54,980
waste but we we push for solutions

346
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:58,250
within the situation forces spending

347
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,539
millions of dollars to solve a problem

348
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:05,440
that could be solved by product redesign

349
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:08,029
yeah so what are you what do you think

350
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,980
you don't think that legislation to deal

351
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:11,870
with bio plastics is the answer that is

352
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,580
what I'm here you say what it sounds

353
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,519
like is if we could create like a

354
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:20,240
zero-waste system that that would be a

355
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:22,579
much better alternative i I think right

356
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,759
now I don't see a need to legislate on

357
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:29,120
the bio products at the moment because

358
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:32,240
if the if the businesses can work with

359
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,070
with the haulers and the processors and

360
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,450
and they can figure out the system

361
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:37,910
within I don't see why to legislate that

362
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:41,120
there's need for legislation when we

363
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:42,829
have situations where we have to tell at

364
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,690
the state level I am at the federal

365
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,340
level when we say you kind of need to

366
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,450
pull these organics out of the landfill

367
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,769
you know that because if we don't say

368
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,450
that the state doesn't say you need to

369
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:55,159
pull this organics out of the landfill

370
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,840
the jurisdictions the cities are not

371
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,750
going to tell the haulers you need to

372
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,360
start pushing organics collection and

373
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,519
recycling on the businesses in order to

374
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,080
pull this material the landfill and the

375
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,699
reason why we need to get organics out

376
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,230
of the landfill one organics is the

377
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,330
largest amount of material that goes to

378
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,139
a landfill it's about for state of

379
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:17,540
California it's 30 percent and then

380
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:21,199
that's all of it including food and food

381
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:25,399
accounts for 14% of the overall

382
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,920
the United States it's it's upwards of

383
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,419
almost 40% is organics in the landfill

384
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:36,250
and that creates a lot of methane and it

385
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:38,719
creates methane so organics in general

386
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:42,080
organics in general is just paper

387
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,990
usually comes out pretty high but it's

388
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,910
it's food foods if it's a massive amount

389
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,610
i just grouped their gangs together so

390
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:52,699
you've got your your tree waste your

391
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,740
yard trimmings your wood and your food

392
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,820
together and the reason why that's such

393
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,379
an important thing to target is our way

394
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,480
of a b32 we have climate legislation

395
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:04,700
strongest climate legislations ever been

396
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,690
passed in the United States that says

397
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,470
that we have to reduce our greenhouse

398
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:13,370
gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and

399
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:16,550
right now I think it's 2019 so but one

400
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:19,519
of the the second largest source of

401
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:21,139
anthropogenic methane gas in the state

402
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,059
of California and the third largest

403
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:25,399
source of anthropogenic methane gas in

404
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:29,989
the United States comes from the

405
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,939
organics in the landfill and personally

406
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,789
we had to legislate that because I don't

407
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:37,940
think anyone any business or any hauler

408
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:40,879
would have said yes we need to target

409
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,730
that I would really like to hear like

410
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,009
what your dream waste solution would

411
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:50,800
look like the concept of zero waste is

412
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:57,019
this weird not understood singular

413
00:16:50,799 --> 00:17:01,969
blogger pop idol popularize concept and

414
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:04,099
that's not what it is at all in 2004 and

415
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,630
then updated just recently the zero

416
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,649
waste international alliance which is

417
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,470
the one that came up with the first

418
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:12,500
peer-reviewed definition of zero waste

419
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:15,680
back in 2004 this is their their newest

420
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:18,470
update zero waste is the conservation of

421
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,420
all resources by means of responsible

422
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,759
production consumption reuse and

423
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,640
recovery of products packaging and

424
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:28,190
materials without burning and with no

425
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,860
discharges to land water or air that

426
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,470
threaten environment or human health so

427
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:37,158
my ideal and I prefer my little notes

428
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:39,650
my ideal right here my ideal solution is

429
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:44,360
something that's equitable that is

430
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,980
scalable and obtainable for for all of

431
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:48,979
the market and that does not cause harm

432
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,500
to any community that the community is

433
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,650
involved in the decisions on how that

434
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,619
that product might be cultivated within

435
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,450
that area or mind or whatever it might

436
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,129
be that there's full corporate

437
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,720
responsibility that the responsibility

438
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:06,110
does not always put back on the consumer

439
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,429
um it's managed locally the waste of it

440
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:10,879
is managed locally with local

441
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:17,240
infrastructure and that there's a I want

442
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:21,110
I want B core certification with zero

443
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,788
waste application to it so I want there

444
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:24,859
to be zero waste checklist that

445
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:26,929
considers all aspects of a pre-imposed

446
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:29,359
of a business worked into the B

447
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:32,809
corporation certification that's good

448
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,099
yes that's a great idea I think I can

449
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:37,609
you know some of those things can be

450
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:42,829
attainable like it's like just a really

451
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:44,689
comprehensive comprehensive way to for

452
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:48,519
any business to work is to just consider

453
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,519
all of those all those things

454
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:57,799
you know I as a product developer

455
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:02,269
consumer and working like let's say last

456
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:08,388
year in the neighborhood right st

457
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:11,749
neighbors to be the plastic cup whatever

458
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:14,839
we needed t-shirts to make rugs and all

459
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:25,639
that i learned a lot about how

460
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:29,028
disconnected and how we discuss how to

461
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:32,748
connect it we are from each other and

462
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:36,470
the other thing is how people just don't

463
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:42,440
think about so you know we just entered

464
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:46,329
supermarket so as much as we talk and

465
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:49,308
I've been working with cycling cycling

466
00:19:46,329 --> 00:20:00,918
innovation material forever

467
00:19:49,308 --> 00:20:06,138
for 20 years and I go to yeah so time

468
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:10,669
goes by and go to Trader Joe's it's

469
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:13,908
there all the supermarket all the class

470
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:18,799
of second to nothing it's like one Apple

471
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:22,159
you know one thing it's all so in this

472
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,599
zero waste speaking is there possibility

473
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,149
to have like

474
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:33,379
that really goes into the manufacturing

475
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:39,599
or the retailers that we can have below

476
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:42,120
package because if we change those I

477
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:46,019
have thought about doing like with my

478
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:57,028
neighborhood including all the plastic

479
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:58,288
from so that's yeah that's like the

480
00:20:57,028 --> 00:21:01,048
corporates corporate social

481
00:20:58,288 --> 00:21:03,658
responsibility of designing designing

482
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:12,990
for the end in mind right and cradle to

483
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:19,590
cradle kind of mentality cradle I'm it's

484
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:20,819
there but those bad so there's extended

485
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:22,859
so there's extended producer

486
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:25,710
responsibility legislation it's very

487
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:27,449
hard to pass they finally after ten

488
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,659
years got to take back program for

489
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:33,720
pharmaceuticals and sharps it took ten

490
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:36,000
years because of the pushback from the

491
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,129
industry that controls that market and

492
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,808
so you're totally right and we're also

493
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:41,158
not only disconnected with each other

494
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:42,240
we're disconnected with our product

495
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,929
we're disconnected with our earth were

496
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,259
disconnected with the resources so we

497
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:51,090
look at places like in the UK where

498
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:52,829
they're saying you know we're we're

499
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:54,269
going to move towards something where

500
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:55,439
the products have to be made out of

501
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:57,808
something that was recyclable

502
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,070
compostable or reusable Berkeley just

503
00:21:57,808 --> 00:22:03,509
passed a an ordinance that said if

504
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:04,408
you're going to be a restaurant in

505
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:07,259
Berkeley

506
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:09,480
you have to charge 25 cents for any

507
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:12,389
disposables that leave your place of

508
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,480
business and all of you businesses have

509
00:22:12,388 --> 00:22:17,339
to have reusables on-site that you can

510
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,409
no longer use disposables so there are

511
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:22,829
small pockets of that sort of happening

512
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:25,409
it's harder California is a little bit

513
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:27,628
easier the larger the country is even

514
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:28,649
harder but it's harder it's really hard

515
00:22:27,628 --> 00:22:31,199
to push on extended producer

516
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:33,058
responsibility laws so while those are

517
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,129
happening while we have entities work in

518
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:35,490
that area we as consumers also have two

519
00:22:35,128 --> 00:22:37,109
key

520
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,329
pounding that pavement because I know

521
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:41,729
personally from working with Trader

522
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:43,829
Joe's that they are hearing you and they

523
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,200
are looking at phasing out unnecessary

524
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:48,418
plastic within their stores hopefully

525
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,058
they do it and it's not like just

526
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,950
something they're saying at this moment

527
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:56,250
but it's it comes from all aspects but

528
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:58,830
just know that plastic pollution that

529
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,569
plastic consumption the single-use

530
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:03,599
disposable consumption even though you

531
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:07,048
are choosing to buy that it's not your

532
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,699
fault it is their fault it is the it's

533
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:11,480
the corporations that are giving it to

534
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,480
us as fault

535
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:22,869
