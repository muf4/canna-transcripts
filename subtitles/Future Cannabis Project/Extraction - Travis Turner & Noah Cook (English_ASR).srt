very don corleone in kind of a way okay

42
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:24,829
so you guys first of all where is your

43
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:27,139
facility Boyle Heights just Soto and

44
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,000
Olympic on the east side of our south

45
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:34,159
east side of downtown right by the Sears

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,430
buildings yeah 15,000 square feet yeah

47
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,439
our if you ever want to come shoot

48
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,790
something cool like our manufacturing

49
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,169
facility is probably something outside

50
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:48,229
of what most people get to see in the

51
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:52,518
space it's 5,000 square feet of

52
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:54,619
automated plant processing so you're

53
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,329
basically dumping in input on one end

54
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,719
and you're pumping out oil on the other

55
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:02,540
end and pretty much goes like that all

56
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:05,289
day long every day it's we we can do

57
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:07,879
about 5,000 pounds of processing a day

58
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:09,560
in that facility and we're building

59
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:16,549
another one in Compton that can do

60
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:18,289
40,000 pounds a day of him processing it

61
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:20,409
will be all him focused yeah yeah it's

62
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:27,019
gonna have a hemp license rather than a

63
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:30,159
cannabis it's done a microphone with

64
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:34,849
your facility you're processing for

65
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,818
joints for flour for oil for cartridges

66
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:40,068
for live resin rot like everything so

67
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,899
yeah the only thing we can't do we're a

68
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:43,280
type six manufacturer so those live

69
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,579
resin products and stuff things that

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,019
take like butane propane or some sort of

71
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:48,769
hydrocarbon extract like we don't mess

72
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,170
with those right now

73
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:55,280
I guess so hydrocarbon is basically the

74
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:59,839
only thing you don't do you do co2 you

75
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,189
do did you solve unless we can we have a

76
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,870
license for it just not in our

77
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,189
wheelhouse at the moment no one's asked

78
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,590
us to do it but we're totally equipped

79
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:07,669
to and we can do that we just don't make

80
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,519
any of those products right now like

81
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:13,189
we're both like purist at heart and we I

82
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,569
love like dry sift rosin I think it's

83
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:19,449
the best one of the best products on the

84
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:19,449
market solvent list products at least

85
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:27,090
supplement list is it's just really hard

86
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:28,709
to that's nice what do i I love bubble

87
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:30,839
it's how I cut my teeth about eight

88
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:34,589
years ago I was making bubble hash and

89
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:43,349
washing machines in my kitchen humble

90
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:55,019
talking trees farm well part of humble

91
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:57,360
are they in yeah smells great

92
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,668
yeah my beginnings was purely making

93
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,629
bubble so I had to side-by-side wash

94
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:05,099
machines and for cultivation Wow yeah so

95
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,810
I cultivated for a long time first

96
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,660
around I've been but I've been

97
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,668
cultivating for about twelve years I had

98
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,620
I have been up to this point I stopped

99
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:16,459
about four years well no I haven't

100
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,199
stopped actually we said one more I

101
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:21,120
forget about it sometimes it's shoved

102
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,810
away in a corner somewhere

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,449
yeah we're in Humboldt so I moved Arcada

104
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,639
I grown a little bit you know in

105
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,620
Southern California moved to Humboldt

106
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,650
went back to school for communications

107
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,939
journalism degree at Humboldt State and

108
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:38,158
as soon as I moved up there I was like

109
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,500
oh this is actually the the mecca of

110
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:43,339
everything about ten years ago I moved

111
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,509
to 11 years ago moved to Humboldt and

112
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:47,339
I'm like oh this is like the mecca of

113
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:48,740
everything and this is definitely what I

114
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:56,848
want to do with the rest of my life and

115
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:58,889
got roped in yeah did start about eight

116
00:05:56,848 --> 00:06:01,379
years ago started doing bubble like I

117
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:05,970
said to to wash machines and a big

118
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:14,699
barrel and with with bubble bags and ice

119
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:17,570
ice hash and yeah but back then like you

120
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:21,150
could go people just drop off like

121
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:22,709
pounds and I mean 40 50 hundred yeah

122
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:24,120
back that nobody did like they were

123
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:26,129
happy if you came and got it off their

124
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,870
farm because they you know back then you

125
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:28,620
if you found trim on a farm it was the

126
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,180
same as fine

127
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,090
you know each one of those pounds of

128
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,860
trim counted as a pound of flour so you

129
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:38,189
get the jail time of like you know

130
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,530
whatever that weight was and so people

131
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:43,639
just give it to me for a trim with a

132
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:50,639
street value of hundred thousand dollars

133
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:54,240
right how they how they calculated it so

134
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:58,319
yeah after that I got into open blasting

135
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,439
I spent a summer on a farm outside of

136
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:09,240
Garberville just going through butane

137
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:12,899
cans everyday in glass PVC first time in

138
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,610
Michigan yeah in Humboldt like that you

139
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,310
just had access to that kind of stuff

140
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,689
like you know I had like four or five

141
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,579
different glass blowers and they would

142
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:24,180
make they made me a set of tubes like

143
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:26,819
the PVC is actually like that's what got

144
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:32,639
me away from cultivating and actually

145
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:38,189
got is like I was starting my first my

146
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:42,329
first personal grow in 2009 in Michigan

147
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:45,000
way they had legalized medicinal in 2008

148
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:48,870
I was doing my own grow and having a

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,180
hard time in a under about 2000 Watts

150
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:56,579
and a little tent and my dad had a buddy

151
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,280
that it was also a grower and he was my

152
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:02,159
first caregiver and he we went in and he

153
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,769
had cooked me pulled off a bunch of fan

154
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,640
leaves cooked him in the oven

155
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:10,829
blast them through PVC and and basically

156
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,689
melted this black tar onto a bowl and we

157
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:14,639
set there and smoked it and I'd gotten

158
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:17,310
higher than I've ever been

159
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,460
and THC and there's like well there's

160
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,168
something something to this yeah I and

161
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:26,279
I'm not very good at growing right now

162
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:41,458
so let's just so let's try it out and my

163
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:43,828
first you guys yeah we also own a piece

164
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:47,069
of that business but yeah we contract

165
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:48,809
manufacturer for them as well so like

166
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:55,920
one of the things we when we pick up

167
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:59,159
brands we take a bit of the equity yeah

168
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:02,219
it's been cool it's you know I spent

169
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,838
years of my life driving to places to

170
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,440
pick up trim to bring it back to our

171
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,320
facility to process with mixed results

172
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,019
and one I don't know when but like

173
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,480
someday one day we just decided like hey

174
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:18,120
let's just actually sit here as much as

175
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,399
possible how do we get people to bring

176
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,839
us the trim and then we do what we do

177
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,309
with it and then just give back the

178
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,320
results and they pay us to do that

179
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:26,729
and that kind of changed into our model

180
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,430
and then we found people who are into

181
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,810
like doing toll processing and contract

182
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:32,219
manufacturing that didn't have either

183
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:34,528
didn't have a license or didn't have

184
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,339
some part of the puzzle a big thing is a

185
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:39,990
like like we were talking about people

186
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,160
didn't realize the farmers didn't

187
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,899
realize the value of the trim

188
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,208
they were only selling their pounds and

189
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,549
they were selling their flour and then

190
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,989
they didn't realize the value now you're

191
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:53,370
getting more educated farmers that

192
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,649
realize the value of the the stuff they

193
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,169
were throwing away and they would much

194
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:59,159
rather be involved in the end product

195
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:02,039
and

196
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:03,899
you know the advantageous sources of

197
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,879
income that go through it instead of

198
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:08,970
just you know selling that trim they

199
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:12,480
would much rather get a hand in the

200
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,340
market of concentrates and start

201
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,210
producing a product that now you know

202
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:22,850
that's getting the Ally out of it yeah

203
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:25,139
Dominic so they down some products yeah

204
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,730
you're right that is like that that's

205
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:27,990
where the the conversation kind of

206
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,389
wrapped on we you know we came from

207
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,070
small farmer stock like you know people

208
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:34,230
that were doing less than an acre you

209
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,330
know like quarter acre or something like

210
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,800
in the same garden as they grew their

211
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,090
vegetables and everything else he

212
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,250
counted them out in the sticks and

213
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:44,100
humble and that was kind of like always

214
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,870
our our thing like you know where's the

215
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,810
value that we bring to those people and

216
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,360
we thought you know hey let's let's get

217
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:53,129
them to have some participation in the

218
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,960
downstream economic so like where these

219
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:56,370
products are going to like that's what

220
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,170
they're missing that's why farmers get

221
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:03,090
commoditized and stuck in these little

222
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:04,740
small boxes and yeah we've figured out a

223
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,350
way to we're like hey we charge a fee

224
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,299
but and and and hey no problem we'll

225
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,759
even sell this end product for you and

226
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:14,219
you get part of those economics down you

227
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:19,559
know after it's sold yeah I mean it's

228
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:23,310
basically monetizing your waste streams

229
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:25,709
and it it goes further it as the science

230
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:28,589
catch it catches up to the industry then

231
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,960
we're able to realize that there really

232
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:35,210
isn't too much waste and I mean we can

233
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:38,460
we can pull there now we're looking at

234
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,960
for our distillate a distillate residue

235
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,820
and there's people that are extremely

236
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,450
interested in that and making bio

237
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,060
plastics

238
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:50,129
and your biomass is I mean for one it

239
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:53,099
could be animal feed it could be burned

240
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:57,059
for energy with inside the plant the

241
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,730
these are just streams of value that was

242
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:01,199
considered waste that we used and used

243
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,190
to have to pay to get rid of and now

244
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,300
there's more and more companies that are

245
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,860
realizing the value of these products

246
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,979
and creating creating businesses around

247
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,879
relieving these waste streams

248
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:18,039
and also making valuable products out of

249
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:20,200
them well on that topic there's one

250
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:22,539
thing to recognize the economic value of

251
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,850
the fiber and all these other things

252
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:26,860
it's another thing to actually have the

253
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,259
infrastructure in place to currently do

254
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,120
something about it so you guys are about

255
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:34,720
to start processing hemp right yep

256
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,669
you're gonna have so much material

257
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:44,320
that's not going into the CVD

258
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:46,449
isolate so where are we today with for

259
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,540
example turning into plastic and the

260
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:58,960
fuel and to rope and clothing and I got

261
00:12:52,539 --> 00:13:01,569
to go to a hemp show in NBC about eight

262
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:04,150
months ago and I was blown away

263
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,750
you know I I've been pushing to get into

264
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:06,970
that market

265
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,940
British up and be yeah Brit British

266
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:13,360
Columbia Canada at the University of

267
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,590
Vancouver and they you know those waste

268
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,919
streams exist

269
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:20,950
they haven't been scaled so for instance

270
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,689
there's a guy creating hempcrete you

271
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,680
know that is stronger than concrete

272
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,660
there's like there was a guy up there

273
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:29,589
that was making batteries out of hemp

274
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:31,029
and biochar there was obviously a bunch

275
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,879
of different fiber guys up there that

276
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,980
were doing everything from you know most

277
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:40,090
of the molding inside car doors now are

278
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,769
all hemp based you know there's a bunch

279
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,019
of really cool products but it hasn't

280
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:46,120
been scaled yet and this was in Canada I

281
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:48,399
think Canada is probably like five years

282
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,970
ahead of us as far as large-scale hemp

283
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,970
production goes

284
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,100
murder where the cultivation is

285
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,509
happening right like yeah I think you

286
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,420
know the oil industry would be an

287
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:02,669
analogy where you have certain you know

288
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:05,969
refining extraction

289
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:08,969
you know transportation distribution to

290
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,279
the refinery it really comes down to

291
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,800
logistics of moving material and I mean

292
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,769
if you could move if you could have a

293
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:21,569
mobile lab that comes to the farm get

294
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:23,819
stuff into crude and the oil the biomass

295
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,000
is it's the biggest taker of energy for

296
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:30,030
for moving around it's it's it's hefty

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,940
for what we're pulling out of it if you

298
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:35,220
can get those valuable space if you can

299
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,920
get those targeted molecules out in the

300
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,100
field then you don't have to worry about

301
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:44,969
other processing down the line you can

302
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,519
you can send your your waist down for

303
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:51,440
fiber processing or plastic processing

304
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,629
but if you can separate things closer

305
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,160
closer to the source it's gonna reduce

306
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,899
cost but as you get to these more

307
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,259
precious things say is say if you're

308
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,740
incinerating your biomass and you're

309
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:04,379
doing

310
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:08,029
graphene production like it takes

311
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:10,919
nothing to ship you know a gram of

312
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:13,199
potentially graphene rich material to

313
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:18,500
you know the other side of the world to

314
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:21,300
actually do research but it really it's

315
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:25,549
logistical II it's the big challenges

316
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:28,609
getting the target molecules mmm

317
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:31,589
processed early and then moving the

318
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,820
waste streams in a proper direction to

319
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,780
where you don't you're not processing

320
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:38,520
them in several different manufacturing

321
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,980
areas you want to do most of the stuff

322
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:46,500
at the field and then take the different

323
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:50,159
materials the waste streams out to the

324
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:54,690
the other processors and biomass is the

325
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:56,759
the biggest the the what's 10 per single

326
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:01,200
grain on it yeah they're you know going

327
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:03,509
from going from biomass as a whole to

328
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,690
crude you're cutting out ninety percent

329
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:06,730
of your weight if

330
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,750
more so that's the logistical

331
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,370
interestingly though right now which is

332
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,730
kind of follows along with what we've

333
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:19,600
been how our thought process works when

334
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:22,060
we make decisions up but the price point

335
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,970
on some of those bulk cannabinoids are

336
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:26,500
both testable quotas is still so good

337
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,200
that a lot of people aren't thinking

338
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,470
about that the logistics cost is really

339
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,390
like almost nothing compared to the to

340
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,769
the margin if if you're a single source

341
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:37,830
provider right you're a farm that's

342
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:39,850
going straight into your own a

343
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,820
manufacturing facility even if you have

344
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,879
to transport thousands of miles to a

345
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:49,660
facility the economics are so good right

346
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:51,909
now in this market that it doesn't play

347
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:53,439
a big role it's not it's not a cost

348
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:56,110
factor that you really like oh my god we

349
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,300
got to make sure it costs twenty six

350
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,519
hundred dollars to do a 40-foot

351
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:01,719
container on the back of a semi truck

352
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,029
and you can fit about twenty five

353
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,220
thousand pounds of material in the back

354
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:07,838
of that truck and so if you think you

355
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,480
know you're getting twenty kilos off of

356
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:13,629
every thousand pounds that's four

357
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,759
hundred and something kilos of finished

358
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,920
oil you get off that that twenty five

359
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,259
thousand pounds or more you know and

360
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,650
that that equals that twenty five

361
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:27,220
thousand pounds equals you know and in

362
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:29,440
revenue you know millions and millions

363
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,180
of dollars worth of CBD isolate or

364
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,850
full-spectrum distillate or something

365
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,529
like that so right now the people aren't

366
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:37,779
even thinking about that because it's

367
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:39,819
you know but we our whole thing is like

368
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:41,319
efficiency we reuse all our ethanol over

369
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:43,389
and over again and we clean it every

370
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:44,799
time and we've taken away some of the

371
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,140
heating and cooling elements of the

372
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,359
process to make make it cleaner and and

373
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,800
more efficient you know and I think in

374
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,649
the same way eventually like Noah said

375
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,450
like you know farmers want to grow

376
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:58,390
plants and cut those plants down it's in

377
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:01,240
that somewhere but with him specifically

378
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:03,040
cannabis too it's more complex you know

379
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,620
you're drying for days you want to dry

380
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:09,909
in a certain way to preserve your yield

381
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:12,149
and so I think some expertise or people

382
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,700
getting into that market of harvesting

383
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,879
separating stalk and stem for fiber

384
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,440
production from from flower

385
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:21,658
those are the things I think people are

386
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,058
looking at now for that take that hit in

387
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:25,859
two years from now when everybody their

388
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,388
sisters growing hemp and like it's just

389
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:28,589
a big commodity and yeah I could imagine

390
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:30,928
efficiencies are really gonna start

391
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:33,269
mattering I could imagine that you know

392
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:36,690
like feed corn was probably a challenge

393
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:39,509
in getting a getting good separated corn

394
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,700
without tons of husks and biomass so

395
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:44,069
that's you know low and low in

396
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,989
nutritional value and and those are the

397
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:50,608
things that we are starting to look at

398
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:52,288
now is the is just trying to reduce

399
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:55,259
those efficiencies because eventually

400
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:57,239
the the price for CBD is going to be is

401
00:18:55,259 --> 00:19:00,720
you get more big players in the game

402
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:02,038
it's going to drop significantly so to

403
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,200
be that it should be like if it's

404
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,929
exactly to make it make it available to

405
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,470
everybody it should be it should be

406
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:12,538
available to anybody with a buck in

407
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:27,058
their pocket to get a little CBD in

408
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:29,878
their system and and it's that's the

409
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:31,378
thought the thought right now it's I

410
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:33,839
mean we haven't built it we haven't

411
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:36,418
built our own out and we haven't come

412
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,329
along a design right now we're playing

413
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:41,999
with we're playing within the confines

414
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:44,699
of what's what we've been given

415
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:47,519
here in the state of California you have

416
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,999
to have a physical address to be using

417
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,548
these solvents it's not that's not

418
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:55,589
really can transport like it's not easy

419
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:57,148
for a regular guy to transport you know

420
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:58,738
ten thousand gallons of ethanol in the

421
00:19:57,148 --> 00:20:00,868
back of a tanker truck you know yeah

422
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,058
from one place down a dirt road to some

423
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:04,168
other place and and I think in the long

424
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:07,608
run when you start talking about

425
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:10,940
consumer goods specifically you know

426
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:12,839
cooking it up you know in your garage

427
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,759
while you're baking it in your oven

428
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,019
inside the house like that so that

429
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,788
probably is not going to happen for too

430
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:20,878
much longer you know if it's still

431
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:23,128
happening at all and so where you're

432
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:27,019
doing some processing could be an issue

433
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:29,759
you know like taking a non FDA certified

434
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:31,140
you know tractor-trailer and

435
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,779
doing that work on the field I don't

436
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,840
know if that works long term maybe it

437
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:39,210
does for obviously for him and a fiber

438
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:41,970
fiber but maybe for Pharma or

439
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:51,269
nutritional supplements out of it it

440
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:55,799
flies it is yes yeah we we really prefer

441
00:20:51,269 --> 00:21:01,139
ethanol it's it's a renewable solvent we

442
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:05,609
it's extremely aggressive and it

443
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,830
I mean slightly is mmm significantly

444
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:10,769
less dangerous than dealing with butane

445
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:14,429
it's not as volatile as a solvent it's

446
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:15,599
not in general like yeah it's aggressive

447
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:22,650
as a salt but it might make you

448
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:25,649
aggressive yeah but it definitely is

449
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:28,800
it's not the easiest solvent to work

450
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:31,700
with and we've learned that yeah we've

451
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,950
learned a lot with being forced into the

452
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:37,559
the corner that we are with our six a

453
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:40,009
license we can only do non volatile

454
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:43,970
solvents and we were really lucky that

455
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:48,869
that ethanol was lumped into that group

456
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:51,180
if it wasn't we'd be dealing with a lot

457
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:53,929
of co2 and rosin presses but not be able

458
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:58,650
to do the industrial scale of

459
00:21:53,930 --> 00:22:01,650
cannabinoid extraction that we do it

460
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:04,080
does take an aggressive solvent and with

461
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:06,810
the high pressure systems that co2 has

462
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,220
to use it there's very very low

463
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:16,019
throughput compared to what we can do

464
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:18,360
with ethanol safely each solvent and

465
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:20,779
like checkbox like different

466
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,629
capabilities or what they're good for

467
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:26,970
large scale volume is one of them yes

468
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,310
that's co2 I mean obviously bras and

469
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:32,490
presses you're doing like yeah six inch

470
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,139
that's cotton gin yeah so yeah but you

471
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,289
can get some of the best products ever

472
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,720
out of

473
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:42,009
you know solvent lists you know water

474
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:44,980
washes and then drive sifting and then

475
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:47,589
and then rosin and then our ERISA name

476
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,559
with separating th CA and and then also

477
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:53,919
tossing out your ear your rosin there

478
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:57,250
letting it stratify and like the BHO

479
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,800
guys too like that's a lot of work and

480
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:04,299
it makes the best extra extra action

481
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:06,759
might in my opinion but if we want to

482
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:10,119
get cannabinoids to everybody that's out

483
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:15,670
there that needs them there's not enough

484
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:17,649
rosin presses in the world either that

485
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,720
someone brings you or like if you ever

486
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:23,230
go to a retail shop and just say like

487
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:26,970
wow whatever these guys are doing I want

488
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:31,839
to learn what it is cuz this is crazy we

489
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:34,509
we we love rosin or the solvent list

490
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:39,909
rosin like hi we would go to you know

491
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:43,599
jungle boys has be like dry sift dry

492
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:45,279
sift rosin as well and it's in yeah

493
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,639
it's one of the best products ever if

494
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,799
it's a super craft product and we pay

495
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,500
the extra price for it I think all those

496
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:56,079
technologies have a specific user

497
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,210
function you know rot you know rosin

498
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:02,319
presses meet that criteria for people

499
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:04,539
who really want the best extract as far

500
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:13,480
as flavor as far as capturing the

501
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:16,180
essence of that specific fee know it for

502
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,640
sure it costs $100 1/2 gram or sometimes

503
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:21,519
you know 150 dollars out or a gram and

504
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:26,550
yeah it is the I would say it's the the

505
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:28,960
most top-shelf yeah teak product there

506
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:33,960
there's people now that are really

507
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,769
starting to do great things with with

508
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,200
hydrocarbons I mean they've been doing

509
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:42,160
great things with hydrocarbons but now

510
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,340
they've really learned how to refine and

511
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,940
I've seen a few people actually pulling

512
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:50,730
really strong terpene profiles from

513
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,170
hydrocarbon extracts colorless like yeah

514
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,170
there's a terpene profiles with

515
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:58,440
colorless oil like using hydrocarbons

516
00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:09,058
and really good good flavor profiles

517
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:10,500
yeah I mean I mostly know I the for

518
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:14,599
terpenes that I was really impressed

519
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:18,269
with dr. Jack Hughes on Instagram he

520
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:21,109
he's really spent a lot of time at

521
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:24,960
preserving terpenes and and polling and

522
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:27,149
distilling terpenes out of crude

523
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,829
extracts to in keeping good profiles

524
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:32,429
he's just put so much time into that

525
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:34,289
over over a lot we met him he was one of

526
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:36,960
the first trade shows we did I actually

527
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:41,909
just found this business card more we

528
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:45,090
saw him at at Vegas Vegas as well but we

529
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:47,370
saw him at hemp con in San Bernardino

530
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:50,519
they were they jet he was in the Jenny

531
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:54,058
extracts booth that was him that was him

532
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:57,240
yeah yeah I can't believe that I knew

533
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:59,700
that my goodness but yeah I mean the

534
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,579
cool thing is we've watched a whole

535
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,370
bunch of people like level up over the

536
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:08,369
course of the last five years on

537
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:10,229
Instagram like so many people have gone

538
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:11,669
to a new level of their understanding of

539
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,069
how they want to interact with the plant

540
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:17,490
and and a lot of people have their own

541
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:20,039
little bubbles too they they they find

542
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:25,920
their their niche so breaking dabs on

543
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:28,428
Instagram is a he's really when the

544
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:33,090
short path distillation game came up he

545
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:35,580
put a lot of energy into just figuring

546
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:37,859
out all the the variables and how to

547
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:38,549
make great oil and and increase

548
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:41,279
throughputs

549
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:42,990
and writing it all down it's just so

550
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,678
huge in this industry for people to like

551
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:48,779
write it down create a a very specific

552
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,940
SOP and then so people can duplicate

553
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:53,339
that work exactly like that then it's

554
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,980
and verify the results you know so it

555
00:26:53,339 --> 00:27:00,069
becomes a standard yes

556
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:02,860
he's a confessor he's a consultant that

557
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:04,750
that was very very generous and

558
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:06,939
everything that he's put online

559
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:10,028
eventually it right now he's worked

560
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:13,630
towards you know commoditizing ism in

561
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:16,000
some way but it's great it and but that

562
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:19,028
I don't know anybody that runs a short

563
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,730
path that doesn't you know tip their hat

564
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:33,548
to what he what he did for the industry

565
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:36,099
and and another another yes that his hot

566
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:39,638
condenser tech the braking dabs hot

567
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:41,109
condenser tech was absolutely a ground

568
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:42,729
breaker for the distillation of

569
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:47,849
cannabinoids because people started

570
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:51,880
realizing that they started selectively

571
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:56,740
selectively condensing things before it

572
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:58,419
was all you vaporize vaporize their

573
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,329
cannabinoids and everything that comes

574
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:03,730
up you condense it all and then you just

575
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:07,480
you don't want anything to bypass and

576
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:09,970
end up in your trash so he was the one

577
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,329
that realized that there will be things

578
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:15,700
that code is still and that there's ways

579
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:19,808
of increasing your condenser

580
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:22,210
temperatures to let them bypass your the

581
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:24,099
drop down for your your oil and they'll

582
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,528
continue as a vapor and then they'll get

583
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:30,459
deposited further down your path yeah

584
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:32,440
but not in your flask for targeted soil

585
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,000
so basically in distillation if I could

586
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,190
just like cut this down a laser this is

587
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,409
actually basically in distillation you

588
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:41,528
have a boiling flash you pour your your

589
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:43,690
crude oil into this boiling flask and as

590
00:28:41,528 --> 00:28:47,619
it gets to specific temperatures it

591
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:49,630
fractions off by vaporizing different

592
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:52,359
compounds inside that boiling class so

593
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:55,149
there's THC CBD all your cannabinoids

594
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:56,769
all your terpenes depending on their

595
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:58,750
specific boiling point is when they

596
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,919
would fraction off of that main body of

597
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:05,648
oil

598
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:07,960
so what breaking dabs did was most

599
00:29:05,648 --> 00:29:10,539
people just had a cold fluid running

600
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,880
through their condenser so once that

601
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:14,710
oil vapor would hit the condenser it

602
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,820
would this is just so for people who

603
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,009
don't know this stuff I just want to

604
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:20,529
like give them this this short story hit

605
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:22,180
that condenser and it would cool it to a

606
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:26,619
point where it would Ries elyda Phi

607
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:28,570
right and then and then it would it

608
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:31,000
would land on a there was a flask that

609
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:33,429
would come off of that path and this is

610
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,579
all done under very deep vacuum right

611
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:41,080
but you for cannabinoids specifically

612
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:43,419
correct me if I'm wrong they don't they

613
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,579
don't need to be so cold to read that

614
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,740
they're volatile in the sense they want

615
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:49,029
to go back their natural state is oil so

616
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,819
you don't have to bring the temperature

617
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:53,680
up or down so you've got a really little

618
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:56,759
bit of vapor pressure very low vapor

619
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,680
pressure is the better term for it

620
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:02,980
so this hot condenser tech allowed you

621
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:06,549
to pass more garbage and just really

622
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:20,140
collect a very much cleaner cannabinoid

623
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:25,319
fraction into your collection flask Kota

624
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:28,210
Stills like so yeah so like selectively

625
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:32,109
Rican dancing was something that people

626
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:34,269
started it that it it jogged something

627
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:38,199
in a lot of people's my brains and got

628
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:41,740
them thinking on another level and gray

629
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,390
wolf to like yeah of an open like there

630
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,970
was a feel for it a there's a couple

631
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:48,700
guys who are like awesome in this tech

632
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:52,750
community too because they have openly

633
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:54,700
like upset a lot of people but like kept

634
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,640
this small band of people in the

635
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:00,759
technology side side of cannabis or

636
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,230
specifically in processing kind of

637
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:04,089
hanging on to each other like we all

638
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,130
follow each other IG we see each other

639
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:09,189
at all these events there it's not a

640
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:11,620
huge group of people and so gray wolf

641
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:14,410
and he doesn't even he's not even on

642
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:15,319
Instagram which is yeah but he he's an

643
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,240
old codger that

644
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:22,819
but he's been designing closed loop

645
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:25,339
systems for well he he's an engineer and

646
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:29,000
the closed loop systems he basically

647
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:32,449
owes open source them on the internet so

648
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,519
people could so it would destroy the

649
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,009
ability to make patents around them so

650
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:39,079
then people could actually yeah make the

651
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:42,170
machines themselves so he open source

652
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:44,269
them very to just make sure that people

653
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:47,300
would be able to make closed-loop butane

654
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:50,509
designs and don't know if you're

655
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:55,240
familiar with connoisseur concentrates

656
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:57,259
the mr. extractor and it's a it's a

657
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:02,720
about to say something that might cause

658
00:31:57,259 --> 00:32:05,629
drama there we you might uh there was a

659
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,670
big video series about how this company

660
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,350
had owned all these patents and they

661
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:11,150
tried to patent this stuff but it's

662
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:15,909
really they're not enforceable patents

663
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:21,730
and there's kind of Supercop kind of

664
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:25,550
they they got it and he was he's made a

665
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:30,620
pretty funny video series of him up and

666
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:35,480
this big know drew hey that's all i know

667
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:37,429
i'm as drew and with a couple of pretty

668
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,009
blondes and him in front of a desk

669
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:41,840
overseeing like la or something and he

670
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:44,900
talks about and he gives like a an

671
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,759
hour-long series about how he's he owns

672
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,000
all the patents he's gonna be the future

673
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:54,740
of the industry and it was like it was

674
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,980
pretty cringy yes it was a groaner yeah

675
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:02,539
the whole thing yeah and i believe that

676
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,910
he's actually the gray wolf has been

677
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:10,700
sued for some of the stuff that he put

678
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:12,980
out he's had to deal with no actually

679
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,730
skunk farm had gotten bought from

680
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,980
another company and there's some really

681
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:19,048
stuff going on around the open-sourcing

682
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,360
of that but people have attacked Great

683
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:23,759
Wolf for what he has tried open-source

684
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:26,389
and he's been like copied all over the

685
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:29,400
industry like if you see a closed-loop

686
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,960
butane extractor like something on it's

687
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:44,759
probably like taken from one of his

688
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:48,539
designs almost everything out there is

689
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:51,179
based on a terminator design the

690
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:53,548
Terminator was you know a bunch of try

691
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:56,460
clamp spools you put the material in the

692
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:58,349
small ones they have passive passive

693
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,630
ones that use high you could just put in

694
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:03,990
hot water and ice and recover your

695
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:07,080
butane but it started out with just a

696
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:09,929
small little turbinator series on scum

697
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:13,289
farm research comm and then eventually

698
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:15,628
he started showing an automated mark to

699
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:19,789
version that they worked on to where it

700
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:23,069
was all pneumatic valves and then they

701
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:25,289
and then they they brought it as a mark

702
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,990
three was the basic design that

703
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:30,000
everybody's been working that the early

704
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:31,979
design for the mini closed-loop to

705
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,190
everybody worked on these are

706
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,980
hydrocarbon closed-loop extraction

707
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:41,570
systems so just getting the oil off the

708
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:44,849
plant yeah so basically you have a

709
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:48,119
column you pack the the material in the

710
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:50,460
column you pass butane through the

711
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:53,399
column at the bottom it's all collected

712
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:56,909
with oil under vacuum and then you heat

713
00:34:53,398 --> 00:35:01,049
that and you heat that bottom pot and

714
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:03,390
then you would pull all the solvent out

715
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:06,450
and then recover it with some type of

716
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:10,739
condenser or a pump that was the fun

717
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:15,379
days of using a peon HVAC recovery pumps

718
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:18,449
and then eventually it moved to TR 21

719
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:24,990
HVAC recovery pumps and then you had

720
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:26,079
companies come in like with the camera

721
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:29,919
over the name of the company but

722
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:34,150
see Emmy pol series of these little

723
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,039
stainless boxes for recovering like

724
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,900
mostly pubs like that was a that was the

725
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:39,610
first approved one I believe there's

726
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,349
that and then there's the new manic

727
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:44,140
Haskell's that were built around that as

728
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:46,269
well but these were these most the pumps

729
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:47,980
that were used for the first at least

730
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,929
five years four years we're doing it

731
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,139
we're all like the same kind of pumps

732
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:54,460
you would pump freon into your AC system

733
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:56,559
like that's the only thing that really

734
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,059
fit that marketplace and a lot of the

735
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,429
technology that you would use that would

736
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:03,400
be a lot safer was kind of like you had

737
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:05,679
to go through I was passive I mean a lot

738
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,809
of people you could just add heat and

739
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,519
add cooling and one slide trouble like

740
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:11,679
going to specific companies and saying

741
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,539
hey you know this is our company and

742
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,949
this is what we do and they wouldn't

743
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:16,389
even they wouldn't sell us anything

744
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:17,919
they've like no you don't fit the

745
00:36:16,389 --> 00:36:20,679
criteria of people that we sell our

746
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,110
products to with like pharmaceutical

747
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:26,199
supplies you know like even inert you

748
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:28,090
know getting bee bees yeah yeah getting

749
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:31,359
butane and mass you know like all these

750
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:35,289
laminate yeah and trying to do it

751
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:38,289
legally you know so yeah as much as

752
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:40,650
possible anyways we order through a

753
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:44,199
mcmaster-carr which is one of the best

754
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:46,660
industrial tool or parts of the fire

755
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:49,659
though and we have we have an account

756
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:51,579
there but we're aware that there's other

757
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:53,500
people around that have had multiple

758
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:54,730
accounts suspended just because they

759
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,530
know that they work with the industry

760
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:59,889
and they can't end its

761
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:02,769
and like they can't get their next day

762
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:04,119
part because their know they shut off

763
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:06,699
their account because their cannabis

764
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,650
guys and I mean even a couple months ago

765
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:10,119
we did a we're trying to do one of those

766
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:14,139
whiteboard videos where it's like

767
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:16,239
drawing little character yet and we got

768
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:18,940
like a week into the process with this

769
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:22,089
company in Utah and then the guy called

770
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:25,030
the designer or the guy who was in the

771
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:26,500
video called me and said yeah so we're

772
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,480
really sorry but we're gonna have to

773
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,480
discontinue working with you guys and it

774
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,730
was like what do you mean he's like yeah

775
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,050
the owner went to your website like it

776
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,809
was like this bad thing like our

777
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,640
websites super professional and like you

778
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:41,710
know describes what we do

779
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:46,269
and he's like yeah he's just not into

780
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:50,949
cannabis and I'm just like wow alright

781
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:52,900
well I don't want to pay company funny

782
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:56,230
enough that guy was like I just say from

783
00:37:52,900 --> 00:38:02,559
a personal standpoint I totally am into

784
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:05,559
what you guys yeah I also have this

785
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:07,599
little side business yeah super funny

786
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:10,360
but yeah it's still like a it's odd that

787
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:14,049
you know 33 states have some sort of

788
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:16,360
cannabis or hemp or CBD law in the books

789
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:18,940
right now it seems like it's moving

790
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,340
towards federal legalization sooner than

791
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,250
later so it's it's odd that like people

792
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:28,180
are still like it's the devil yeah and I

793
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:31,869
I still look for equipment I have to be

794
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:33,809
extremely when I'm sourcing equipment

795
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:36,519
especially through other countries I

796
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:40,059
have to be careful about what I'm

797
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:41,889
talking about and I just I don't I don't

798
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:43,449
tell them what kind of biomass or

799
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:45,549
anything like I only talk about

800
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:47,799
parameters or anything because I've

801
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:49,900
gotten so many times where people get

802
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,220
cold feet I don't get any more answering

803
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:55,389
from them but those are usually

804
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:57,189
large-scale suppliers when you have

805
00:38:55,389 --> 00:38:58,929
people that are more research based

806
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,450
those are the people that are more

807
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:04,539
willing to play and they they they're

808
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:08,049
really curious but when there's these

809
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:10,690
large companies that really don't need

810
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:15,010
to need to go outside and do extra sales

811
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:18,539
like like any any news as bad news to

812
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:22,750
them like just keep it functioning as is

813
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:25,570
their goal give me like one or two other

814
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:28,150
people who you would consider like

815
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:28,760
innovators and kind of what their

816
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,950
innovation

817
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:38,150
was one Dustin powers

818
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:43,359
Dustin powers is known as future 4200

819
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:47,780
future 4200 calm and on Instagram he's

820
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:54,610
one of the biggest proponents of open

821
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:57,350
sourcing he's created a huge forum and

822
00:39:54,610 --> 00:40:02,210
well it's actually a gang leader it's

823
00:39:57,349 --> 00:40:07,039
called The Good Life gang and it's just

824
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:08,980
a way to open up different networking

825
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:12,739
opportunities they put on different

826
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:15,760
networking events in different different

827
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:17,989
cities we've done over here inhalation

828
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,940
extraction mostly extraction but some

829
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:21,799
cultivation as well and certainly move

830
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:25,700
like towards other other parts of it

831
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,769
again like hemp is becoming a big focus

832
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:30,589
on that stuff as well but it started

833
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:33,739
from this dude going around and like

834
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:36,170
paying consultants to teach teach them

835
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:38,329
something and getting the SOP for that

836
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,059
specific thing and then and then he just

837
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:43,639
loaded up his website is a treasure

838
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:47,119
trove of kind of the history of how

839
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:49,129
people have been extracting and it was

840
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,349
and now all these other people just

841
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,660
upload their as like you know he was

842
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:59,029
doing news doing his own extraction you

843
00:40:53,659 --> 00:41:01,369
know he was just that he's a great

844
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:04,130
market kind of guy like well he worked

845
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:06,170
he worked for he worked at skunk farms

846
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,490
for a little while like so there there

847
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:11,570
was a connection there of this mentality

848
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:13,039
from like very wolf of opens you know

849
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:16,250
this dedication open source and then

850
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,110
like Dustin came out of that school of

851
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,260
thought it's for a little bit of

852
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:28,010
influence yeah and he he's actually

853
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:30,320
completely changed the like he the

854
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:34,280
website that he produced was something

855
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:37,730
that now it is the resource for all all

856
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:41,120
the cannabis extractors all the big

857
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:44,769
names and I'll now

858
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:50,029
lots of large-scale CBD companies and

859
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:52,400
you know big shiny china manufacturers

860
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:55,970
of equipment are all just getting in

861
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,280
there and I mean there's advertisement

862
00:41:55,969 --> 00:42:00,199
going on personally but it's not an

863
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,660
advertised website he's not taking money

864
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:05,659
off of it it's just this just treasure

865
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:10,579
trove of people just talking about ideas

866
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:13,429
unedited unedited and like sure he

867
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:15,500
catches plenty of flack for the things

868
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:16,940
that he puts out and he tries to promote

869
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,320
businesses as he knows that they're

870
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:23,659
legitimate and if things don't work out

871
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:25,880
he has to take the brunt of those things

872
00:42:23,659 --> 00:42:28,009
and by putting himself out there it's

873
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:32,090
just it's been a noble thing and how he

874
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:35,240
how he has given this information to so

875
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:37,400
many people and I'm like yes take a

876
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:39,349
beatin from time to time give me

877
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,210
something that you came across on that

878
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:46,730
site the past month that you forwarded

879
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:50,000
to him we were maybe Delta 10 oh yeah

880
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:54,679
Delta 10 stuff Delta time THC there's

881
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:59,780
now a huge thread regarding that and

882
00:42:54,679 --> 00:43:08,629
don't live when we had a fun little fort

883
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:13,370
a little for a layman's background so

884
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:15,200
depending specifically the old

885
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:19,969
everybody's different and I'll all have

886
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:24,319
their own special ways of a festival but

887
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:26,809
depending on where or how the different

888
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,030
pieces of the molecule are laid out you

889
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:32,090
you know the difference between THC

890
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:34,760
delta 9 and T and C a is th EA has a

891
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:39,519
carbolic acid molecule on its tail and

892
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:42,710
no boxer group carboxyl group and in

893
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:44,690
another thing there's Delta 8 THC which

894
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,800
has gotten really popular with the water

895
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,940
clear trend

896
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:52,130
and people would you know they would

897
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:54,139
throw a bunch of carbon and some acids

898
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,000
and stuff into their boiling flask and

899
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:58,969
then they'd start distilling it and it's

900
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,030
coming out beautiful water clear they

901
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:05,019
sent test results are they testing the

902
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:08,960
labs and then it's you know like very

903
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:11,239
low percentage of Delta 9 THC eventually

904
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,970
we started they got standards for Delta

905
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:16,039
88 see then started quantifying that

906
00:44:13,969 --> 00:44:20,239
there's more THC in this that there is

907
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:25,460
but then there's still a little missing

908
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:28,009
piece that like you'd see you know 60 to

909
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,829
70 80 percent cannabinoids and this

910
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:36,080
water clear stuff that you know it's all

911
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:38,869
cannabinoids and there's plenty of

912
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,549
isomers and stereo isomers of THC and

913
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:44,779
these are things that happen through

914
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:47,960
reaction their reactions that happen

915
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:51,830
through heating and the presence of

916
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,929
acids and bases and given the different

917
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:55,759
environmental things or what would spray

918
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:58,879
it on those so that that can actually be

919
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,570
a big indicator in what's happening into

920
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,880
the reactions as well so so good all

921
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:07,039
that distillation method we're like you

922
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,680
put stuff in a pot it boils at different

923
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:11,599
temperatures and all that well throw a

924
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:13,879
catalyst in that pot that you don't know

925
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,130
is there like you know people spray put

926
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,480
sulfur on their plants or people you

927
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:20,119
know certain things get sprayed on

928
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:23,179
plants and when we concentrate that

929
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:26,449
thing in a hot flask under vacuum where

930
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:28,190
fires and fire attack there's a whole

931
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:30,559
bunch of ways you could do that but to

932
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:34,039
go back to Delta 10 Delta 10 is simply

933
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:40,460
an unknown type of THC that until

934
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:43,730
recently was it is yes in different in

935
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:46,280
different ways they affect all three of

936
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:49,010
those can affect a single person

937
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,570
completely different so these are kind

938
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:51,430
of

939
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:54,280
noise that have been only recently

940
00:45:51,429 --> 00:45:58,419
discovered no they've been discovered

941
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:01,180
but they're only being mass-produced yes

942
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:05,320
they yeah Mexico Manila and knows about

943
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:07,869
him and he has and we are just now mass

944
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,539
producing them because we have the

945
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:12,039
freedom of the market to start start

946
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:14,230
playing and then we also have the

947
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:16,960
competition in the market to try to make

948
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:27,880
the clearest most beautiful looking oil

949
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:31,329
which you know well it used to be Delta

950
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,010
8 th DW I mean I we can I know you I'm

951
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:33,880
saying historically historically when

952
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:36,940
they first started getting this

953
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:39,099
perfectly clear bottle of oil

954
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:44,740
it was Delta 8 and they would do this

955
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:46,389
refluxing carbon acids and but but but

956
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:48,609
yeah and that was it then they would use

957
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:51,009
a catalyst in the flask that they were

958
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:53,710
boiling in when we're talking about

959
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:55,930
people who appreciate the clerk that

960
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:58,150
clear net the c-terminus of it is that

961
00:46:55,929 --> 00:47:01,089
the consumer is that an expert consumers

962
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:02,680
okay and what's your any not consumers

963
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:06,220
have been led to believe that their

964
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:07,269
clear the oil is well and and and that

965
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:09,250
clear could come from a lot of different

966
00:47:07,269 --> 00:47:11,949
things it can be cut with another clear

967
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:15,130
oil that it makes you know just diffuses

968
00:47:11,949 --> 00:47:18,039
what color is in there there's a lot of

969
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:20,200
things that can clarity is definitely an

970
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:27,699
indicator of purity though it's an

971
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:31,869
indicator but the a slight yellow amber

972
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:34,569
tint the these are little little atomic

973
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:37,059
level refractions that are happening

974
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:39,370
with chromophores that hold into the the

975
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:42,659
tail end of the molecule these these are

976
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:47,739
what are chromophore is uncle mela

977
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:50,920
these they're they're basically like

978
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:53,379
atomically small things that will

979
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:58,000
refract light at a different color so

980
00:47:53,380 --> 00:48:01,420
you have so by breaking that bond you

981
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,429
you like that's when people distill with

982
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,050
certain things in the flask you

983
00:48:03,429 --> 00:48:10,588
can break that at that chromophore bond

984
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:13,410
and it you can also break that bond by

985
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:16,328
through chromatography as well which

986
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:18,190
people eventually developed a method for

987
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:22,380
Delta 9 THC

988
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:25,300
does anyone clear water clear yeah and

989
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:27,608
that was just a method of taking a

990
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:31,839
single pass distillate and then passing

991
00:48:27,608 --> 00:48:36,029
it through a series of usually magnesium

992
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:39,659
silicate or floor so actually and then

993
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:43,050
but different color remediating

994
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:46,149
absorbance that were also being used to

995
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:48,670
remediated pesticides and they still are

996
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:53,619
used to remediate pesticides and it just

997
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:56,349
happened that you make water clear

998
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:58,809
delta-9 after remediating pesticides

999
00:48:56,349 --> 00:49:01,119
properly as sometimes depending on the

1000
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:13,019
oil and what kind of colors and that and

1001
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:16,030
yeah the condition and they're they're

1002
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:19,239
they're prevalent in the same way that

1003
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:20,769
THC is in canada like there is it kind

1004
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:22,779
of like a is it a totally different

1005
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:27,130
cannabinoid that is in very low

1006
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,950
percentages in bars not so much on the

1007
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:31,088
cultivar it's a reaction through

1008
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:32,649
processing so you're not gonna have

1009
00:49:31,088 --> 00:49:36,250
those you're not gonna have a bunch of

1010
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:38,108
delta 8 or delta 10 any in your flowers

1011
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:47,588
you're gonna have it in it kind of a

1012
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:57,578
crazy they're isomers correct and it was

1013
00:49:47,588 --> 00:50:02,889
the one thing that's what you're

1014
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:05,859
capturing well if you because you're

1015
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:07,568
right it's it's these little slices but

1016
00:50:05,858 --> 00:50:10,480
the only way that's possible is that

1017
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:13,420
we've now created these massive machine

1018
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:17,380
that will process a lot so we get bigger

1019
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:19,990
trends you know we we see information

1020
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:22,450
come out of plant material from farms

1021
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:24,099
all over California grown differently

1022
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:26,679
going different ways different yields

1023
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:28,480
different strengths different compounds

1024
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:30,730
or the makeup of the cannabinoids in

1025
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,230
that specific strain like it's really

1026
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:34,780
interesting we get to see a lot of those

1027
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,460
so at the same time as we're narrowing

1028
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:38,920
the focus and really like getting to

1029
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,840
chop down into you know now we're we

1030
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,650
just picked up a machine that will

1031
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:47,130
separate out individual cannabinoids so

1032
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:49,960
you can collect them individually

1033
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:54,010
it's a centrifugal partitioning

1034
00:50:49,960 --> 00:51:09,490
chromatography this company called roto

1035
00:50:54,010 --> 00:51:12,280
Kron THC and ten are kind of like mine

1036
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:13,779
like other cannabinoids that we've known

1037
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,570
about it but haven't been able to

1038
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:20,470
isolate so on the market are we gonna

1039
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:23,050
eventually see like THC eight tinctures

1040
00:51:20,469 --> 00:51:24,099
and THC ten tinctures in the same way

1041
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,970
that we see other kind of minor

1042
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:27,869
cannabinoid

1043
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:31,109
totally and we've been seeing mostly

1044
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:35,380
we've been seeing a lot of THC eight

1045
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:37,690
cart hay in cartridges and there is the

1046
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:45,130
subsequent subsequently a decent amount

1047
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:46,990
of delta 10 THC that's in there well no

1048
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,550
they're just calling it it if you're

1049
00:51:46,989 --> 00:51:50,619
buying a card off the traditional market

1050
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:51,940
you they're saying it's one thing but

1051
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:54,369
who knows what really is in that

1052
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:58,659
cartridge right so but because you can

1053
00:51:54,369 --> 00:51:59,949
take garbage oil and by attorney by

1054
00:51:58,659 --> 00:52:01,869
doing this process to convert it to

1055
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:04,509
Delta eight clean it up to make it look

1056
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:06,880
clear a lot of guys do that cuz I can

1057
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:08,560
buy a really cheap oil get a little bit

1058
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:12,010
of a fraction of that off and this

1059
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:14,139
really nice-looking oil and then it's

1060
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:17,920
just cheaper the way that it's produced

1061
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:20,679
then I like water clear Delta nine it

1062
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,139
takes extremely expensive absorbance and

1063
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:27,339
a process to do it with the Delta eight

1064
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:28,449
you throw some activated carbon in their

1065
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,550
flask

1066
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:33,549
if you distill right your you can get

1067
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:36,940
water clear I mean there's a few other a

1068
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:38,260
few other parameters to change but you

1069
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,119
just dump a bunch of garbage in your

1070
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,790
flask and then just mix it with your oil

1071
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:44,980
and your oil is coming out nicely that

1072
00:52:42,789 --> 00:52:48,009
was what a bunch of people were doing to

1073
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:50,108
fix their dark oil especially in the

1074
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:59,230
early days when people really weren't

1075
00:52:50,108 --> 00:53:04,000
distilling very well their ads and

1076
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:06,030
humbled for a I guess an extraction

1077
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,710
company that will take your moldy flat

1078
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:15,550
and so can you guys talk about like

1079
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:20,409
while you may be able to clean moldy

1080
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:24,760
flour is that I mean a lot of people I

1081
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:28,118
mean moldy flour is like that's unless

1082
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:32,260
the it depends on the mold and usually

1083
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:35,800
it's gonna be botrytis or piano that

1084
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:38,230
powdery mildew if it's something and

1085
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:41,530
those don't leave behind any aflatoxins

1086
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:43,269
they're gonna em so if it was something

1087
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:45,609
like Aspergillus which is more of a

1088
00:53:43,269 --> 00:53:48,539
grain mold then that leaves behind

1089
00:53:45,608 --> 00:53:52,059
things like that can go into solution

1090
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:54,219
molds those molds can all be filter

1091
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:56,828
filtered out I had a point two micron

1092
00:53:54,219 --> 00:53:59,500
range and with proper distillation

1093
00:53:56,829 --> 00:54:01,630
methods they they won't they don't come

1094
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:04,960
out but they they actually are usually

1095
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:07,300
undetectable by by the time our oil is

1096
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,818
crude not even before it's going through

1097
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:13,470
most of the extra processing methods and

1098
00:54:09,818 --> 00:54:15,818
it still cannabinoids coming out its

1099
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:19,199
long story short there are people that

1100
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:22,719
that do do that kind of stuff we do it

1101
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:27,460
but we thoroughly test our end products

1102
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:29,019
just as a an education point because I

1103
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:31,900
think when your average person here is

1104
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:33,699
like someone's taking a moldy flour and

1105
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,220
turning to concentrate you got if

1106
00:54:33,699 --> 00:54:36,929
someone made an amazing product like a

1107
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:39,449
constant

1108
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:41,190
what started as moldy flower either you

1109
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:45,960
would have any problem smoking that well

1110
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:48,059
do you think about the when you get a

1111
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,949
hard cider do you think about a nice

1112
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:53,820
apple or do you think about that rotten

1113
00:54:49,949 --> 00:54:57,559
apple that's fermenting I mean the end

1114
00:54:53,820 --> 00:55:02,850
product is actually the the rotten apple

1115
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:05,039
we're pulling the actual non-biological

1116
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:08,039
compounds out of it completely

1117
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:10,259
separating it from the biomass so any of

1118
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:12,360
the but we leave behind all the

1119
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:15,660
biological compounds that all the DNA is

1120
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:17,990
left back behind with biomass and that's

1121
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:23,219
what our process does is to separate

1122
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:26,759
target oils from biological compounds so

1123
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:28,949
yes I would I I do smoke our product I

1124
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:32,130
do smoke it if it if there is similarly

1125
00:55:28,949 --> 00:55:34,739
you know I guess I I smoke it yeah every

1126
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:36,510
day yeah that idea you know going back

1127
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:39,149
to where we started as we got into this

1128
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:41,340
small farm kind of mentality and how can

1129
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:43,349
we support this and make this turn this

1130
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:46,950
into a business and that was one of the

1131
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:49,589
things like we've actually got to you

1132
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:51,299
know save a couple farms by them sending

1133
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:53,460
us all their molding material and like

1134
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,930
we extracting all the good stuff out of

1135
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,929
it leaving behind all the all their

1136
00:55:54,929 --> 00:56:02,039
garbage and refining it and testing and

1137
00:55:57,929 --> 00:56:04,500
make sure it's you know okay to sell to

1138
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:05,940
a consumer market and and then we sell

1139
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,619
it knowing that we did like a really

1140
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:11,070
good job and then that money goes back

1141
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:12,509
to that farmer and it's cool that's

1142
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,980
really cool and they live for another

1143
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:16,170
season for it yeah

1144
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,030
which is you know and then the day all

1145
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:21,000
you can hope for right now just get to

1146
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:23,670
the next one when you were first growing

1147
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,340
in Michigan and you were first growing

1148
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:32,490
up in Humble what were the genetics that

1149
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:34,800
you came into that we were just like I

1150
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:35,419
I'm from I'm from Michigan so yours is

1151
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,000
gonna

1152
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:43,818
like mine are gonna be wacky it names

1153
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,079
the mines Williams wonder I was that was

1154
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:50,269
my baby

1155
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:57,440
I loved Williams wonder and well it

1156
00:56:50,269 --> 00:57:00,530
wasn't like just you know just a big fat

1157
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,900
I don't know how true it is I was told

1158
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:05,960
that Williams wonders like in an indoor

1159
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:08,088
only strangers it has to be has to be

1160
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,588
flatter under 12 12 and 12 and it won't

1161
00:57:08,088 --> 00:57:12,078
it won't start

1162
00:57:09,588 --> 00:57:13,818
outdoor fast enough and I mean I was in

1163
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:19,760
Michigan it didn't matter but it was

1164
00:57:13,818 --> 00:57:23,630
like a super strong Lysol and just I it

1165
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:27,170
was the but there was the it wasn't

1166
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:30,289
leafy you had really big leaves and then

1167
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:31,608
one day you'd walk in and all of your

1168
00:57:30,289 --> 00:57:33,139
plants would be hanging over because

1169
00:57:31,608 --> 00:57:35,179
they would just plump up at the same

1170
00:57:33,139 --> 00:57:38,838
time then you start have to like it was

1171
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:39,889
just really fast really quick and like

1172
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:45,529
low maintenance

1173
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:47,889
I did that with super Silver Haze as

1174
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:49,460
just a good strong thing that was gonna

1175
00:57:47,889 --> 00:57:51,949
reduce mol

1176
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:54,980
deal with mold because I was you know a

1177
00:57:51,949 --> 00:58:00,108
new grower and get something to be mold

1178
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:03,048
resistant I think for years I grew just

1179
00:58:00,108 --> 00:58:05,239
a few strains Platinum Girl Scout

1180
00:58:03,048 --> 00:58:09,619
cookies which was platinum OG a Girl

1181
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:13,308
Scout cross that was bonkers just just

1182
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:14,960
the most fire just well everybody was

1183
00:58:13,309 --> 00:58:16,369
just beautiful like and it was always

1184
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,108
dense you get when you grew that

1185
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:19,608
straight is like dropping little rocks

1186
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:22,068
in your in your bucket when you're

1187
00:58:19,608 --> 00:58:23,869
trimming you know don't like I can't

1188
00:58:22,068 --> 00:58:26,509
just pop or like you know the oh geez

1189
00:58:23,869 --> 00:58:28,608
and stuff are a little bit lighter and

1190
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:36,200
so I grew that Platinum cookie strain I

1191
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:44,098
grew Tahoe OG I cut a Tahoe G Louie the

1192
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:46,558
13th and OG 18 that's how we met yeah

1193
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:49,048
oh yeah those are my three strains the

1194
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:54,449
Tahoe Louie and and cookies which were

1195
00:58:49,048 --> 00:58:56,969
like you know I grew things that I knew

1196
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:59,369
people like and I and I like myself and

1197
00:58:56,969 --> 00:59:05,579
those trains were all fucker like yep

1198
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:07,739
you know pretty happy in because you had

1199
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:11,400
a lot of hype I mean right I mean I I

1200
00:59:07,739 --> 00:59:14,719
think I really love Louie Intellivision

1201
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:18,749
still two of my favorite strains the the

1202
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:21,389
limonene in Tahoe was like so pronounced

1203
00:59:18,748 --> 00:59:22,858
like you just smell this like citrus

1204
00:59:21,389 --> 00:59:25,048
coming off that plant and like with that

1205
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:28,739
fuel underneath those and they grew so

1206
00:59:25,048 --> 00:59:30,958
they grew perfectly warm cool and chunky

1207
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:34,259
yeah and then the Louise had that

1208
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:36,028
awesome crown and crown of yeah they

1209
00:59:34,259 --> 00:59:37,170
were really cool they purple out and

1210
00:59:36,028 --> 00:59:39,449
then really at that whole greenhouse

1211
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:41,190
purple doubt well that was the girl of

1212
00:59:39,449 --> 00:59:44,130
the Platinum girl scale they would to

1213
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:45,630
like yeah the Platinum would just you

1214
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:47,969
know get a little cold at night and they

1215
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:49,680
were just cope just turn into these you

1216
00:59:47,969 --> 00:59:51,479
think we're like shiny I believe like

1217
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:56,190
the density of a baseball though yeah

1218
00:59:51,478 --> 01:00:05,879
man I'm going to transition to the joys

1219
00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:10,409
of regulation what what's one regulation

1220
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:12,559
that affects us manufacturer the drives

1221
01:00:10,409 --> 01:00:15,629
you crazy

1222
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:19,109
no smoking within 50 feet of the

1223
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:23,130
building smoking marijuana on premises

1224
01:00:19,108 --> 01:00:26,489
yeah this the the shock of culture like

1225
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:28,739
we yeah we we're old-school guys like we

1226
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:30,838
like to work around our plants and smoke

1227
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:32,579
them and so I don't know is that the one

1228
01:00:30,838 --> 01:00:34,108
that but I'm sure that you've got some

1229
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:36,420
other stuff that's true you have you

1230
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:39,900
struggled I have a really odd odd take

1231
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:41,818
on on the regulations yeah I'm not gonna

1232
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,400
like have an opinion about the taxes and

1233
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:45,750
all that they're you know debilitating

1234
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,650
and

1235
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:51,269
but a lot of the other right regulations

1236
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:54,480
specifically for manufacturing you know

1237
01:00:51,269 --> 01:00:58,679
that kind of circle around safety and

1238
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:00,329
compliance and you know like I wanted to

1239
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:02,369
get better at this so I get people

1240
01:01:00,329 --> 01:01:05,309
better product at the end of the day and

1241
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:08,069
so like if if someone's pushing that

1242
01:01:05,309 --> 01:01:09,539
into the industry and like saying no if

1243
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:11,220
it's going I mean we have like this some

1244
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:14,670
of the toughest laws on pesticide

1245
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:17,449
content yeah in the US we have but

1246
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:19,349
beyond what the FDA would even say

1247
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:23,039
there's some things that have happened

1248
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:25,769
that do make some barriers to get into

1249
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:28,440
it because you gotta try a lot harder to

1250
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:30,960
get good product but they're super

1251
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:33,030
important for like making the industry

1252
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,610
real and like making consumers have you

1253
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:38,280
know a good feeling about what the

1254
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:40,860
people that are in the marketplace are

1255
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:42,750
are bringing to the table and just like

1256
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:44,430
anything else out there like all the

1257
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:48,739
garbage food that's in the grocery store

1258
01:01:44,429 --> 01:01:54,329
all these different things like there's

1259
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:56,579
you know sometimes regulations don't get

1260
01:01:54,329 --> 01:01:59,009
followed and people try to you know cut

1261
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:01,230
corners and skirt them but like I think

1262
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:03,570
that that spirit of like trying to get

1263
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:06,389
better and having regulations in that

1264
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:08,760
sense push you towards that goal line of

1265
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:12,659
like offering the absolute best product

1266
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:15,360
you can I'm cool with it everything else

1267
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:16,710
past that you know taxation and like the

1268
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,079
way they've rolled this out everything

1269
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:21,300
like obviously I'm I'm in it so I have

1270
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:23,009
issues like everybody else but I think a

1271
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:25,530
lot some of that's overlooked is that is

1272
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:27,990
that other work how do you guys I think

1273
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:30,120
of LA and I think of per square foot

1274
01:02:27,989 --> 01:02:32,779
price you how'd you guys decided to set

1275
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:35,460
up a manufacturing facility in LA versus

1276
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:39,090
45 minutes north of LA where it's

1277
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:41,789
probably much cheaper so a lot of things

1278
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:46,130
happen we we met this guy about four

1279
01:02:41,789 --> 01:02:51,360
years ago his name was use owed

1280
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:55,050
nishihara so

1281
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:59,180
yeah a big dude he worked at that time

1282
01:02:55,050 --> 01:03:02,310
for one of the largest manufacturers of

1283
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:04,859
flavored hookah tobacco did a hue they

1284
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:05,549
just released this like huge 220,000

1285
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:08,269
square foot

1286
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:12,350
you know facility and then like you know

1287
01:03:08,269 --> 01:03:15,509
FDA came out like no no flavored tobacco

1288
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:16,650
you're done and like that whole market

1289
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:18,180
just went and then they came out with

1290
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:20,849
pods and now they're all from their

1291
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:30,029
fighting pods over over targeting you

1292
01:03:20,849 --> 01:03:31,769
know jewel pod jewel pod packs so that

1293
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:33,720
but that's the FDA's got that coming

1294
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:35,699
down in two years anyway so like de

1295
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:36,629
charm clove cigarettes you know all

1296
01:03:35,699 --> 01:03:38,039
these different things they're like

1297
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:41,490
those things are all done within two

1298
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:44,009
years you won't see any flavored I think

1299
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:50,909
they kept menthol yeah there be like

1300
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:53,520
riots if like yeah right like exactly

1301
01:03:50,909 --> 01:03:55,819
how these Southern Belles like just

1302
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:59,820
pissed off that's not good for anybody

1303
01:03:55,820 --> 01:04:02,480
but yeah the so all that regulation

1304
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,480
where was I going with this

1305
01:04:02,929 --> 01:04:10,440
yeah oh so we met this dude he was bar

1306
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:14,460
to this big company

1307
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:16,920
he brought us down here on this kind of

1308
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:18,630
like pre cunt and and we were so that

1309
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,030
year we were on a hundred and sixty acre

1310
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:24,480
farm him and I were running the farm and

1311
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:26,640
we had Mendocino outside of Ukiah not

1312
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:31,559
too far from Johnny stashes place

1313
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:33,900
actually and so for a year we built ran

1314
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:36,029
this farm it was supposed to be like

1315
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:39,240
five guys it ended up being me and Noah

1316
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:46,710
the entire year like the partner we had

1317
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:49,459
was like how stuff things happening not

1318
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:51,869
not good things happening with him and

1319
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:53,159
it was really uncomfortable for at the

1320
01:04:51,869 --> 01:04:57,119
last six months but we just like stuck

1321
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:59,789
it out there and we said okay where to

1322
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:03,089
next and and I'd been feeling for a year

1323
01:04:59,789 --> 01:05:03,800
so like we did this trial run me and

1324
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:05,960
Noah partnered

1325
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:11,960
on this project built our own for our

1326
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:14,000
first closed-loop system and a car was

1327
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:16,699
designed that he did in a carport in the

1328
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:23,570
middle of nowhere in Mendocino and I

1329
01:05:16,699 --> 01:05:25,639
mean slightly gray wolves design and so

1330
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:26,960
I was like if I think this is where this

1331
01:05:25,639 --> 01:05:29,989
industry is going to be the most

1332
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:31,250
interesting I think most I don't think

1333
01:05:29,989 --> 01:05:32,989
soccer moms gonna be sitting in their

1334
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:34,610
car rolling up doobies you know in their

1335
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:35,899
minivan I think they're gonna have a

1336
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:37,220
little vape pen or they're gonna have a

1337
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:39,340
little topical or they're gonna take a

1338
01:05:37,219 --> 01:05:42,529
little pill like everybody else does

1339
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:54,470
that's not a weed head kind of kind of

1340
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:56,870
person and I was like yeah I roll I roll

1341
01:05:54,469 --> 01:05:59,149
joints a lot yeah I me and my wife like

1342
01:05:56,869 --> 01:06:03,529
probably smoked a part of a J every

1343
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:04,940
night if I'm like I have kids so I don't

1344
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:07,220
smoke too like eight o'clock at night so

1345
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:09,110
because I don't smoke all day like I

1346
01:06:07,219 --> 01:06:10,669
take couple puffs I'm like ready to go

1347
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:12,710
to bed

1348
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:15,409
in years past my favorite way it was

1349
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:16,639
spliffs so a little too back on hash or

1350
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:20,179
a little bit of tobacco constant

1351
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:23,019
sunflower I went through a pretty long

1352
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:25,129
period of just like chewing through

1353
01:06:23,019 --> 01:06:28,599
concentrates because we were making so

1354
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:30,410
much we're smoking yeah we're doing

1355
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:31,969
specifically we're this like rush

1356
01:06:30,409 --> 01:06:33,589
Labor's oh and then we were doing

1357
01:06:31,969 --> 01:06:36,109
contract manufacturing so people would

1358
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:37,400
bring like a thousand we had thousand

1359
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:38,840
different strains come through there

1360
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:45,079
that were doing these small batch like

1361
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:47,180
sauce it was most that it was all dabs

1362
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:49,969
that it tastes really like crazy for

1363
01:06:47,179 --> 01:06:52,608
sure like lemon

1364
01:06:49,969 --> 01:06:54,199
and just don't Kansas yeah became like

1365
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:56,799
Oh what does this taste like what does

1366
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:59,809
this taste like yeah which is no good

1367
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,490
yeah I would say now I just I'll smoke a

1368
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:04,539
little bit of a joint I really even hit

1369
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:04,539
Bacon's that much anymore

1370
01:07:04,608 --> 01:07:11,659
don't do the splits at all at very very

1371
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:14,650
occasionally like usually when I'm

1372
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:22,089
stoned during the day I'll smoke that's

1373
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:27,139
that's my primary intake intake I think

1374
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:29,950
I have a CBD heavy tincture and a THC

1375
01:07:27,139 --> 01:07:35,440
the CBD is actually like a full spectrum

1376
01:07:29,949 --> 01:07:38,899
from hemp and the THC is like a

1377
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,619
two-to-one ratio of THC distillate to

1378
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:44,750
mgt

1379
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:47,358
so I I take those every night and then

1380
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:49,219
I'll take a few drops for the CBD if you

1381
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:57,940
drop registers of the CBD throughout the

1382
01:07:49,219 --> 01:08:01,009
day but the CBD just keeps anxiety

1383
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:05,240
anxiety and I've lower back pain as well

1384
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:09,050
but mostly anxiety down THC helps me

1385
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:12,049
sleep I'm usually so excited about how

1386
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:15,370
things went on with the workday I like I

1387
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:18,199
love my factory and when I leave it I

1388
01:08:15,369 --> 01:08:19,909
I'm just thinking about the next thing

1389
01:08:18,199 --> 01:08:24,289
that I'm gonna build there and like I

1390
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:26,869
it's hard to sleep I take a little as

1391
01:08:24,289 --> 01:08:29,479
I'm leaving work I take about a thousand

1392
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:32,028
milligrams of THC and then by the time

1393
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:34,519
I'm eating my dinner and everything it's

1394
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:38,270
starting to kick in and letting me start

1395
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:49,630
to slow down a little bit so I can wake

1396
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:52,730
up and do it again that I mean like in

1397
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:53,489
three four got three white a white film

1398
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:56,788
evaporator

1399
01:08:53,488 --> 01:08:59,488
that I'm installing one massive 0.5 and

1400
01:08:56,788 --> 01:09:03,420
then 2.2 meters squared

1401
01:08:59,488 --> 01:09:07,048
wiped films I've got the surface area of

1402
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:10,998
the of the cylinders is measured in

1403
01:09:07,048 --> 01:09:16,009
meters squared and 0.5 is like a massive

1404
01:09:10,998 --> 01:09:18,689
surface area to evaporate off of and

1405
01:09:16,009 --> 01:09:20,939
we're installing a falling film

1406
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:23,518
evaporator busy be following film

1407
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:28,348
evaporator hopefully this week when we

1408
01:09:23,519 --> 01:09:31,679
get in the last of the parts and firing

1409
01:09:28,349 --> 01:09:37,078
up the centrifugal partitioning

1410
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:40,230
chromatography system we also have I've

1411
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:43,920
got my chemists working on THC

1412
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:48,838
remediation from CVD material and then

1413
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:50,998
we're also working on converting CBD you

1414
01:09:48,838 --> 01:09:57,630
have to take it out of CBD oil to keep

1415
01:09:50,998 --> 01:10:05,340
it to keep it full spectrum to be able

1416
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:10,139
to yes and then also converting CBD to

1417
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:12,690
THC we're developing stages SOPs around

1418
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:20,190
that and then trying to build equipment

1419
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:26,759
to do that it's not commonly and people

1420
01:10:20,189 --> 01:10:28,558
do do it and it can be done yeah and I

1421
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:32,219
think that's a big future of where

1422
01:10:28,559 --> 01:10:35,880
that's so lightly like a like maybe for

1423
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:38,248
people currently are doing anything that

1424
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:40,949
it's on such a small scale and it

1425
01:10:38,248 --> 01:10:43,260
doesn't actually work correctly so

1426
01:10:40,948 --> 01:10:45,569
you'll get like half isomers from half

1427
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:48,300
your oil will be like that converted oil

1428
01:10:45,569 --> 01:10:50,998
some of it will be some in Frankenstein

1429
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:54,599
a lot of it doesn't see molecules a lot

1430
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:58,248
of its delta x and some delta 8 so doing

1431
01:10:54,599 --> 01:11:00,960
it correctly to where you get a

1432
01:10:58,248 --> 01:11:04,889
conversion from say Kinesis Delta 9 THC

1433
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:07,408
is like is a consistent conversion to at

1434
01:11:04,889 --> 01:11:10,400
a very specific yield meaning like the

1435
01:11:07,408 --> 01:11:14,998
amount of material that gets converted

1436
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:17,129
is like changing and so many different

1437
01:11:14,998 --> 01:11:19,439
like it's the industry shaking

1438
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:21,179
revolutionized everything so you think

1439
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:22,828
about those like tens of hundreds of

1440
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:24,359
thousands of acres in Colombia and Chile

1441
01:11:22,828 --> 01:11:29,448
that grow ahead and imagine the

1442
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:32,719
implications it makes for when when

1443
01:11:29,448 --> 01:11:36,178
places actually start legalizing THC

1444
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:40,859
like it takes how many how long do grow

1445
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:42,929
plant and then get to really relevant

1446
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:47,268
because you can't grow a hemp farm and

1447
01:11:42,929 --> 01:11:47,269
then process and then convert it to

1448
01:11:49,248 --> 01:11:57,658
future weight not the future right now

1449
01:11:52,319 --> 01:12:00,210
the USDA just opined on that anything

1450
01:11:57,658 --> 01:12:03,029
any compound because of the farm bill

1451
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:04,948
derive for my hemp plant is a legal

1452
01:12:03,029 --> 01:12:07,828
compound and because of the language in

1453
01:12:04,948 --> 01:12:10,649
the in the farm bill there needs no

1454
01:12:07,828 --> 01:12:12,359
other congressional approval like THC

1455
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:24,719
from hemp and CBD from hemp are

1456
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:26,908
perfectly legal compounds so that looks

1457
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:29,130
like and I think if like the Senate

1458
01:12:26,908 --> 01:12:31,348
Majority Leader like Connell who's been

1459
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:32,670
pushing him for a long time that is the

1460
01:12:31,349 --> 01:12:35,010
backdoor to legalization

1461
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:38,279
that's why cannabis probably isn't legal

1462
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:38,909
on a federal level he's a crafty old

1463
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:41,038
geezer

1464
01:12:38,908 --> 01:12:43,078
he's like the guy in every single

1465
01:12:41,038 --> 01:12:46,828
scooby-doo show you know and he's like

1466
01:12:43,078 --> 01:12:47,609
oh well you've got me this time yeah

1467
01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:52,170
exactly

1468
01:12:47,609 --> 01:12:55,130
you dimed kids so if I understand

1469
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:58,889
correctly you guys see a future where

1470
01:12:55,130 --> 01:13:03,059
the massive massive amounts of hemp

1471
01:12:58,889 --> 01:13:06,748
feels being grown can be converted to

1472
01:13:03,059 --> 01:13:08,920
THC which could end up in my vape

1473
01:13:06,748 --> 01:13:11,948
cartridge yeah and

1474
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:15,579
actually people are now starting to grow

1475
01:13:11,948 --> 01:13:19,029
hemp for terpene profiles if you if

1476
01:13:15,579 --> 01:13:21,130
people are worried about flavors and you

1477
01:13:19,029 --> 01:13:23,469
know and can have an odd profiles

1478
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:26,550
well flavor profiles can all be done

1479
01:13:23,469 --> 01:13:28,869
through breeding well you can eventually

1480
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:32,679
isolate those and then you can isolate

1481
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:34,840
the terpenes and then from there you

1482
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:37,800
grow different cultivars for different

1483
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:40,539
cannabinoids and then we start to

1484
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:44,579
isolate these cannabinoids and then we

1485
01:13:40,539 --> 01:13:47,859
can form them into a concentrate that is

1486
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:50,649
tailored with the right concentration

1487
01:13:47,859 --> 01:14:01,630
for cannabinoids with the flavor profile

1488
01:13:50,649 --> 01:14:03,219
that that's all natural it actually

1489
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:05,289
doesn't mean anything all-natural yeah

1490
01:14:03,219 --> 01:14:07,390
it really means really no there's really

1491
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:14,590
no definition to all-natural you can

1492
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:20,170
it's yeah it's a market ideally I say

1493
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:22,900
anything I mean what cannabis is well I

1494
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:26,500
was I mean I was just saying all-natural

1495
01:14:22,899 --> 01:14:28,539
as like it was a really stupid thing for

1496
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:31,770
me to say I didn't mean all that I met I

1497
01:14:28,539 --> 01:14:36,189
met cannabis derived or have derived so

1498
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:38,230
yeah as terpenes coming from the plants

1499
01:14:36,189 --> 01:14:39,789
that's the word it's plant derived like

1500
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:42,488
if you're not using cannabis terpenes I

1501
01:14:39,789 --> 01:14:44,109
think you take plant derived terpenes

1502
01:14:42,488 --> 01:14:48,069
and if they're not plant drive terpenes

1503
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:49,000
there are oil based synthetic well no no

1504
01:14:48,069 --> 01:14:51,549
I know

1505
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,310
plant derived terpenes is what people

1506
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:56,829
say about non cannabis it's it's either

1507
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:58,420
cannabis derive terpenes or its plant

1508
01:14:56,829 --> 01:15:00,399
derived terpenes it's just a way that

1509
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:02,409
people skirt though the ground a lot of

1510
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:03,819
different plants yes exactly so they

1511
01:15:02,409 --> 01:15:05,889
skirt around that and people say that

1512
01:15:03,819 --> 01:15:07,869
all the time so it's all the terpenes

1513
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:09,489
out there are plant derived like that

1514
01:15:07,869 --> 01:15:12,729
you know and they're actually molecular

1515
01:15:09,488 --> 01:15:15,218
the same but that's the profiles like

1516
01:15:12,729 --> 01:15:17,019
the real thing is that it's terpene

1517
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:19,149
profiles that are important these and

1518
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:21,160
profiles on a cannabis are way way way

1519
01:15:19,149 --> 01:15:21,719
way more complex than five terpenes

1520
01:15:21,159 --> 01:15:24,748
they're like

1521
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:27,538
and also there's then you're not taking

1522
01:15:24,748 --> 01:15:29,010
the there's flavonoids and esters that

1523
01:15:27,538 --> 01:15:31,710
don't come over and I've steam

1524
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:35,248
distillation like flavonoids kind of get

1525
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:39,269
the short stick talk about Madi noids

1526
01:15:35,248 --> 01:15:43,309
terpenes so give a plug to flavonoids

1527
01:15:39,269 --> 01:15:48,630
why do we care about flavonoids um they

1528
01:15:43,309 --> 01:15:52,380
they're I'm not completely versed on

1529
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:57,479
their medical benefits but they are

1530
01:15:52,380 --> 01:16:02,269
heavier molecules that add flavor to the

1531
01:15:57,479 --> 01:16:02,269
profile of cannabis but because their

1532
01:16:05,538 --> 01:16:11,550
olfactory terpenes deals specifically

1533
01:16:09,748 --> 01:16:16,439
with your olfactory senses where

1534
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:21,510
flavonoids deal with your tongue and

1535
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:25,018
your taste yes and the molecule is way

1536
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:28,130
heavier on the flavonoids so it's it it

1537
01:16:25,019 --> 01:16:31,019
does not get distilled out

1538
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:32,460
yeah it's it's not part of the distilled

1539
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:34,710
terpenes it's not part of a terpene

1540
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:36,960
blend same thing with the esters as well

1541
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:39,389
and these are things that that blend to

1542
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:42,118
the entire smell profile we call it a

1543
01:16:39,389 --> 01:16:45,840
terpene profile but it's a it's a smell

1544
01:16:42,118 --> 01:16:51,299
or it's an experience profile yes

1545
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:53,819
yeah and that's errs yes and well we

1546
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:55,079
don't know what happens when you what

1547
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:58,139
kind of reactions happen when you

1548
01:16:55,078 --> 01:17:06,268
combust all those different 180

1549
01:16:58,139 --> 01:17:08,699
different compounds I know but yeah on a

1550
01:17:06,269 --> 01:17:11,039
medical level like there's you know I

1551
01:17:08,698 --> 01:17:13,339
don't circling this way back this

1552
01:17:11,038 --> 01:17:16,439
conference that we're doing is like

1553
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:18,210
focused exactly on that there's a lot of

1554
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:23,129
fiction out there a lot of people have a

1555
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:25,618
lot of really good ideas about what

1556
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:28,319
cannabinoids do what different compounds

1557
01:17:25,618 --> 01:17:30,179
what you know full-spectrum single eye

1558
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:31,518
slits you know a lot of people have some

1559
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:35,378
good ideas

1560
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:38,748
but there is not enough science that are

1561
01:17:35,378 --> 01:17:41,418
you know propping up these ideas or

1562
01:17:38,748 --> 01:17:43,158
smashing them to pieces and so like that

1563
01:17:41,418 --> 01:17:45,769
the conference we're doing is is really

1564
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:49,658
focused on people who are actually doing

1565
01:17:45,769 --> 01:17:51,918
that research and finding some answers

1566
01:17:49,658 --> 01:17:53,358
can come out and you know talking

1567
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:55,099
bringing it to the attention of the

1568
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:59,239
people that are making the oil and and

1569
01:17:55,099 --> 01:18:04,788
you know this in the gray black and

1570
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:07,248
newly white market and it's like there's

1571
01:18:04,788 --> 01:18:08,958
a disconnection between the cutting-edge

1572
01:18:07,248 --> 01:18:10,849
research and the people that are making

1573
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:12,648
the medicine and once you start

1574
01:18:10,849 --> 01:18:15,019
connecting those people that is like I

1575
01:18:12,649 --> 01:18:17,869
think that there's a lot of great things

1576
01:18:15,019 --> 01:18:19,939
can happen you go back to like you know

1577
01:18:17,868 --> 01:18:23,568
you want to make the best product like

1578
01:18:19,939 --> 01:18:26,449
find out what's in what delivery method

1579
01:18:23,569 --> 01:18:29,209
is best for you know the doctors are

1580
01:18:26,448 --> 01:18:31,728
doing research on that cannabinoid or

1581
01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:34,309
that group of cannabinoids you know how

1582
01:18:31,729 --> 01:18:37,189
that goes intersectional your stomach

1583
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:39,529
your lungs your but we've got a long way

1584
01:18:37,189 --> 01:18:42,229
to go in research and like connecting

1585
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:44,719
the people that actually are passionate

1586
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:46,519
about about it on the the site of making

1587
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,078
the medicine is really important with

1588
01:18:46,519 --> 01:18:59,149
the people that are actually researching

1589
01:18:48,078 --> 01:19:05,469
and and providing that medicine and then

1590
01:18:59,149 --> 01:19:08,628
give me one patent that concerns you

1591
01:19:05,469 --> 01:19:10,429
it's a I wish I had been prepared for

1592
01:19:08,628 --> 01:19:12,198
that you want to go first I'll do the

1593
01:19:10,429 --> 01:19:16,878
medical one and you can do the patent on

1594
01:19:12,198 --> 01:19:20,858
it okay well the the medical one I

1595
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:25,719
there's a sky UCLA and he's part of the

1596
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:28,909
him and his research partners Eva Cooper

1597
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:31,760
Jeff chin yeah yeah so Jeff Chanin's Eva

1598
01:19:28,908 --> 01:19:34,818
I watched a talk with him the other day

1599
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:37,519
and he did it was a small you know takes

1600
01:19:34,819 --> 01:19:39,349
money to donate to the UCLA cannabis

1601
01:19:37,519 --> 01:19:42,079
Research Fund it's a great great place

1602
01:19:39,349 --> 01:19:44,519
to put some of that weed money don't

1603
01:19:42,078 --> 01:19:50,038
give them cash they won't

1604
01:19:44,519 --> 01:19:55,159
but they create pretext I don't know

1605
01:19:50,038 --> 01:19:55,158
actually that's a good question yeah

1606
01:19:55,788 --> 01:20:02,668
yeah so they they did a small study

1607
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:04,408
where they gave someone five and I'm

1608
01:20:02,668 --> 01:20:06,358
gonna get the dosing off because I

1609
01:20:04,408 --> 01:20:09,898
didn't memorize it but it was like five

1610
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:12,389
milligrams of oxycodone by itself and

1611
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:16,800
they would measure from normal how much

1612
01:20:12,389 --> 01:20:19,050
pain or the analgesic effect of that

1613
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,389
five milligrams on them five milligrams

1614
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:23,399
of oxycodone really didn't do hardly

1615
01:20:21,389 --> 01:20:25,199
anything right there was no noticeable

1616
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:30,019
change in there and their being able to

1617
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:35,038
withstand pain then they gave them a

1618
01:20:30,019 --> 01:20:38,458
five milligram dose of THC and there was

1619
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:41,819
a 20% increase in analgesic effect and

1620
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:44,819
they can withstand 20% more pain then

1621
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:47,368
they gave them five milligrams of

1622
01:20:44,819 --> 01:20:53,788
oxycodone and five milligrams of THC

1623
01:20:47,368 --> 01:20:56,938
together and it had an 80% increase in

1624
01:20:53,788 --> 01:20:59,429
pain management and at that low doses of

1625
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:02,010
oxycodone like the kind of addiction

1626
01:20:59,429 --> 01:21:07,199
worries go away it doesn't but there's a

1627
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:09,349
catalytic effect between the THC and the

1628
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:13,198
oxycodone working together to give a

1629
01:21:09,349 --> 01:21:15,929
enormous boost in analgesic effect and

1630
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:18,868
like we are sitting on top of the

1631
01:21:15,929 --> 01:21:22,649
biggest like heroin crisis for opioid

1632
01:21:18,868 --> 01:21:25,708
crisis whatever I call it ever and and

1633
01:21:22,649 --> 01:21:28,769
and most most of those addictions start

1634
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:30,779
with over prescribing or overdosing to

1635
01:21:28,769 --> 01:21:33,239
get the analgesic effect that they need

1636
01:21:30,779 --> 01:21:34,918
because of some real pain that's going

1637
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:37,978
on in their body and then they get

1638
01:21:34,918 --> 01:21:40,168
hooked you know the common story I got

1639
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:42,719
in a car accident got prescribed vicodin

1640
01:21:40,168 --> 01:21:45,269
if I couldn't let the percocet percocet

1641
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,529
led to this that it it and I open

1642
01:21:45,269 --> 01:21:50,340
prescription

1643
01:21:46,529 --> 01:21:52,519
yeah I'm chillin on the streets yeah so

1644
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:55,349
that's a pretty common story so I think

1645
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:57,659
studies like that which until I heard

1646
01:21:55,349 --> 01:22:02,460
that I'm like oh using cannabinoids with

1647
01:21:57,658 --> 01:22:03,448
with Pharma like I don't know if that's

1648
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:06,538
good or bad

1649
01:22:03,448 --> 01:22:11,038
you know my my humble hippie side of me

1650
01:22:06,538 --> 01:22:12,899
would say that like probably bad but my

1651
01:22:11,038 --> 01:22:14,340
scientific mind says man like I want to

1652
01:22:12,899 --> 01:22:16,799
see like results with some studies like

1653
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:19,770
that if you could like it reduces him

1654
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,690
the amount I mean if if it if it

1655
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:26,039
increases the efficacy yeah I don't I

1656
01:22:21,689 --> 01:22:29,009
don't care if it's you know like I don't

1657
01:22:26,038 --> 01:22:31,800
care who I'm dancing who it's dancing

1658
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:35,099
with or what it's doing I care about if

1659
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:39,779
it's decreasing the the need for that

1660
01:22:35,099 --> 01:22:42,929
other that other component yeah I mean I

1661
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:46,349
guess there's a Puritan as a Puritan

1662
01:22:42,929 --> 01:22:48,719
like we it might not seem like it's the

1663
01:22:46,349 --> 01:22:53,610
best best bet but usually it's just like

1664
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:55,679
try to take the find you know find out

1665
01:22:53,609 --> 01:22:57,899
for sure like I'm not that guy that goes

1666
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:00,569
around saying cannabis absolutely can't

1667
01:22:57,899 --> 01:23:02,908
kill you a cannabis camp like you harm

1668
01:23:00,569 --> 01:23:04,380
you in any way like I don't know that

1669
01:23:02,908 --> 01:23:06,149
like I don't think so

1670
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:08,340
I've definitely I should have been

1671
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:11,429
harmed if it was a man who's gonna harm

1672
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:14,250
me but I mean I did see you crawling

1673
01:23:11,429 --> 01:23:17,730
across it Oh about a hundred yards a

1674
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:20,760
cannabis but then that's cuz he got he

1675
01:23:17,729 --> 01:23:23,098
got brave with the dabs no no I was lied

1676
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:26,520
to by someone this this guy

1677
01:23:23,099 --> 01:23:31,739
I have 39th birthday I had he makes me a

1678
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:34,139
39 in oil about you know this size it

1679
01:23:31,738 --> 01:23:36,598
was about that big and I think two grams

1680
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:38,219
oil and I'm like back then I didn't

1681
01:23:36,599 --> 01:23:40,800
really smoke or all that much I was a

1682
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:42,750
traditional guy and he's like yeah I'm

1683
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,369
like I'm like that seems like a lot you

1684
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:46,198
know I only spoke like a little bit of

1685
01:23:44,368 --> 01:23:48,630
this so far he's like I don't know it's

1686
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:51,058
like pretty much the same and so it ends

1687
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:54,090
up he just drops the the circle of the

1688
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:57,000
nine into the dish I'm like all right

1689
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:58,260
took the whole thing and mediate was

1690
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,279
like oh that's

1691
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:04,199
good that's not gonna be a good day and

1692
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:05,939
tried to get out of his front door on

1693
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:08,819
one side of the property was about a

1694
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:12,329
hundred yards from my backdoor and I

1695
01:24:08,819 --> 01:24:15,750
made that crawl like across the pond up

1696
01:24:12,329 --> 01:24:21,470
a hill like barely couldn't see couldn't

1697
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:24,930
barely move yeah yeah like terrible

1698
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:27,810
vomited all over myself like it was just

1699
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:28,650
the worst night I mean I don't see me

1700
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:36,180
until the next day

1701
01:24:28,649 --> 01:24:37,799
and he was very arrested actually I

1702
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:41,520
don't know if it was the next day or the

1703
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:45,270
day after the next day yeah okay on the

1704
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:47,490
hot seat with a hard question a patent

1705
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:49,620
application or a fruit patent and

1706
01:24:47,489 --> 01:24:51,869
actually I'm gonna expand it that you're

1707
01:24:49,619 --> 01:24:54,239
either concerned by or like that's

1708
01:24:51,869 --> 01:24:56,069
totally clever and ingenious and they

1709
01:24:54,239 --> 01:25:03,260
deserve that cool

1710
01:24:56,069 --> 01:25:06,090
I don't as for I'm I don't seem much

1711
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:11,940
many enforceable patents that really

1712
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:13,920
that concerned me there's yeah there is

1713
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:15,149
like there's always there's a million

1714
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:19,649
ways to skin a cat

1715
01:25:15,149 --> 01:25:22,559
so technological patents are they're not

1716
01:25:19,649 --> 01:25:24,449
a big concern but the things that really

1717
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,300
interest me are the the patents coming

1718
01:25:24,449 --> 01:25:30,840
out regarding like technological

1719
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:32,970
advances regarding condensation of

1720
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:36,750
ethanol that we use in our processes

1721
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:41,070
which a guy that I know through

1722
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:43,770
Instagram I've been he's been developing

1723
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:47,069
he's from Yellowstone extractions has

1724
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:50,100
been developing a method of instead of

1725
01:25:47,069 --> 01:25:53,659
using chillers to condense ethanol

1726
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:58,620
vapors and falling film evaporator using

1727
01:25:53,659 --> 01:26:00,269
diffusion and pressure and then passing

1728
01:25:58,619 --> 01:26:03,869
that heat out just into the atmosphere

1729
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:08,580
and really reducing the amount of energy

1730
01:26:03,869 --> 01:26:10,890
costs it's it was super innovative I've

1731
01:26:08,579 --> 01:26:13,529
been talking to the guy for

1732
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:16,440
past year-and-a-half as he's been

1733
01:26:13,529 --> 01:26:18,630
developing this and he's just kind of

1734
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:20,159
giving me a little breadcrumbs along the

1735
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:24,109
trail to tell me what's going on and

1736
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:27,529
finally here but released this

1737
01:26:24,109 --> 01:26:32,149
patent-pending technology that really is

1738
01:26:27,529 --> 01:26:40,469
it's awesome for the industrial scale

1739
01:26:32,149 --> 01:26:42,509
condensation of ethanol it's going to

1740
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:45,110
reduce the amount of electricity that is

1741
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:55,170
that I use for recovering ethanol

1742
01:26:45,109 --> 01:26:57,630
greatly yes yeah totally yeah I'm going

1743
01:26:55,170 --> 01:27:00,239
to buy his systems from him as a an

1744
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:04,560
add-on to my system I tripled the

1745
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:08,219
capacity of the yeah of a standard

1746
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:16,380
evaporator and get it really well

1747
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:19,530
like he it's sexy yeah and so he

1748
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:20,970
obviously has a wish list of toys he

1749
01:27:19,529 --> 01:27:23,819
wants to play over there either one who

1750
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:28,380
has to approve budgets yep we kind of

1751
01:27:23,819 --> 01:27:30,869
argue over it has been pretty easy you

1752
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:40,010
know yeah there's better what's your

1753
01:27:30,869 --> 01:27:42,029
current favorite toy in my a membrane

1754
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:45,510
ethanol recovery system that we

1755
01:27:42,029 --> 01:27:48,479
developed herself we've figured out a

1756
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:52,020
way to recover ethanol everybody thought

1757
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:56,250
that to separate ethanol from oil you

1758
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:58,530
need to distill it and so there takes

1759
01:27:56,250 --> 01:28:01,939
that takes a decent amount of energy to

1760
01:27:58,529 --> 01:28:05,939
just it to vaporize ethanol and then

1761
01:28:01,939 --> 01:28:10,799
reconvince it so we have developed a

1762
01:28:05,939 --> 01:28:15,919
method to mechanically separate ethanol

1763
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:20,310
from our from our crude stream with a

1764
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:22,789
fraction of the energy so we use you

1765
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:26,539
know less than 30 amps to recover one

1766
01:28:22,789 --> 01:28:32,810
50 gallons an hour when that would be an

1767
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:37,220
average around 200 250 amps that 200 220

1768
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:41,870
volts so our energy efficiency has gone

1769
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:44,000
through the roof and it's a technology

1770
01:28:41,869 --> 01:28:47,210
that's going to actually open up the

1771
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:52,119
ability for large-scale ethanol

1772
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:55,609
extraction and using like using ethanol

1773
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:58,849
potentially as a solvent for other

1774
01:28:55,609 --> 01:29:01,279
industries not just cannabinoids but

1775
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:06,200
because it's been proven as a recovery

1776
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:08,359
method and it has a it's it's a heavier

1777
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:11,599
molecule that takes more energy it

1778
01:29:08,359 --> 01:29:13,549
hasn't been used much in extraction

1779
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:16,100
industries but now the fact that it's

1780
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:19,489
been proven to be able to separate be

1781
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:22,240
separated in industrial scales there's

1782
01:29:19,489 --> 01:29:24,800
the potential it'll be used not just in

1783
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:27,170
cannabis oil production but oil

1784
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,029
production across several different

1785
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:32,390
industries so this is kind of like how

1786
01:29:29,029 --> 01:29:36,469
the porn industry LED innovation and

1787
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:39,380
digital media monetization we hope so

1788
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:47,230
and cannabis is introducing new

1789
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:47,230
techniques that is happening grassroots

1790
01:29:47,329 --> 01:29:53,449
[Music]

1791
01:29:49,149 --> 01:29:55,549
totally and and the this ridiculous

1792
01:29:53,449 --> 01:29:57,079
thing ridiculously cool thing about it

1793
01:29:55,550 --> 01:30:00,110
is that it's all like grassroots

1794
01:29:57,079 --> 01:30:02,390
oriented like we're were two guys who

1795
01:30:00,109 --> 01:30:04,789
you know started growing small-scale and

1796
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:06,770
then just kind of grew grew grew in this

1797
01:30:04,789 --> 01:30:08,779
industry and like I think that's the

1798
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:10,910
same for all the the tech guys in our

1799
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:14,779
space like most of the innovation isn't

1800
01:30:10,909 --> 01:30:18,139
coming from from large females which

1801
01:30:14,779 --> 01:30:21,859
process these research firms like with

1802
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:25,139
any large R&amp;D budgets it's coming from

1803
01:30:21,859 --> 01:30:27,929
people that are doing out of passion and

1804
01:30:25,139 --> 01:30:31,789
and necessity for me smokers yeah

1805
01:30:27,929 --> 01:30:31,789
straight up yeah
