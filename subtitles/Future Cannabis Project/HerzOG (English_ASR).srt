honey so it can has this little gassy

27
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,579
earthy touch with the sweetness at the

28
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:41,409
ends so it's really really awesome

bringing out new strains it's really

38
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:17,810
progressive business you know everybody

39
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:20,829
wants to push the frontier we all want

40
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,530
the worldwide legalization so we can

41
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,130
traffic cannabis globally that would be

42
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,509
awesome

Europe because got this medical aspect

46
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:43,520
which is really important to me also but

47
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:47,150
it's also important to bring up the

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:50,689
structures from the future when THC is

49
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,819
legal we have already had set up all

50
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:54,289
those structures you know that was

51
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:56,120
really important that why we started

52
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:59,239

53

know gotta be patient you've got to be

57
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:16,849
confident and you got to visualize the

58
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:21,069
future and the upcoming events which may

59
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:21,069
be mostly positive

60
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,919
