00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,880
[Music]

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,670
chatting about people's experiences with

3
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:20,618
metric and integrating onto metric

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,949
that's something they're starting to

5
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:25,269
roll out Provisionals and annuals and so

6
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,520
more and more people are starting to get

7
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:31,509
experience with that and we are in the

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,659
process of that as well so just really

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:40,359
trying to oh right

10
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:42,728
flowing reviews super easy yeah and

11
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:47,319
really kind of how it's working with

12
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:50,189
some of the so as a retailer we were not

13
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:52,838
anticipating to have to order tags and

14
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:54,369
tagging products because tags were

15
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:56,469
supposed to be applied at the cultivator

16
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:57,968
level but not everybody has an annual

17
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:00,489
license which is when you get the tags

18
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:02,469
or provisional so the way that they're

19
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:04,750
handling that because the rules state

20
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:08,769
that anybody with a provisional or

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,750
annual has to be on metric they they're

22
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:13,179
making any part of the supply chain get

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,069
tags so how it's where I'm just

24
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,230
wondering how people are making it work

25
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:19,329
and and I want to talk with you about

26
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,810
this later if you I don't know where you

27
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,810
are in your

28
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,219
so we're just getting started with our

29
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,049
Account Manager training so as

30
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:39,340
Provisionals we're coming on board and

31
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:43,929
we are planning all-nighters with staff

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,909
to QR code the world in terms of for

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,850
retail stuff writing it's just to get

34
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:51,640
all of the tagging done is going to be

35
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:55,000
really challenging right we're just

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,650
preparing for the initial tagging of all

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,599
of the inventory to be the big mountain

38
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,940
and then hopefully once everything in

39
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,429
inventory is tagged then we can tag

40
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:06,069
things as we receive it and it won't be

41
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,900
as much of a challenge and that will

42
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:10,000
start to become integrated but I think

43
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,039
the first time when we get everything

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,990
into inventory and metric is gonna be

45
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,900
the hardest because some of our issues

46
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:20,080
are not all of our vendors have

47
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,439
Provisionals or annuals and therefore

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:28,360
are non metric and don't need to have

49
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:30,520
tags and some distributors do some of

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,610
the products that other distributors

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,890
that don't have one do and so we're very

52
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:41,230
much gauging like the number of actually

53
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:43,439
provisional or annually license vendors

54
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:45,459
that we work with and versus how many

55
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,750
products we're gonna have to be tagging

56
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,479
ourselves and that was something that

57
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,129
was never anticipated that kind of

58
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,829
defeats the whole point of track and

59
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,629
trace in my opinion because we're just

60
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,980
it's just going one more step and it's

61
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:00,039
supposed to come from the cultivator but

62
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:03,549
I think that nobody anticipated the

63
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:05,439
rollout and the sort of the imbalance of

64
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,709
temporary licenses to provisional

65
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,539
licenses and so making that work at this

66
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,378
stage has become a little bit more

67
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:14,929
complicated than

68
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:16,968
originally thought for sure there's

69
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,920
there's been some guidance about if you

70
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:24,468
are working with vendors that don't have

71
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:26,688
unique identification in metric yet what

72
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:28,400
you do mm-hmm but it remains to be seen

73
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:32,090
what that's like when we're actually

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,549
doing it yeah and so that's I'm trying

75
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,650
to find somebody that's been doing it

76
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:39,170
but there's so few people most people

77
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,569
are in this exact stage that were in so

78
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,848
none of us really it's kind of like when

79
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:46,158
we first started with the manifests and

80
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:49,548
the excise tax and like when that first

81
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:51,918
rolled out and we were all there all

82
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,989
figuring it out as we go and and not

83
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,419
everybody apparently saw that there was

84
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:57,590
a sample form that was on a website that

85
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:59,560
people could use so people were making

86
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:03,650
their own forms and then there were

87
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:07,069
discussions on or maybe debates between

88
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,709
the distributors and retailers over like

89
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:11,810
who collects what and how much and who

90
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,400
keeps what records and and how that

91
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,949
whole thing works and I feel like this

92
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,639
is probably gonna be very similar to

93
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:21,500
that process one thing that I stay up at

94
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:26,000
night thinking about in relation to

95
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:28,339
metric is our planned dependency on our

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,550
third-party software providers for POS

97
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:33,859
and for our seed to sale tracking at

98
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,069
cultivation and distribution and and how

99
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,050
we've received promises over the last

100
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:41,408
year or so as we've on-boarded these

101
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:46,699
different tools that they are going to

102
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:49,550
integrate and that moment when it turns

103
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:53,900
on yeah how well it really integrates

104
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:56,750
and and if that is going to add to the

105
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:59,598
complication or be a support because

106
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,639
obviously when you are using a

107
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:03,408
third-party software provider to

108
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,090
integrate with metric the hope is that

109
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:07,158
that added cost is gonna bring you

110
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:09,319
benefit operationally it's gonna be more

111
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:10,370
efficient it's gonna save you time it's

112
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,689
gonna give you better business

113
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:17,439
intelligence but we don't really know

114
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:18,579
right and the software tools our company

115
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,439
because we operate across the supply

116
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:22,779
chain we have multiple different

117
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,579
software providers that we're using that

118
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:27,969
are all claiming that they'll integrate

119
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:29,589
with metric right but then they all are

120
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,540
positive they were at the same moment

121
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:34,439
they're also all rolling out new

122
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,939
versions so the metric integration works

123
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,430
[Music]

124
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:41,259
so yeah yeah I'll be asking people of

125
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,180
meadowlands if they have any experience

126
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:45,939
with that yet that's that's something

127
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:51,699
I'm very curious to hear and I just saw

128
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:56,110
one of our vendors is has a on metric

129
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:58,300
and has a code and I I get sort of I

130
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,500
asked I was it's very very long code I

131
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,720
don't even know how many digits there

132
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,519
are but there's a barcode too and I

133
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,940
think there's a question of whether or

134
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:12,159
not the POS system or inventory system

135
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:14,319
can actually I'm like I hope it reads it

136
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:21,670
can read the the barcode because that's

137
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:23,949
gonna be a lot of manual input no

138
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,840
they're all issued by metric or if you

139
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:31,930
if you aren't on metric yet you don't

140
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:33,489
have a metric ID right but you said yeah

141
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,480
which implies that you've seen other ID

142
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,220
numbers that very much

143
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:40,330
no I'd never that was actually the first

144
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,530
real if I ever saw yeah our buyer just

145
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:45,339
sent me a picture of it because I was

146
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:46,389
asking and it was it's it's long and and

147
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:49,299
then I saw I was like okay there's a

148
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:53,740
barcode I just hope that her spinner can

149
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,389
breathe for all intensive purposes early

150
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,250
June 2019

151
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,250
you're literally seeing your first

152
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,600
metric

153
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,759
bar code whatever you want to call it

154
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,370
we're not on metric yet we're going

155
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:12,579
through the training process right now

156
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:17,829
but mid yeah I mean very soon but I one

157
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:19,359
of our distributors is on metric so and

158
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:21,459
I was I've been asking like did anything

159
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,759
change with their process and how they

160
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:26,079
were dealing with us and just kind of a

161
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,860
lot of information gathered you're

162
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,389
trying to learn

163
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:39,100
nobody really it's too new we'll get

164
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:41,470
there within 30 days after you get your

165
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:45,850
provisional vari-angle and did you just

166
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:47,680
get your dollar annual recently yeah

167
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,479
okay so you're in that the clock is

168
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,310
ticking for you yeah but there's

169
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:54,310
different phases going on in the supply

170
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:57,250
chain so all of the cultivators their

171
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,160
temporaries expired earlier before the

172
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:03,759
retailer's so theoretically a lot of the

173
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,760
cultivation licensees would have been on

174
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,129
metric yeah now but it's taking a while

175
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:12,069
for metric to onboard people because

176
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:14,529
while the licensees have 30 days from

177
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:17,279
when they get the invitation to do the

178
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:20,379
accountmanager training there is a bit

179
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,779
that is dependent on the state inviting

180
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:27,370
you to that trainings cajoling the

181
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:30,250
onboarding and the the supply chain just

182
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,459
not everybody's on it right and and

183
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,820
because of that the retailers are gonna

184
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:38,799
have to be tagging products for

185
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,528
distributors or supply chain members

186
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,490
that are not on it

187
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:44,210
well the ones that have provisional

188
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:49,690
licenses it's very complex

189
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,690
[Laughter]

190
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,500
interesting but it's definitely the next

191
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:59,290
but this is what your like your slide

192
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,879
digital what about I mean you were

193
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,579
talking about certain things where I

194
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,259
feel like in an ideal world a phone call

195
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:11,170
to the regulators to get clarification

196
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:13,590
on my confusion is like the different

197
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:16,529
regulatory agencies have different

198
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:20,710
interpretations of different lines in

199
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:23,379
the law right and some of you adhere to

200
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,660
one regulatory agency so you're going to

201
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:28,059
listen to what they say whereas you have

202
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:31,179
a reached out and the brain right yeah

203
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:32,379
but I don't I'm not seeing regulatory

204
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:35,069
agencies having different

205
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:37,149
interpretations of the law luckily I

206
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,780
would say that there are regulations

207
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:43,139
that might be challenging for businesses

208
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:46,439
that we have to navigate but I'm not

209
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:48,879
having the BCC tell me one thing and

210
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:53,830
CDFA tell me something that conflict

211
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:56,470
with BCC you are well I went in just

212
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,780
strictly looking at the regulations as

213
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,370
written a was worse in a previous

214
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:01,870
version of regulations they've done a

215
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,629
lot of really good work to clean that up

216
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:08,860
and and be more consistent across the

217
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:11,259
board so the the issues that were really

218
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,779
outstanding to me aren't they

219
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:15,220
those have been mitigated now at this

220
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:19,120
point so there's nothing I mean I could

221
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:21,519
still see certain conflicts when one

222
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,049
might be able to argue and like between

223
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,419
state law and some of these regulations

224
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:31,539
I think you know it depends on what

225
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:36,059
lawyer you ask on what day well okay so

226
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:38,620
in in mal curse' it says that all

227
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:42,329
cannabis and cannabis products have to

228
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:48,279
be in a child resistant tamper-evident

229
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:49,780
resealable package so cannabis the

230
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:55,689
definition of cannabis means everything

231
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:58,919
and although I so the regulator's they

232
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,560
say and I think rightly so are exempting

233
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:05,259
clones and seeds from

234
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:08,949
portions of that rule one might say that

235
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:13,230
it's you know kind of differs it wasn't

236
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:15,790
it all addressed or clarified in the

237
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:19,110
previous version and they were different

238
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:22,959
between because CD pH didn't address

239
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:25,330
clones or seeds because they were mostly

240
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,290
focused on manufactured products I think

241
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:31,270
the closest was pre-rolls with extract

242
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,610
Cena was the closest thing so there was

243
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:35,289
no pre-roll regulation we were having

244
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,879
debates with vendors about whether or

245
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:39,429
not the universal symbols applied

246
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,259
because they were like well you only DPH

247
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:43,000
it's only responsible for these things

248
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:44,679
and they're the ones that say universal

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,110
symbol and we don't have to have one and

250
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:49,719
then we go well no this is the law says

251
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:54,879
you do and the way I look at it is the

252
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,590
MAL curses like the Bible and the

253
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,710
regulations are like the gospel so like

254
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,149
when in doubt go to the law and then go

255
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,440
to the regulation some people work

256
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:04,419
backwards I think it depends on the

257
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,550
situation too like you really it's not

258
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:09,610
black and white there's there's a lot of

259
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:11,979
nuance and a lot of like the if you're

260
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:15,940
in line with the intent of what the law

261
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,110
is and what 64 is and and you work

262
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,030
towards that which is something I said

263
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,389
on the panel like you can prove your

264
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:24,370
intent to comply be within you know the

265
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:26,799
letter and the spirit to the best of

266
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:30,629
your ability then that's that is the

267
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:35,099
best approach in a confusing complicated

268
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:35,100
ambiguous developing industry

269
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:41,009
she's really smart
