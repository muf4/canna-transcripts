1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
[Music]

2
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:11,149
I'm Gary corlett with Southern

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,160
California Edison

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm Brian Anderson with Anderson Porter

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,170
design one architecture firm based in

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,850
Cambridge Mass and now newly here in in

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,679
Fullerton California yeah the

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,109
interesting thing here is what is is

9
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,160
that you know we're here at this event

10
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:30,720
talking about cannabis growing and

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,140
talking about indoor indoor agriculture

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,179
and how growers interface use utilities

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,270
how architects and facility design

14
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,429
interfaces with the utility early right

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,289
that's one of the things that we really

16
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:47,820
encourage is that cultivators get in

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,050
touch with us early on in the process

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,000
get us involved it's there's a couple of

19
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:59,578
things that about the electrical system

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,759
a lot of lot of things so let's start

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,609
with the the devant issues yeah all

22
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:09,379
right we we operate on a ten year

23
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:14,908
planning skill plan so we we plan out

24
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:17,609
our grid enhancements ten years in

25
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,520
advance because it takes us that long it

26
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,079
takes if we want to relocate a

27
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:26,090
distribution line it takes a year to two

28
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:28,289
years to do that if we want to upgrade a

29
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:31,320
substation it could take us three to

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,390
five years to do that or if we build a

31
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,639
new substation it could take five to

32
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,549
seven years and what kind of what kind

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,030
of crimp in your system does it count as

34
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,880
a one cannabis facility what crimp in

35
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,379
your system does 12 or what is a hundred

36
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,929
thousand square feet of canopy or two

37
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,899
and a thousands maybe canopy effect your

38
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,368
ten-year planning cycle so let's take

39
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,868
the first off it depends on where

40
00:01:53,368 --> 00:02:01,829
they're at so you know in California a

41
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,819
megawatt of power will power about 750

42
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:07,258
homes yeah

43
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:10,728
a small facility a cannabis facility is

44
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:14,568
you know easily 1 to 3 megawatts

45
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:17,690
it's it's in an area of 10 to 20,000

46
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:21,439
square feet so now we're putting you

47
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:23,509
know 750 to 2,500 homes in the

48
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:27,949
equivalent of 20,000 square feet

49
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:30,079
our grids typically aren't built out to

50
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,579
provide that type of power in that in

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,019
that density and there's no coordination

52
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:37,969
between farmers or is there coordination

53
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:40,010
between farmers and planting boards and

54
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:41,989
the utility as a bike great because as

55
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,348
an industry were pushed right there's

56
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:45,409
stigma

57
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:46,878
we're pushed into areas that that's what

58
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:49,818
zoned for us we can't go anywhere else

59
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,469
right and but is that coordinated with

60
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:55,009
you does that help you what does that

61
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:58,840
hinder you it in some cases it can

62
00:02:55,009 --> 00:03:01,449
hinder us just in the in being able to

63
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:06,348
to meet the demand

64
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:10,909
you know we've got cannabis in

65
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:13,909
particular has gone into low population

66
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:17,780
areas where they're well they're more

67
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:20,870
just underserved areas underserved

68
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,519
communities and so there aren't a lot of

69
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:29,539
industrial businesses in those areas

70
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,879
your mower zone for residential or you

71
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:35,030
know small industrial and then when you

72
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:37,098
bring in a cannabis facility now you're

73
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,209
talking about major loads that the

74
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:40,280
infrastructure does be a minute

75
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:43,069
structure wasn't prepared for it and had

76
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,689
we known you know 10 years ago that it

77
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:46,339
was coming we could have planned for it

78
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:48,829
but so when's the right time when's the

79
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,689
right time for the you know for the

80
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,340
farmer for the cannabis you know indoor

81
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,689
grower for the outdoor grew it not the

82
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,150
outdoor but let's say mixed light grower

83
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:58,699
to alert you like when's the right time

84
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,950
in their planning process they start

85
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:03,589
talking to you is it you directly or is

86
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:06,259
there is there a team that is this yeah

87
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:10,609
so they need to contact their local

88
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:12,108
planner yeah so we have planners in each

89
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:14,150
of our districts and they take care of

90
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:15,379
you to the individual cities and

91
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,980
counties yeah

92
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:22,759
and they can look at the grid in that

93
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,259
particular area and then decide what

94
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,449
needs to be done to provide them with

95
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:29,060
the capacity they may tell them that we

96
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:32,979
can't get you a capacity for you know it

97
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,629
could be two or three years right

98
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,340
but you know always we will get your

99
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:40,250
capacity but it may not be on the time

100
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:42,109
frame that you're looking for so that's

101
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,569
the first step and you should do that as

102
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,220
early in the process as possible as soon

103
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:49,069
as you start thinking that that you're

104
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,110
going to be meeting that that load then

105
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:52,699
you need to go to the planner and talk

106
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,340
to them about what you have do you need

107
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:57,110
to have a full one-line diagram produced

108
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:59,060
by it by an electrical engineer in order

109
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,670
to begin the process what can you just

110
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,319
start talking in generalities well you

111
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,530
can talk in generalities but you won't

112
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:08,839
get into the system until you have one

113
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:11,079
line drawing okay and there's there's

114
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:14,479
fees associated with with doing that

115
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:16,609
well yeah that means so you know as an

116
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,350
architect one line drawing is comes out

117
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:23,840
of you know three to two months of

118
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,580
planning work before before the engineer

119
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,079
is prepared has enough basis of design

120
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:28,430
notice how many plants are gonna go in

121
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,139
those how many lights going those how

122
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,660
much water is being used right in order

123
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:36,319
from electrical perspective to to say

124
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:38,450
plunk load light load HVAC load here's

125
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,120
what I need for amperage right so we've

126
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:44,240
got we you know that the arktech grow

127
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,500
team in the farmer have two months of

128
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,139
work to do before we can give you what

129
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,209
you need to drop the power well it's

130
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,360
it's it's at that point that your

131
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:54,799
service order to service it to get into

132
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,050
our system where we start and really

133
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,030
planning it yeah and agreeing out how to

134
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,210
do it now it'll be two years from that

135
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:06,079
point till we could get a drop possibly

136
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:08,479
so I mean we do things as quickly as

137
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,359
possible two things happen first off

138
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,009
when they get in in line we we operate

139
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,170
on a first-come first-serve basis first

140
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:20,000
one at 9:00 this first one gets out

141
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:22,530
and there's no jumping in the line so

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,759
you know basically that's one of the

143
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,609
reasons you want to get into the queue

144
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,810
as soon as possible because you know

145
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,280
they have to work through the queue to

146
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:35,310
get to your project before they can

147
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:38,629
design it and install it right and so so

148
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,240
one of the things are you know affecting

149
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:43,079
power delivery beyond the timing of it

150
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,470
what are the other

151
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:49,409
so is it location yeah it's location so

152
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:54,360
you know think about our our grid in

153
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:56,880
terms of ductwork or an irrigation

154
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,350
system so you start out with a larger

155
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,290
line at the very beginning because you

156
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,780
got a lot a lot of flow and then as you

157
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,569
get further out on that steps down to

158
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:09,419
keep the pressure up our electrical grid

159
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:12,899
is exactly the same way so the further

160
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:16,410
out away from our our power sources we

161
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,699
get the smaller the line sizes are and

162
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,480
that means that there's less capacity

163
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:27,589
out there right so it's important to

164
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:29,970
know where you are on our grid and how

165
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:34,709
capacity limited the grid is at that

166
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:36,420
point so just quickly can you talk I

167
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:38,519
want to get specific with some

168
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,439
geographic markets like you deal with

169
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,229
Carpinteria there's lots of cannabis

170
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,990
cultivation there Valley downtown Los

171
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:48,569
Angeles kind of what's what some stuff

172
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,930
you're seeing in each of those yeah so

173
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:54,509
we write cannabis cultivation market yes

174
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:58,490
so just a clarification

175
00:07:54,509 --> 00:08:03,389
Edison doesn't cover the LA proper

176
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:05,129
that's handled by LADWP and so i don't

177
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:11,399
know what their issues are in there but

178
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:15,120
but in in in Carpinteria Carpinteria and

179
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:18,149
santa bárbara areas are actually

180
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,509
impacted areas for us it has to do with

181
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:23,539
they basically have one main

182
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:27,949
transmission line into that area

183
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:31,069
and and it's already is is impacted so

184
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:35,779
growers wanting to add capacity add to

185
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:40,009
that impact in we look at other

186
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:43,370
facilities like Desert Hot Springs we

187
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:45,350
have in Desert Hot Springs there's a lot

188
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,950
of transmission that comes through there

189
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,240
but we didn't necessarily have the

190
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,790
distribution capacity to do that because

191
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:57,830
that area was initially it was going to

192
00:08:52,789 --> 00:09:00,349
be five acre home Lots right and and now

193
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,629
we're putting 10,000 and 20,000 square

194
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,000
foot cannabis facilities on there each

195
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:09,169
of them you know in a 1 to 3 or 4

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,779
megawatt requirement so that taxes us as

197
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:16,399
well because we weren't the the grid at

198
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:19,490
that area wasn't designed for the load

199
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,769
that's out there now so to take Desert

200
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,779
Hot Springs as a specific example what

201
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,029
are you projecting let's say three years

202
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:29,339
from now the demand from the cannabis

203
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:35,819
community and Desert Hot Springs

204
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:38,070
I yeah your plan yeah that's big yeah we

205
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,560
we don't have the numbers off the top of

206
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,790
my head that's in the pipe here that is

207
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,439
what your team is working on this figure

208
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:46,049
yeah what tries it's gonna grow help

209
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:51,360
make it's gonna grow we've put this much

210
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:53,039
does the facility design affect power

211
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,389
consumption are there right in it just

212
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,459
in terms of an indoor crow versus a

213
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:58,610
mixed light grower do you do you take

214
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:04,160
that into account when you project out

215
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:07,590
we tried to yeah so we're seeing in

216
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:12,089
indoor crows that we're averaging about

217
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:13,980
35 watts per square foot that's that's

218
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,660
that is that's that's down when we first

219
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,430
started a couple of years ago where

220
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:20,370
we're looking at 51 watts per square

221
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:20,939
foot so we're getting more efficient as

222
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,980
we go along

223
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,400
do you let's try me II was driving this

224
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,740
is that just data it's just data now

225
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,720
that we're getting better data on it we

226
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,409
did when we first started looking at it

227
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,820
we really didn't have a lot of data and

228
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:37,919
and now as we've gotten more data we're

229
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,320
getting better numbers we're getting

230
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:45,169
better at estimating what the loads are

231
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:48,360
going to be that's an indoor throw yeah

232
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:50,339
the greenhouse grows I don't have the

233
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,409
specific number but it's probably in the

234
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,410
range of 15 to 20 watts per square foot

235
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,840
so it's it does matter can you know a

236
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:04,299
lot and then the addition is the

237
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,269
greenhouses typically are conditioned

238
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:10,750
with water walls and basically swamp

239
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:13,240
coolers and indoor grows are typically

240
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,960
done with B X units package units and so

241
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,110
a lot less efficient and then the

242
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:23,259
evaporative cooling is there any is

243
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,000
there any call in so you represent do

244
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:28,870
represent gas as well as electric we're

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,139
not just just less electric so yeah then

246
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,429
to speculate differences in guess so we

247
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,629
see nationally you know a lot of

248
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:37,329
difference between gas prices and

249
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:39,220
electric prices will drive choice of

250
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,530
cooling systems let's talk about indoor

251
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,210
I'm speaking silly but indoor grows or

252
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:45,159
closed environment greenhouses that

253
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,570
aren't open air so closed air

254
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:48,879
greenhouses or or full indoor

255
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,520
environments make decisions on using

256
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,769
shale are you know chilled water and

257
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,110
show systems versus DX and electrical

258
00:11:53,769 --> 00:12:01,240
systems based on based on energy price

259
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:02,500
yeah so is there any way to I mean I'm

260
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,879
speculating here I guess you're reaching

261
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,100
for something but say this is there any

262
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:08,620
these gas availability similar to

263
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,290
electrical availability in in new

264
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:14,710
markets yeah specific markets and if

265
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:17,199
they are would there be any relief for

266
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,090
for the electrical demand if people were

267
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,790
considering something other than a DX

268
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:24,499
system because yeah so

269
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:26,958
there the gas has the same problems that

270
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:28,730
we do in terms of their pipelines they

271
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,109
have a major in Desert Hot Springs in

272
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,959
particularly they have a major pipeline

273
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,759
that runs through that valley but they

274
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,799
don't have major gas lines coming off of

275
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:41,360
it that they don't have it yeah so their

276
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,178
gas system distribution system is

277
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,100
similar to ours and in that taking

278
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:48,259
plants it's you know plant and they're

279
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,860
planning yeah that the 10-year plan is

280
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:53,778
is because none of our equipment is off

281
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,480
the shelf it's all custom-built right

282
00:12:53,778 --> 00:13:00,399
and so that's a two to three year

283
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,600
process of getting that and then the

284
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,919
everything that we do when it's major

285
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,269
construction like that has to be

286
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,389
approved by the Public Utilities

287
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:10,278
Commission so bureaucracy yeah and and

288
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,259
so it just takes time for that to happen

289
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:14,778
that could be a two to three year

290
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:16,009
process itself so given that it would

291
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:17,269
still make sense right because it's

292
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:18,558
gonna take these it's gonna take this

293
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,610
amount of time just to get electric it's

294
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:22,088
gonna take this amount of time to get

295
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:24,829
gas right and I'm looking at ways to

296
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,540
decrease load so if load and load

297
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:29,919
distributions is affecting all of us

298
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:34,099
from homeowners to indoor AG growers

299
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:35,208
what is there is a future zero what is

300
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,409
the position here in Southern California

301
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:43,568
on on dividing your operation into both

302
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:46,039
gas and electric so California has a

303
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:49,278
goal to be decarbonized

304
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:51,678
by 2045 which means that essentially gas

305
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:55,759
will not for the most part not be

306
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:57,259
available for for most things okay so

307
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,579
this is this is interesting right

308
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:01,200
because around the country this is a

309
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:04,259
conversation that's starting which is

310
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,950
we understand from a carbon perspective

311
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:09,990
that if we have renewable electrical

312
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,000
sources that is our goal we would want

313
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,279
to do all-electric homes right

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,820
all-electric cannabis grows all-electric

315
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,199
indoor AG if we can get our get looking

316
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,580
at our electricity from a renewable

317
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,490
source but what happens when our

318
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:26,940
electrical generation is from 30%

319
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,590
efficient gas-fired plants or from maybe

320
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,440
even lower efficiency Coldfire

321
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,850
coal-fired plants so aiming for the same

322
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,330
goals aiming for carbon neutrality

323
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:39,060
aiming for efficiency there are really

324
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,490
efficient on-site gas systems that are

325
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:43,889
up around 80% efficient today right I'm

326
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,740
not saying no system that we install is

327
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:48,539
gonna last forever right my boiler in my

328
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,909
house is I'm is maybe gonna last you

329
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:52,799
know 10 years if I'm lucky right I know

330
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:54,689
I'm gonna replace this system so let me

331
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,509
say who is there an opportunity to was

332
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,670
installed today a gas-fired system

333
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:02,189
because it's 80% efficient knowing that

334
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:04,399
in 30 years to meet the 2045 goal well

335
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,600
that's not for the prettiest ways 25

336
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,480
years I'm definitely gonna replace that

337
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,290
system right there's there's no question

338
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,509
and I'm not saying that there aren't

339
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:17,339
opportunities to do those types of

340
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:20,039
things that the challenges is harder

341
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:23,070
because of the policy that says we're

342
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:26,639
driving towards total electrification

343
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:29,160
the the goal is for California's by 2050

344
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,720
or there abouts to be what are those

345
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,969
powers general what are the Janet where

346
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,950
is it where we are we buying power from

347
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,830
from Utah and it's cold fire don't we

348
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,620
blow it's that's in in California terms

349
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:42,150
it's it's all renewable where's the

350
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,970
percentage of renewable today can you do

351
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:47,189
you know that for our great it's about

352
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,540
30 little over 30 percent 30 percent

353
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,540
renewable right now much higher than

354
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:55,829
other places the country right and our

355
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:58,149
goal as a company is to be 70 percent by

356
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,879
for 2045

357
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:02,169
so what are some things then let's take

358
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,809
that let's take energy efficiency and

359
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:06,278
carbon neutrality how does that flow

360
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:08,379
from a criminal from your perspective

361
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:09,818
from all of our goals what are some

362
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:11,470
efficiency things that you'd like to see

363
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:13,870
in terms of in terms of indoor plant

364
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,269
growth like what is it is it L is it LED

365
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,560
lighting is that is that a big game

366
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:19,089
chance so I was talking about right yeah

367
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,049
I was talking about cooling loads right

368
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:21,370
well right only ones if we're growing

369
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:26,078
with HPS we know we have a lot of

370
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:28,139
cooling right and if we stick with a DX

371
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,129
system or some sort of direct exchange

372
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,539
what about lighting is there ways in

373
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:33,370
which we can reduce power in these

374
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:36,789
facilities right by changing out

375
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:41,379
lighting yeah so LED lighting is has

376
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:44,769
made a tremendous growth in in the

377
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:46,958
industry in terms of the the type of

378
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:50,649
lighting that's being produced today

379
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:53,349
right and and so we can see tremendous

380
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:55,059
drops in load thirty to thirty to forty

381
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,069
percent in just your lighting load and

382
00:16:55,059 --> 00:17:00,239
then the air conditioning load drops on

383
00:16:57,068 --> 00:17:03,549
Ross as well and and so we're seeing

384
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,849
savings of roughly forty to fifty

385
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:08,678
percent total savings of the lighting

386
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:11,558
and interactive effects on the

387
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,699
air-conditioning system yes oh and we

388
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,009
know that there's we know that that's

389
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:18,400
that adoption rate is slow right because

390
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:19,900
because nationally and globally it's

391
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,480
been this industry has been indoor

392
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,909
indoor cannabis grow has been dominated

393
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,980
by high pressure sodium right well the

394
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:30,130
whole agricultural industry has been

395
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,460
dominated by high pressure sodium and so

396
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,610
it's you know when you talk about

397
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:39,069
controlled environment agriculture

398
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:43,750
covering the gamut of crops it's it's

399
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:46,490
the same issue the same issue yeah

400
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,308
so what what is so is there is there a

401
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,630
is there a line that you know Southern

402
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:52,190
California Edison has for the for the

403
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,410
inner grow for the inner grow industry

404
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,210
relative to their position is it just is

405
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,950
it a is it a general push to support the

406
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,419
state's policy or is there any specific

407
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:04,340
things that you would tell growers or

408
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:07,070
that you do tell growers yeah well are

409
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:11,389
pushing in with growers is to try and

410
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:13,189
drive them towards led yeah lighting and

411
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,820
more efficient air-conditioning systems

412
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:20,600
so we would love to see them get into a

413
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:23,928
chilled water system but the the the

414
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:27,379
biggest problem with most cultivators is

415
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:31,370
initial cost and the lack of lack of

416
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,500
available capital and so that's one of

417
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:35,389
the factors that we try to offset within

418
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,099
Central District Fire chiller like to

419
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,590
fire chilled water like yeah electric

420
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:42,709
shield chilled water right with LED

421
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:44,509
light right but uptake on that idea has

422
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,470
gonna take a long time for people to

423
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:47,750
really understand well what does that

424
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,730
mean to me as a grower right what does

425
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:52,339
that mean to my operation if I'm working

426
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:55,490
with you know a set of Goodman five tons

427
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:59,209
right now and and some quest D Huez and

428
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,650
you know a set of kavita's what is my

429
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,579
grow environment gonna be like how's it

430
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,669
gonna perform

431
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:06,500
so they've got issues right they've got

432
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:08,720
KPIs they've got responsibilities to

433
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,069
stakeholders they've got quotas to me

434
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,950
right exactly

435
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:17,418
so there's education education testing

436
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:20,900
there's there's there's yeah so we just

437
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:22,669
data we need and so that's one of the

438
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:27,460
things that we're doing is we're

439
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:31,210
supporting engineering studies and

440
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:34,610
providing LED lights where we can

441
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:37,519
operate to grow rooms side by side with

442
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:41,029
different technologies and gather that

443
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:43,879
data and and show that you know we

444
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:47,000
understand the the key components are

445
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,799
quality and yield and so what we're

446
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,349
looking for is to be able to show that

447
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,418
with with the right lights you can get

448
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:54,449
the right you can get the increase in

449
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:56,310
yield or the

450
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,620
equivalent yield and and the equivalent

451
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:01,559
were there any are there any TV spots

452
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:03,959
that we're gonna spec to see on cable

453
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,730
networks for the way we the way you know

454
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,380
the way we were the way we were educated

455
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,839
about you know compact fluorescents in

456
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,000
the home are we gonna see you know TV

457
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,159
spots - aimed at the grow at the grow

458
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,289
community - sort of you know how is the

459
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,180
outreach which what shapes the outreach

460
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:22,139
takers yeah so right now the outreach is

461
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:24,630
is the the organization part of the

462
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,880
organization that I'm in is a customer

463
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,790
outreach organization and we go out and

464
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,210
talk with the the growers and there are

465
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:35,759
groups and talk to them about what the

466
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:39,870
opportunities are and what the studies

467
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:43,980
are showing and work with them and try

468
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:46,859
and convince them to to make the

469
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,079
investment in LEDs and and we support

470
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:53,369
that again with incentives so that we

471
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:57,720
can help offset some of that that cost

472
00:20:53,369 --> 00:21:03,029
to the incremental cost I have a

473
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:06,299
question so specific I guess - like

474
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:08,519
Desert Hot Springs in in that area I

475
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:11,099
know that people have spent a lot of

476
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:13,400
money investment in enlarged buildings

477
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:16,500
and large operations out there and

478
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:20,430
they're under pressure now so when you

479
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,190
go and you talk to them do you do they

480
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,960
give you sob stories do they come you

481
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,410
know they are they under like economic

482
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,779
pressure and and that that might

483
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,700
mitigate their ability to put some of

484
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,829
these reforms into place and do they

485
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:38,880
talk to you about that yes so in the

486
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:43,049
cannabis industry in particular we know

487
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,880
that there under cost pressures we saw

488
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:47,129
basically we looked at at the other

489
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,510
markets Colorado Washington Oregon we

490
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:53,130
saw what happened there where there was

491
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:56,640
the the prices started to drop down

492
00:21:53,130 --> 00:22:00,150
because it became a lot more supply

493
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:04,380
and so we recognize that the the

494
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:06,120
financial implications of that we don't

495
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,600
get a lot of those sob stories so much

496
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,979
but because the growers just aren't

497
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,529
sharing those but we know that that's

498
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,660
happening and we know that the the lack

499
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:18,869
of access to capital is a big issue

500
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:22,019
aren't real estate prices also falling

501
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:24,929
out there do you know I don't know but I

502
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,819
believe that is true yeah yeah which

503
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:30,170
which might also mitigate their

504
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:33,000
willingness to you know make capital

505
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,170
improvements on on you know operations

506
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,450
that they don't even know they're gonna

507
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:40,440
be able to hold on to I mean it's just a

508
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:42,150
tough situation I would think so due

509
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,730
diligence I mean I would put that I

510
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,470
would put a lot of the four new

511
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:50,640
operations let's say not for existing

512
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:52,230
operation but for new operations those

513
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,090
are the elements that need to be

514
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,829
evaluated early when in the planning

515
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:57,480
process when looking at availability

516
00:22:55,829 --> 00:23:00,210
power when looking at real estate price

517
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,970
when looking at Finance and capital you

518
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:06,240
want to balance what you what we tell

519
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:10,370
our investors were capable of producing

520
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,380
so that it's a realistic number and that

521
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:16,679
it takes into account real estate price

522
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:22,170
upgrade price power availability time to

523
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:23,910
market labor costs I think what if so

524
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:27,300
I'm seeing that is if the picture can be

525
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:29,040
so with that that what did you call it

526
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,349
the the sob story or the heartbreak

527
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,359
story right now when those come out it's

528
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:36,119
usually result of there's a mismatch

529
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,609
between what the investor wants back at

530
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,439
the end of the month and what and the

531
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:43,740
rock and the hard place that that that

532
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,750
that the growers is cultivators is

533
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,940
pushed into and they might have had

534
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,710
expectations for the market that didn't

535
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,450
didn't pan out yeah or that or the

536
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,100
municipality may have changed their mind

537
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,830
lo and behold a municipality could

538
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:58,559
change their mind and you now wait a

539
00:23:55,829 --> 00:24:01,169
year in extra year so yeah plan plan

540
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,940
plan I mean so one of the things that we

541
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:05,940
always tell them when we're when we go

542
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,170
out and talk to our customers is you

543
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,240
know

544
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,430
the the opportunities that we're

545
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,400
identifying for them to become more

546
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:15,080
energy-efficient is an opportunity we're

547
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,150
trying to help them stay in business so

548
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:20,470
we're trying to help them lower their

549
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:24,320
energy costs which are there the major

550
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:26,809
non-personnel costs of the facility and

551
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,669
lower that operating cost down so that

552
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:30,799
they can stay in business and and make a

553
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,630
profit absolutely and it occurs to me

554
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,409
that these conversations should probably

555
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:40,310
be taking place before a shovel or pick

556
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:42,620
ever hits the ground absolutely exactly

557
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:44,509
yeah it's like exactly we can work

558
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:46,129
together holy cow

559
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:48,170
who thought we could work together right

560
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:50,120
let's the exact about this in the

561
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,590
planning phase so that we don't get

562
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:54,139
between the rock and the hard place so

563
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:55,279
that these eventualities have been put

564
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,590
into place that part of the due

565
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,210
diligence the investors understands that

566
00:24:57,589 --> 00:25:00,829
look there's two years to get power what

567
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,650
are we gonna do in those two years do we

568
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:06,289
just move elsewhere or do we take that

569
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,640
time to actually build a plan so that

570
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:09,500
when we're ready we're up and running in

571
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,420
a way that's sustainable yeah and the

572
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,829
other side of that is if we start this

573
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:18,529
conversation upfront we can help decide

574
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:20,899
where you locate because we can tell you

575
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:23,569
if there's capacity available on the

576
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,070
grid for where you're at and and if

577
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:28,099
you're if there's capacity then it's a

578
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:29,389
lot easier to get you the the power that

579
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:31,849
you need and that's a mind that's a

580
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,620
mindset shift are you gonna say where

581
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:37,269
are you seeing a lot of new facilities

582
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:39,769
popping up like are you seeing trends

583
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:41,839
well there's still a lot of growth going

584
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:43,400
on out in in Desert Hot Springs but

585
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:47,629
those are facilities that essentially

586
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:49,190
been in in the process for mostly two to

587
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,880
three years but they're still expanding

588
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,289
theirs

589
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,910
well they're they're going in the way

590
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:54,680
that they were they're coming online

591
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,410
yeah

592
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,269
and they're still probably a year or so

593
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,920
out from actually being it what's the

594
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:02,119
pipeline looking like right there are

595
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,700
there new are there new a new

596
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:06,199
applications coming into that pipeline

597
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,480
there are new applications coming in but

598
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,250
more of them are coming in I think in

599
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,230
the urban areas which is what we're

600
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,539
trying to do we're trying to one

601
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,880
specifically

602
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:18,369
with German Aryans well the largest

603
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,630
urban area right now is is Long Beach

604
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:23,769
okay

605
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:27,520
for us in terms of energy applications

606
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:31,720
of applications coming in or in terms of

607
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:33,970
businesses that are already there the

608
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:38,679
the next coming up one is probably in

609
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:42,490
the the lancaster palmdale area we have

610
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:44,679
a lot going on in Atlanta right now and

611
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,819
those are some of them are new and some

612
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:50,860
of them are have been in the pipeline

613
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:52,990
for a while so you know we've been

614
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:56,349
working pretty hard pretty diligently to

615
00:26:52,990 --> 00:27:00,308
to get power to the the Business Park

616
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:03,668
that is out in Atlanta to satisfy them

617
00:27:00,308 --> 00:27:05,980
so there's you know nationally there's

618
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:09,580
really three three huge issues that face

619
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:13,150
any indoor growing farmer it's available

620
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:15,308
capital its state licensing and its

621
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,720
municipal entitlements so your local

622
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:18,519
Planning Board but what we're adding

623
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,100
here is this third right if there's a

624
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:23,500
two-year wait time to get power to your

625
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:25,629
facility we're adding a fourth major

626
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,880
earn 'el just starting a business or to

627
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,250
continue in two years come from is that

628
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:34,870
is that an accurate wait time two years

629
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:36,130
it's project specific but we were

630
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:41,168
talking about this a little bit earlier

631
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:43,750
the the utility plans the changes to the

632
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:45,910
grid on a 10-year cycle it takes it

633
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:49,440
because depending on what it is if it's

634
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:53,290
a relocation of a distribution line then

635
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,120
the the it only takes us a year maybe

636
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:58,329
two years to relocate a distribution

637
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:00,099
line to get power if it's putting in a

638
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:03,879
new distribution line it's two to three

639
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:06,009
years if it's upgrading a substation to

640
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,620
get more capacity there it could be

641
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:10,619
three to five but if it's a new

642
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,429
transmission line that that's required

643
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:18,369
then it could be seven to ten years you

644
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:22,090
know I have a question when the state

645
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:25,489
propagated its rules and created its

646
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:28,009
strategy for the state its patchwork

647
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:32,480
strategy of rolling out and everything

648
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:36,200
did it come and consult with you was how

649
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,538
these businesses how these areas and

650
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,279
obviously they way they did it it was

651
00:28:38,538 --> 00:28:43,038
inevitable that certain parts of the

652
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:45,558
state would have more businesses than

653
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:50,779
others and probably be overloaded was so

654
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:53,029
was the energy component on their agenda

655
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:56,869
well no the state didn't consider that

656
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:59,808
at all and and because the state wasn't

657
00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:02,779
telling people where to go right they're

658
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:06,408
not telling people to go to any more

659
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:10,369
reason so when we when proposition 64

660
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:11,960
passed it basically said it's legal in

661
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:14,928
the state of California and then the

662
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,529
state said they left it up to the

663
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:21,288
individual municipalities and counties

664
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:23,750
to decide whether or not they wanted to

665
00:29:21,288 --> 00:29:26,089
allow it or not okay and so what so

666
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:28,849
what's what's what's basically happened

667
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:32,569
is the the disadvantaged communities

668
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:36,619
that don't have a lot of resources a lot

669
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:40,808
of capital coming in they're more open

670
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:43,099
to having new industries come in and so

671
00:29:40,808 --> 00:29:45,259
they're the ones that initially passed

672
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:50,298
and the ordinances and said yeah you can

673
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:51,859
come in and grow here he's not

674
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:53,929
coordinated that's that's when they

675
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:57,969
didn't coordinate because and and we've

676
00:29:53,929 --> 00:30:00,798
since worked on that with our local

677
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:03,079
public affairs people to go out and talk

678
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:07,089
with these communities say look before

679
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:11,359
you start accepting applications and

680
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:12,829
setting up business parks you come talk

681
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,558
to us and let's talk about what the

682
00:30:12,829 --> 00:30:18,889
capacity is there before you you start

683
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:20,079
taking applications so when we talk

684
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,269
about the

685
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,599
communities that are hardest hit for us

686
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:28,839
in terms of capacity you know we've got

687
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:32,379
Adelanto in California City and Desert

688
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:34,720
Hot Springs or the Coachella Valley that

689
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,100
was all done before they made those

690
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,100
decisions before they came and talked to

691
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:42,369
us and so we've got a real problem in

692
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:43,719
trying to meet that demand we're doing

693
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:46,389
our best to do that and it works through

694
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,399
the process but again some of it you

695
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,929
know is going to be 7 to 10 years if we

696
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:55,028
have to put a new transmission line in

697
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:57,850
and and so what we've done since then is

698
00:30:55,028 --> 00:31:00,849
is you know this all caught us a little

699
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:02,408
bit off guard we had you know in our

700
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:06,129
planning cycle we had no clue that this

701
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:09,510
was coming and so we didn't plan for it

702
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:12,730
now we're out talking to communities and

703
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:15,429
the different organizations and saying

704
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,679
hey look if you're going to come let's

705
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:20,740
talk first and you know let's work

706
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,740
together to provide still think the

707
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:26,048
state has a had a responsibility to

708
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,240
communicate what these smaller

709
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:29,859
municipalities we're going to face in

710
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,359
terms of being able to provide the

711
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:36,158
energy and the power to these businesses

712
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,918
knowing the timeline that you guys are

713
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,269
under you know right I don't think I

714
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:43,509
just don't think anybody ever thought

715
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:45,909
about it they didn't really think well

716
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:50,710
that's interesting in a state where are

717
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:52,659
there like 13 different sequa areas in

718
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,970
this a so you know the flip side is

719
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:59,669
they're very environmentally conscious

720
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:04,389
but energy is I mean tied inexorably to

721
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:05,990
right environment yes so it doesn't

722
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:07,879
really add up

723
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,190
we've been here for three days we're

724
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,380
kind of like some energy and power

725
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,750
related sites that you get out so that

726
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:17,419
would be greater like like what's what's

727
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:19,519
like wonder take away energy related

728
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:25,549
conversations you've had this past two

729
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:27,288
days or yeah you know it was this last

730
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:29,389
session here I was listening to and what

731
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:30,798
really witch's farms of the future there

732
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,840
was two sessions farms in the future one

733
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:37,519
farm with future two and and both were

734
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:39,678
populated by both urban and and and you

735
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,009
know Kentucky in various locations

736
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,840
nationally folks focused on the leafy

737
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:48,710
green and small and small vegetable

738
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:49,819
markets and and I noticed one distinct

739
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,610
difference was the language that they

740
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:54,470
used right talking about these as farms

741
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:56,449
talking about the the their grow

742
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,120
environment as a bot as a as a as a

743
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,429
biosphere talking about their their

744
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,829
total growth area in terms of acreage

745
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:07,580
these are all terms that can be

746
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:08,960
understood by a farmer right meaning

747
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:11,240
specifically his son grown suppose we

748
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,769
son grown work we understand labor we

749
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,399
understand we understand acreage we

750
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:19,339
understand biodome biosphere and I was I

751
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:21,889
was struck by how that leafy green

752
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:23,599
industry is is speaks with ease about

753
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,909
the same we're using the same language

754
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,849
around their indoor grows fully indoor

755
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:30,320
grows but in the cannabis industry we

756
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:32,959
still call it the cannabis industry we

757
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,428
don't call it necessarily farming we

758
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,890
talk about in terms of square feet and

759
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:41,059
canopy we talk about you know watts per

760
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:42,559
square foot and we seem to be it sounds

761
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:45,950
like if we started to share language

762
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,960
that with with farming and with big AG

763
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,340
that there might be some more

764
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,870
cross-pollination I think that was a

765
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:53,119
real takeaway that I heard that we could

766
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:54,619
we might have even I mean it's rapidly

767
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,719
changing right now this cannabis

768
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:58,639
industry changes fast but the idea that

769
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,710
we could even adopt more innovations

770
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,179
more quickly if we shared more

771
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,730
information with the at with the with

772
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:07,700
the AG community right right

773
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:11,358
the one thing that struck me is is that

774
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:14,148
you know the the the AG community that's

775
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,348
out there today is they're very

776
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:17,628
knowledgeable about what their

777
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:20,260
requirements are and how they get from

778
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:23,179
here to there with the new technologies

779
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:26,659
and they understand that much more so

780
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:30,338
than the cannabis industries and and so

781
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:33,378
I think a lot of a lot of it goes to

782
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:35,659
education and educating the cannabis

783
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:37,460
industry and bringing them trying to

784
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,858
draw them into that agricultural

785
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,929
community and and give them that

786
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:43,909
knowledge base that they're lacking

787
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:46,010
right now many of them don't know what

788
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:49,039
their requirements are another takeaway

789
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:52,549
was so RI is one of the co-sponsors here

790
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,719
and I sat on their panel yesterday not

791
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,489
sat on their panel the way that they did

792
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:58,279
a breakout session and they really

793
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:01,669
brought together HVAC issues lighting

794
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,980
issues utility issues and policy issues

795
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,809
and looking at that and saying look all

796
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,670
of all you all got to talk to each other

797
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:08,869
all y'all got to talk to within your

798
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,358
within your discipline within the

799
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:12,769
lighting discipline but then let's get

800
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,449
the lighting folks to talk to the policy

801
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:15,858
folks let's get the utility to talk to

802
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:18,078
the growers I think those are really

803
00:35:15,858 --> 00:35:19,489
powerful conversations what were

804
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,630
somebody two takeaways for you and then

805
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:28,039
yeah I again it goes back to the

806
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:30,108
educational process you know I think

807
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:31,699
getting getting the growers more

808
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:34,279
involved in in that whole process

809
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:35,689
because we talk a lot with the the

810
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,750
lighting manufacturers and HVAC

811
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:41,179
manufacturers and you know so we have

812
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:43,429
that relationship going and I think it's

813
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:46,848
drawing in the the growers into that

814
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:48,798
conversation that's really important do

815
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:50,809
you think growers at every scale I mean

816
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:52,009
there were some large-scale growers here

817
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:56,290
I don't know if there were too many

818
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:56,290
small or you know I didn't see anything

819
00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:01,759
yeah it's I mean it's really important

820
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:03,739
because the growers that I've run into

821
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,920
the ones that are growing on a smaller

822
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:09,618
scale

823
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,568
they they're growing by rote yeah you

824
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:13,670
know it's it's not necessarily that they

825
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:16,338
know all the science behind it but

826
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,539
they've learned the technique and that's

827
00:36:16,338 --> 00:36:20,239
one of the reasons that they are

828
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:22,039
reluctant to change technologies is

829
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,568
because if you change the technology you

830
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:26,059
change something something in the

831
00:36:23,568 --> 00:36:28,670
formula you need to be able to tell them

832
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:30,950
teach them what the the what other

833
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:33,940
components have to now change to to make

834
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:35,929
the same yield and same quality and

835
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,789
because they most of them don't know

836
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:39,798
that great and they don't have the

837
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:41,599
knowledge to do what is figuring out all

838
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:43,338
right so there's the tech part of it

839
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,780
then there's what about finance what

840
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:46,699
about the financial side of that so

841
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,280
rebates are a big great yeah and

842
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:51,078
understanding right so there's the

843
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,880
technology piece there's the there's the

844
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:54,048
adaptation of an existing grow that's

845
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,180
going to take some time we talked about

846
00:36:54,048 --> 00:36:57,920
that right but what about the carrot the

847
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:59,929
stick thing right they are there are

848
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,639
their real financial incentives that

849
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:03,710
need to be communicated to growers at

850
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:06,108
certain scales like I one takeaway for

851
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:09,409
me was a growers at a large scale do

852
00:37:06,108 --> 00:37:11,119
don't always have excuse me

853
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:13,608
growers and a large scale often have

854
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,858
more patient investors growers at

855
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:18,078
smaller scales often have impatient

856
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:19,940
investors and so that's that's another

857
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,369
rock in a hard place like how do you

858
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,889
satisfy the the investor who wants his

859
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:27,980
return tomorrow with the time it takes

860
00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:30,409
to wait for power adaptors grow between

861
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,088
an HPS light and an LED light understand

862
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:34,399
those differences and now bring in the

863
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:36,108
technologies that allow him to benefit

864
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,849
and allow that plant to work right I

865
00:37:36,108 --> 00:37:39,619
mean that's one of the differences that

866
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:43,160
that we heard over the last couple of

867
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:47,079
days the larger growers a lot larger

868
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:49,608
agricultural companies are looking at

869
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,849
paybacks in the five to seven years

870
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:54,469
period the in the smaller grower and the

871
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:55,760
cannabis industry is looking at a

872
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:57,649
two-year payback

873
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,650
you know because their business plan is

874
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:03,798
get in get out in five years and and be

875
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:07,760
done and either be it acquired or or

876
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:11,139
some other sell the business but

877
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,390
shouldn't that shorter payback allow

878
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:17,598
better a technology adaptation shouldn't

879
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:21,920
that quicker payback allow if the

880
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,510
resources are they should look at didn't

881
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,519
say what I'm gonna pay that back in two

882
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,960
years why wouldn't I adopt that new

883
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,940
technology like yeah so it takes a

884
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,889
different investor we're looking for

885
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,599
here - no but it doesn't that's that's

886
00:38:30,889 --> 00:38:35,420
one of the things one of the the issues

887
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:37,220
that we run into is that you know the

888
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,200
the paybacks on these new technologies

889
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:44,058
are typically under three to five year

890
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:47,868
range and so my challenge and in terms

891
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:49,579
of incentivizing is to try and and

892
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,039
incentivize them enough that it gets

893
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:55,220
that payback down to two years or or

894
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:57,770
less and and that's not always possible

895
00:38:55,219 --> 00:39:01,279
it's always based on the the amount of

896
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:05,739
savings that they can generate and the

897
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:09,260
smaller let me see the larger the

898
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:13,788
cultivation facility the easier it is to

899
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:17,150
to get enough savings that'll bring

900
00:39:13,789 --> 00:39:21,589
those costs down so we have a lot of

901
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:24,798
smaller growers who aren't large enough

902
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:27,380
to have the generate the electrical

903
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:29,269
savings that would then be incentivized

904
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,519
to bring that cost down what's your

905
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:34,400
definition of a small grower when you

906
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:38,019
say small grower what's nice farming or

907
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,338
we are we are you have in your mind I

908
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:42,380
would say anything that's under ten

909
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:44,599
thousand square feet you got you know

910
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,548
ten thousand gross square feet canopy

911
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,829
yeah well if talking canopy it's

912
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:51,650
probably five or six thousand square

913
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:54,829
feet can it okay okay gross facility

914
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:56,869
sizes 10 K yeah 20 K and you cannot be

915
00:39:54,829 --> 00:40:02,990
in that sort of six to eight K yeah okay

916
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:04,970
yep operation but that's still in the

917
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:06,828
scheme of things right here to lettuce

918
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:08,509
you know you're not a KERS we're talking

919
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:10,220
right first forty four thousand square

920
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:14,539
feet in an acre that would be a lot of

921
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:16,669
canopy yeah so you know it's and and

922
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:17,880
that's pretty much of the the average

923
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,340
size of

924
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:25,860
growing in our territory in particular

925
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:27,870
is about 10,000 square feet extend north

926
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,750
into Northern California where their

927
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:34,199
terrain is so different from obviously

928
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,670
the desert and maybe even down here we

929
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:39,269
don't go into Northern California so

930
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:41,610
much but it's yeah we we cover so on the

931
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:44,130
on the coast we cover up to about Santa

932
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:47,160
Barbara Goleta area in the Central

933
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:51,269
Valley we cover up to the most northern

934
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:54,929
place is count called wood lake which is

935
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:57,480
just north of to Larry's your so you're

936
00:40:54,929 --> 00:41:01,230
not really on a massive scale dealing

937
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:05,820
with altitude with with with farms that

938
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:08,789
are remote or you know high up or in you

939
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,710
know difficult environments or on or

940
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:14,670
that yeah well yeah I mean we have

941
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:17,760
there's we have farms in Tehachapi for

942
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:20,700
example which is a on higher elevation

943
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,250
gets snow so I guess my question is do

944
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:27,779
those present special challenges

945
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:31,019
energy-wise or for what you're doing so

946
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:35,040
in terms of having capacity out in those

947
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:37,019
areas they're they're typically it turns

948
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:44,639
out that where they're at there is is

949
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:46,349
capacity we have up on the on the east

950
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:49,259
side of this year as we go up as high as

951
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:53,000
Bridgeport we have some facilities in

952
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:58,080
Mammoth the mammoth area and there's

953
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:02,690
some Indian tribe tribal areas out there

954
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:06,150
that we we service those are pretty much

955
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:12,269
there they're smaller grows so that they

956
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:14,820
don't have the capacity issues so yeah

957
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:17,699
most yeah but do they still need to

958
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,170
become more efficient well I believe

959
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:20,519
absolutely if they want to stay in

960
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,809
business they're gonna have to become

961
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:26,188
more efficient

962
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:27,989
you know the the price of cannabis is

963
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:29,879
going to go down we know that

964
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:31,588
historically that's happened through all

965
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:37,099
the news to the north are experiencing

966
00:42:31,588 --> 00:42:37,099
it right now right now exactly yeah and

967
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:40,978
so if they're gonna stay in in business

968
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:42,239
they want to stay profitable they're

969
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:45,718
gonna have to cut their operating costs

970
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:48,228
and and so what about this discussion

971
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:50,699
then about way to cut operating costs is

972
00:42:48,228 --> 00:42:51,868
make a business decisions what what

973
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:54,269
you're growing and why what is your

974
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:55,890
customer actually consuming right and

975
00:42:54,268 --> 00:42:57,659
what is going to distil it and what is

976
00:42:55,889 --> 00:42:59,219
what is prized flower and saying can we

977
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:00,629
grow in our in where we are let's say

978
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:02,670
you're at elevation in this town you

979
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,229
mentioned and you're growing in a hoop

980
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,880
house or you're growing in a warehouse

981
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:07,649
and a pre engineer metal building is

982
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,298
there anything you could do outdoors to

983
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,920
increase your capacity as opposed to

984
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:12,809
building more indoor facility and is

985
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,028
that is that part of the planning

986
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:17,699
process of the cannabis company or is

987
00:43:15,028 --> 00:43:19,679
this is the municipality in California

988
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:22,920
limiting are they legislating against

989
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:27,419
outdoor grows are there where's that it

990
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:29,789
in the urban areas in particular the the

991
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:35,309
state regulations pretty much limit and

992
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:36,539
what you can yeah it's in there so

993
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:38,999
there's an area where we could use

994
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:40,829
better legislation right if this if the

995
00:43:38,998 --> 00:43:42,748
if the legislature wants to hit carbon

996
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:45,239
neutrality then don't force everything

997
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:47,009
indoors that's just the two don't work

998
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:50,309
because we're gonna consume a lot of

999
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:53,818
cannabis are those zoning issues or

1000
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:59,910
agricultural land outside in an urban

1001
00:43:53,818 --> 00:44:01,650
area what are the challenge was zoning

1002
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:04,649
but it also has to do with just the way

1003
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:06,709
the regulations were written you know

1004
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:09,959
the regulations were written such that

1005
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:13,259
the facility has to be secure so nobody

1006
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:16,078
can just break in and you get some of

1007
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:18,269
the product they had has to be invisible

1008
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,209
to the outside world it has to be there

1009
00:44:18,268 --> 00:44:22,798
has to be owner control so that each

1010
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:24,268
state each state is legislating that

1011
00:44:22,798 --> 00:44:26,400
differently and so one of the big newest

1012
00:44:24,268 --> 00:44:28,078
examples here is Illinois it is great

1013
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,959
come right coming online and we're just

1014
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,278
reading that law but in their

1015
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:33,179
legislation they are forbidding outdoor

1016
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:36,449
growing

1017
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:37,949
and for a new state coming online the

1018
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:39,960
size of Illinois with the population

1019
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:41,818
Illinois and with the growing season

1020
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,409
what can we grow outdoors in Illinois a

1021
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:44,788
lot of soybean lot of corn there's no

1022
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:47,190
there's no prohibition about growing

1023
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:49,170
outdoors right so why why limit the crop

1024
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,970
and why is the reason for that do you

1025
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:59,490
know I'm sure it's I'm sure it's stigma

1026
00:44:50,969 --> 00:45:02,159
it's also older stigma security who's

1027
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:04,108
out of sight keep it up yeah well we

1028
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:07,500
just went through that here in

1029
00:45:04,108 --> 00:45:10,078
California because the government moved

1030
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:15,088
hemp from the controlled substance list

1031
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:18,539
and so we have this year we had a lot of

1032
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:20,670
hemp grown outdoors and the the

1033
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:25,278
requirements for growing hemp are much

1034
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:29,548
less onerous than than cannabis and so

1035
00:45:25,278 --> 00:45:32,068
in Ventura County where I am based we

1036
00:45:29,548 --> 00:45:36,298
had about three thousand acres of hemp

1037
00:45:32,068 --> 00:45:41,699
grown a lot of it was grown in the urban

1038
00:45:36,298 --> 00:45:44,699
areas and after the first crop all of

1039
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:47,608
those communities have now since that

1040
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:50,608
we're having a moratorium on cannon hemp

1041
00:45:47,608 --> 00:45:54,420
because it's got the same scent as

1042
00:45:50,608 --> 00:45:57,630
cannabis and nobody wants it it's it's

1043
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,818
the odor issue colleague was talking

1044
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,079
about maybe just you know creating a

1045
00:45:59,818 --> 00:46:02,969
forum creating creating more

1046
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:04,470
opportunities to bring you know I like

1047
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:06,358
this concept of utility meat grower

1048
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:08,788
grower meat utility that's a really neat

1049
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:10,619
that's a productive one of the points I

1050
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:13,349
took away from the future of the farm

1051
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:15,028
was so there's these vertical farms from

1052
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:18,170
back east and there they were talking

1053
00:46:15,028 --> 00:46:21,510
about how they want to compete with

1054
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:23,159
California agriculture right and I'm

1055
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:25,109
like okay that sounds great but someone

1056
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:30,269
mentioned the other day with respect to

1057
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:34,288
cannabis Thailand producing at one penny

1058
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:36,659
a gram so really you know and I know

1059
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:39,180
people are already thinking globally

1060
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:40,949
especially larger operations but you

1061
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:42,419
know how do you compete with that

1062
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:44,189
now we don't know what they're you know

1063
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,289
processes they have in how

1064
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:50,309
how clean that crop is and how they're

1065
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:53,099
making it but one cent a gram so I mean

1066
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:55,140
it's one thing with your leafy

1067
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:57,480
vegetables in your Tomatoes but if

1068
00:46:55,139 --> 00:47:00,000
you're talking cannabis do you also want

1069
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,219
to think globally as well yeah you do

1070
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,829
and so one of the issues around that is

1071
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:06,959
is understanding the product and if we

1072
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:08,579
have decriminalization if we can de

1073
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,900
schedule cannabis from Schedule one at

1074
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:14,010
the Controlled Substances Act out of

1075
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:16,588
five now the FDA can come in and may and

1076
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:18,210
and and may and manage what is the

1077
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:20,489
product and to whom is it being sold as

1078
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:23,849
being prescribed by a doctor if it is it

1079
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:26,129
must be you know C GMP certified or G

1080
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:28,470
ACP certified on the growth side and

1081
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:30,119
cGMP on the manufacturing side that's a

1082
00:47:28,469 --> 00:47:31,409
whole new set of regulations that we

1083
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,869
need to be that we need to prepare for

1084
00:47:31,409 --> 00:47:36,358
right so we need to understand what are

1085
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:37,650
we growing for and we're an industry

1086
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:39,269
that's we just talked about the

1087
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,680
municipalities and how difficult they

1088
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:41,880
are the state and how difficult that is

1089
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:44,219
now we're going to add federal

1090
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,750
regulation to that mix and we need to be

1091
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:47,939
prepared for that we need to understand

1092
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:50,670
that our facilities are regulated at

1093
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,470
those three levels yeah that's true yeah

1094
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:55,289
I mean for the last three years they've

1095
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:57,209
been warning okay that the FDA is coming

1096
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,700
yeah you know yeah it's coming and with

1097
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:02,940
it and that will touch every aspect of

1098
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:04,469
cannabis every no no overall they'd be

1099
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,119
different verticals you either be a

1100
00:48:04,469 --> 00:48:09,379
medicinal verb that's right hemp

1101
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:12,240
verticals right and don't use vertical

1102
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:14,789
we're projecting that that would be

1103
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:17,848
controlled by the TTB the taxation and

1104
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:19,380
trade Bureau because it is not going to

1105
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:21,778
be a product that is prescribed by a

1106
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,829
doctor you're gonna have to have you

1107
00:48:21,778 --> 00:48:24,358
know you can just have to follow and if

1108
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:27,869
it's gonna but if you're gonna sell in

1109
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:29,909
you know marijuana infused products then

1110
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:31,769
that is consumed orally that's taken

1111
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:34,679
internally that you have to do that in

1112
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:36,659
food safe situations right so it's very

1113
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:38,368
similar to it's the food and drug

1114
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:40,019
industry and I think that's we've talked

1115
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:41,880
my language earlier changing language

1116
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:43,409
about what what industry were in we're

1117
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,849
in the food and drug industry right we

1118
00:48:43,409 --> 00:48:46,558
are drug which is a drug manufacturing

1119
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:49,109
industry we need to produce drugs that

1120
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,400
are consistent every time it is

1121
00:48:49,108 --> 00:48:54,380
consistent so that when the customer

1122
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,260
comes and buys it it is exactly the same

1123
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:59,510
you know I've interviewed large written

1124
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,670
articles about large cannabis companies

1125
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:03,620
where the owners came out of the food

1126
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:05,240
industry yeah in a big way they were

1127
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:06,769
they were established in the food

1128
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:10,039
industry and these are established

1129
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:12,019
cannabis companies from Colorado a

1130
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:15,139
couple of them and it was very

1131
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:17,809
interesting to interview these these

1132
00:49:15,139 --> 00:49:19,730
CEOs these executives because their

1133
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:23,920
outlook about everything was so

1134
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:26,900
different they they had so little

1135
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,570
patience for the cannabis regulators

1136
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:32,690
because so many of these issues they

1137
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:35,710
said we've already solved them you know

1138
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:38,450
a day really in the food industry okay

1139
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:43,940
you know as foodies they were foodies

1140
00:49:38,449 --> 00:49:45,859
you know and you know so but they would

1141
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,809
you know they would work very closely

1142
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,670
you know and these are people who like

1143
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:52,849
eight ten years ago were set set up

1144
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:54,800
their kitchens in in Colorado and then

1145
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:56,839
the regulator's would come in no nothing

1146
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,550
they wouldn't know what was the right

1147
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:01,390
standards or what to do for setting up

1148
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:03,920
so they were teaching them so that

1149
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:07,519
relationship with those local regulators

1150
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:10,460
is a decade old yes yeah and that has to

1151
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:12,769
count for something it does when the FDA

1152
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,480
comes in because one because and this

1153
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:15,980
this is another thought I had if this

1154
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,130
because someone I talked about how they

1155
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:21,349
were developing regulations at a local

1156
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:23,240
or state level and my what I was

1157
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:25,759
wondering was okay well when the federal

1158
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:27,589
come when in that research when the

1159
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,510
federal government comes in will they

1160
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:32,090
use that data will they use that

1161
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:34,340
research so that we don't have to go

1162
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:36,530
back and start at square one

1163
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:38,390
right they really should I mean there is

1164
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:41,240
actually a lot of data this is one of

1165
00:50:38,389 --> 00:50:44,829
those data intense industries there is I

1166
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:47,719
I've been covering it now since 2015 and

1167
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:49,090
there's more data in this industry than

1168
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:51,679
practice and it's extremely

1169
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:53,660
technologically advanced industry except

1170
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:57,349
that so much of that data is in silos

1171
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:59,480
yeah yeah not share so GM so GMP

1172
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:01,400
certification and communicating that to

1173
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,818
governed officials is about

1174
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,579
record-keeping

1175
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:08,188
the fundamental idea of cGMP is

1176
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:11,160
record-keeping it's being able to report

1177
00:51:08,188 --> 00:51:12,328
on the spot when somebody shows up a

1178
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:13,949
knocks on the door and said we're here

1179
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:17,429
to inspect you and you've got the

1180
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:19,079
records you so that so data is gonna

1181
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:22,410
read data data drives everything in our

1182
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:23,640
world having it readily accessible it

1183
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:25,588
you know it can't just be written in

1184
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:27,208
pencil on a spiral bound notebook with

1185
00:51:25,588 --> 00:51:29,188
dog ears it's got to be you know

1186
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:31,078
electronic recorded pull up at an

1187
00:51:29,188 --> 00:51:33,719
instant and ready to ready to transmit

1188
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,119
to the to whoever shows up that kind of

1189
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:37,739
data means you know this is a really

1190
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,689
great point I've been to a whole number

1191
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:41,009
of grows from Washington State through

1192
00:51:39,688 --> 00:51:43,588
this one and you go and they're all

1193
00:51:41,009 --> 00:51:45,059
different some of them are run even if

1194
00:51:43,588 --> 00:51:47,009
they're large operations are pretty much

1195
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:49,349
run on notebooks everything's written by

1196
00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:52,409
the door written down is manual others

1197
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:54,539
are all electronic and digitized can you

1198
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:57,178
speak to that a little bit the variety

1199
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:59,039
of operations and technology and

1200
00:51:57,179 --> 00:52:01,168
sophistication that you've seen yeah

1201
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:06,778
well I've seen that the gamut in our

1202
00:52:01,168 --> 00:52:11,998
territory I I've seen some that were

1203
00:52:06,778 --> 00:52:14,789
literally run off a notebook and others

1204
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:18,598
are what I consider you know top of the

1205
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:22,469
line we have there's a grow that I know

1206
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:25,499
that is operated by a person who came

1207
00:52:22,469 --> 00:52:29,088
out of the the pharmaceutical industry

1208
00:52:25,498 --> 00:52:32,759
and so everything is done

1209
00:52:29,088 --> 00:52:34,528
Six Sigma you know and its controls on

1210
00:52:32,759 --> 00:52:36,599
everything how do we not leave people

1211
00:52:34,528 --> 00:52:38,009
behind right how do we how do we bring

1212
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:39,568
everybody up because we're because

1213
00:52:38,009 --> 00:52:41,219
there's incredibly sophisticated grows

1214
00:52:39,568 --> 00:52:44,009
that operate off a notebook but what

1215
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:46,650
we're saying here is what are the tools

1216
00:52:44,009 --> 00:52:47,039
to to to run to the tide rising all

1217
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,079
boats

1218
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,509
you know we don't want to lose our

1219
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:53,339
traditional growers our small craft

1220
00:52:51,509 --> 00:52:56,489
growers because they have knowledge and

1221
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:58,018
genetics that are invaluable we want we

1222
00:52:56,489 --> 00:52:59,639
don't want them to go away

1223
00:52:58,018 --> 00:53:01,708
right now so are they're teaming and I

1224
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:03,358
don't know they're teaming are there so

1225
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:05,098
with it one thing we suffer from as an

1226
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:07,889
industry is lack of shared information

1227
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:09,809
right so peer-reviewed journals would be

1228
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:11,478
a great thing so if we could get data

1229
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:14,369
written out peer reviewed and

1230
00:53:11,478 --> 00:53:15,679
distributed would be awesome right

1231
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:17,329
because nope

1232
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:18,529
because one of the lament he talked

1233
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:19,730
about the things that about the

1234
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:22,010
takeaways from this conference that

1235
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:24,230
maybe weren't so good we don't have

1236
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:26,150
enough growers here and because growers

1237
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,409
don't have time in their day to is why

1238
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:29,358
we're doing this you know while we're

1239
00:53:27,409 --> 00:53:31,489
doing this videocast so that we can

1240
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:32,779
reach people where they're at and if

1241
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:34,699
you've got time to listen to a podcast

1242
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,290
merge the title is with you know YouTube

1243
00:53:34,699 --> 00:53:38,419
channel maybe you could you know can

1244
00:53:36,289 --> 00:53:40,369
learn something and I think that's where

1245
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,720
it falls on folks

1246
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:43,760
you know professionals in the industry

1247
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:45,139
that how do we share that how do we how

1248
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,540
do we get that information out there to

1249
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:49,009
share it so that would rise all boats I

1250
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:51,019
think yeah this is like this type of

1251
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:54,230
conference is almost like a dull

1252
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:56,719
conference it's like oh uh you know this

1253
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:59,119
car you know at this this is such an

1254
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:02,000
important topic and yet it's been

1255
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,099
disregarded in a sense maybe taken for

1256
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,039
granted is that the attitude is energy

1257
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:09,410
taken for granted I think it is in a lot

1258
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,210
of cases you people are used to going to

1259
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:14,480
the light switch and and turning it on

1260
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:16,490
and and it's there you know and at home

1261
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,588
you never have to worry about capacity

1262
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:20,029
right rapid growth right we talked about

1263
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,798
how quit you know if the investor wants

1264
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:24,710
the you know it does not have the

1265
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:25,730
patience for due diligence then nobody's

1266
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:28,159
got the time to come and talk to

1267
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:29,539
Southern California Edison right now

1268
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:31,039
right and if you don't take the time to

1269
00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:33,289
do that then you don't understand that

1270
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:34,880
you're you could risk an enormous

1271
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:37,699
investment if you didn't because you get

1272
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,338
shut down or right so that that patience

1273
00:54:37,699 --> 00:54:43,039
aspect hasn't been established yet right

1274
00:54:40,338 --> 00:54:45,108
it's now now now now now so we need to

1275
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:47,150
slow down a little bit go slow to go

1276
00:54:45,108 --> 00:54:49,940
fast if you heard that go slow to go

1277
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:51,619
fast planning is not gonna slow you down

1278
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:53,900
planning is gonna speed you up so if you

1279
00:54:51,619 --> 00:54:55,460
do diligence is planning right meeting

1280
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,930
with the officials is planning and

1281
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,240
that's one of the things when I go out

1282
00:54:56,929 --> 00:55:01,159
and I do outreach with grower

1283
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:04,789
organizations that's one of the things

1284
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:08,118
that I try to to espouse to them is is

1285
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:10,849
that we need to have this this ongoing

1286
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:12,470
conversation so that when you're

1287
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:14,000
planning to do something let us know so

1288
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:16,939
we can help you achieve that

1289
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,489
so so now you've been to this particular

1290
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:21,559
conference which is really focused what

1291
00:55:19,489 --> 00:55:23,328
did anything happen here and and you

1292
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:25,160
know there's all these industries here

1293
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:26,230
and the industry is kind of focused here

1294
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:28,210
so is

1295
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:31,420
anything you're taking away or that you

1296
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:34,869
heard where you went um like inside Oh

1297
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:36,789
No oh we got to work on that this

1298
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:39,519
situation is like worse than I thought

1299
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:43,960
like have you learned or heard anything

1300
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:45,309
yeah we're yeah yeah okay yeah and it's

1301
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,650
it's kind of why I'm talking to you

1302
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:49,480
Gary's because you know I'm new to the

1303
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:51,240
California market not new to cannabis is

1304
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:54,699
new to California market and

1305
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:58,479
specifically oh this is worse than I

1306
00:55:54,699 --> 00:56:02,889
thought y'all been at this fort for

1307
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,539
20-something years and yet the what's

1308
00:56:02,889 --> 00:56:09,009
bad what's worse than you thought

1309
00:56:04,539 --> 00:56:11,858
the hodgepodge of municipal messed up

1310
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:12,190
nests here that is way worse than I

1311
00:56:11,858 --> 00:56:14,529
thought

1312
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:16,240
and from a so when I think about how do

1313
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:18,160
I add value to the conversation how does

1314
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,739
an architect come in and improve the

1315
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:23,289
situation beyond subject matter

1316
00:56:20,739 --> 00:56:24,608
expertise I need to know I need to know

1317
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:26,050
the utilities because I need to figure

1318
00:56:24,608 --> 00:56:27,789
out how to how do you match how do you

1319
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:30,090
met how do you knit this patchwork of

1320
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:32,590
completely disparate laws back together

1321
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:34,960
so we can talk about what what we can

1322
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:36,250
talk about things like best practices in

1323
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,070
the industry we can talk about things

1324
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:40,809
like the traffic cones which are the

1325
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:43,450
sort of standards within with within

1326
00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:45,070
which we operate you can do different

1327
00:56:43,449 --> 00:56:46,689
techniques within those but these are

1328
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:49,660
the standards like energy consumption

1329
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:52,780
water consumption building thermal

1330
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:55,389
envelope you know but now you add this

1331
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:59,290
difficulty of the patchwork of municipal

1332
00:56:55,389 --> 00:57:00,549
different in laws and that's this

1333
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:02,650
enormous that's a really big

1334
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:06,760
complication yeah that's worse than I

1335
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:08,858
thought you know we probably used to the

1336
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,420
patchwork I mean I'm here in California

1337
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:12,909
the whole time and so we've had to deal

1338
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,500
with this from you know see from and

1339
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:17,199
it's been a mess from the very beginning

1340
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:19,449
I'm wondering if the state regrets

1341
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,608
rolling it out that way and giving every

1342
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:25,480
municipality the choice because it's

1343
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:27,549
created havoc within this state yes yeah

1344
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:31,059
I have no no idea whether they do or not

1345
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:32,320
I know that they've they're going

1346
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:33,730
through some changes in the way that

1347
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,190
they're doing it yeah

1348
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:39,240
you know one of the biggest issues was

1349
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:43,300
the the the hope that you know by

1350
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:47,079
legalizing it that we would eventually

1351
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:49,570
work out the illicit market and one of

1352
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:53,409
the big issues that we we have is the

1353
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:56,050
taxation and you know by the time all is

1354
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:58,809
said and done the the product is taxed

1355
00:57:56,050 --> 00:58:01,740
you know basically 54:39 percent the

1356
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:04,809
other day at a shop which is you know

1357
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:06,369
for for someone who has their patient

1358
00:58:04,809 --> 00:58:08,739
card and all that that's that's

1359
00:58:06,369 --> 00:58:10,569
unacceptable but I told the regulator's

1360
00:58:08,739 --> 00:58:13,659
that I mean other than the politicians

1361
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:15,450
and you know um one of the cannabis

1362
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:17,500
Control Commission officers from

1363
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,889
Massachusetts is here for this

1364
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,889
conference

1365
00:58:17,889 --> 00:58:23,469
Doyle yeah and one of the things that

1366
00:58:20,889 --> 00:58:25,900
the state of mass does just as an

1367
00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:28,779
example is publishes a map of the state

1368
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,880
and all 360 plus or minus municipalities

1369
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,980
and you can read right from that website

1370
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,780
which municipality has voted for it

1371
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,940
which percentage of the vote who voted

1372
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,560
in that town so we had two votes like as

1373
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,170
you as you did too right we had a we had

1374
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,889
a we had a medical vote in 2012

1375
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:44,139
Massachusetts did they had they had a

1376
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:46,569
adult use of vote in 2018 and you can

1377
00:58:44,139 --> 00:58:47,859
read on the website who voted what was

1378
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:50,140
the percentage of vote is there a

1379
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:52,269
moratorium today when is that moratorium

1380
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:54,309
sundowning so as it so as an industry

1381
00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:56,110
the industry can look at that map and

1382
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:58,449
say well let's let's go to a town that

1383
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:59,829
is that is open so that that increases

1384
00:58:58,449 --> 00:59:02,829
planning so there's a world of the state

1385
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:04,719
plays did in that enables development

1386
00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:06,730
and that's a critical understanding is

1387
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:09,159
that the state can enable develop the

1388
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:12,039
state can help by just publishing data

1389
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:14,739
you know which sounds great that really

1390
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:16,840
sounds great I hope the Massachusetts

1391
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:19,239
now that I'm thinking about it also said

1392
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,760
oh we also need to make sure that if

1393
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:24,009
there's a gold rush or a green rush into

1394
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,530
one particular town or sector that they

1395
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:29,380
have the energy that you know to meet

1396
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:30,820
that and and and every state has to be

1397
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:34,660
the same they have to have a long

1398
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:37,059
timeline to make you know big changes so

1399
00:59:34,659 --> 00:59:39,460
there that's the same example it's like

1400
00:59:37,059 --> 00:59:41,380
that does sound great but you and then

1401
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:44,530
we realize that everything is connected

1402
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:47,110
you know and and

1403
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:49,330
can't move forward with large projects

1404
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:51,519
without empowering them and the very

1405
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:52,900
thought of putting a project into place

1406
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:55,659
and having to wait two years for your

1407
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:58,660
power is mind-boggling unless you

1408
00:59:55,659 --> 01:00:00,639
already have a two-year rollout you know

1409
00:59:58,659 --> 01:00:03,879
and then it's all you're gonna work for

1410
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:06,039
you yeah well and that goes back to it

1411
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:08,650
takes us a while to get the power why

1412
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:10,269
you need to get involved early and have

1413
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,880
us involved early into the planning

1414
01:00:10,269 --> 01:00:15,789
process the earlier we can get into it

1415
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,289
then we have a parallel path going well

1416
01:00:15,789 --> 01:00:19,480
that's an interesting thing writing we

1417
01:00:17,289 --> 01:00:20,679
talked about the earlier if you know

1418
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,469
you've got a two-year wait for your

1419
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:25,539
power this is you now haven't you ever

1420
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:27,339
give a mandate to go slow to go fast you

1421
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:28,630
simply can't go any faster than that so

1422
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:30,010
the question now is what are you gonna

1423
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:32,710
do how do you take advantage of those

1424
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:34,480
two years what do you do do you have a

1425
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:36,579
roadmap can we provide a roadmap for

1426
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,530
what needs to be set in place so when

1427
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:40,299
that two-year time is up you're ready to

1428
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:42,070
go theoretically that might be the best

1429
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,990
thing that ever happened to you in a way

1430
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:46,059
yeah because because because capital

1431
01:00:43,989 --> 01:00:48,759
capital can't push you any faster

1432
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:50,230
then then then the utility is able to

1433
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,910
provide that drug so that now I'm

1434
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,710
thinking so Desert Hot Springs which you

1435
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:55,569
spoke a lot about and I've been out

1436
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:58,269
there I was out there for when can

1437
01:00:55,570 --> 01:01:00,490
Desson launched their first two

1438
01:00:58,269 --> 01:01:02,949
buildings you know several years ago and

1439
01:01:00,489 --> 01:01:06,039
the city was there and they had a little

1440
01:01:02,949 --> 01:01:08,319
boy scout true I mean they really they

1441
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:10,539
really played this up and I have to say

1442
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:13,539
it was a small ceremony but it was

1443
01:01:10,539 --> 01:01:15,909
moving the mayor spoke and what this

1444
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:19,090
dirt what it meant to this dirt poor

1445
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:21,609
town it was moving to me I was genuinely

1446
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:25,030
moved because it was so real and so

1447
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:27,930
sincere a very poor City you know half

1448
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:31,240
an hour north of Palm Springs you know

1449
01:01:27,929 --> 01:01:34,210
you know and so all of that sounds so

1450
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:35,319
great but you know due diligence you

1451
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:36,970
know all this things so I guess my

1452
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:40,180
question is so that was several years

1453
01:01:36,969 --> 01:01:42,429
ago now these large places are coming

1454
01:01:40,179 --> 01:01:44,859
online so once they come online then

1455
01:01:42,429 --> 01:01:48,250
their power deeds don't they escalate

1456
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:50,110
and like America well well they do but

1457
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:51,489
they don't come online all at once and

1458
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,300
that's that's another part of the

1459
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:55,689
planning process

1460
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:56,560
so typically these these facilities are

1461
01:01:55,690 --> 01:02:01,030
coming on

1462
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:02,650
in phases and so if we know that in the

1463
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:03,280
year you can plan we can plan for that

1464
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:05,139
too

1465
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,700
and that's another reason why it's

1466
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:09,429
important for us to be involved in the

1467
01:02:06,699 --> 01:02:11,500
upfront so but specifically with the

1468
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:14,919
desert hot springs do you feel like

1469
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:16,360
right now that you know how the rollouts

1470
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,220
going to come and so you feel like

1471
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:21,579
you're in good shape to be able to meet

1472
01:02:18,219 --> 01:02:25,059
the needs I think we are I don't know

1473
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:26,500
the exact timeline on all of that but we

1474
01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:28,539
have a pretty good handle on what's

1475
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:32,590
going in and in that Coachella Valley

1476
01:02:28,539 --> 01:02:34,659
and what the requirements are and and

1477
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:36,700
we're building to do that raises a

1478
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:38,799
question is there any follow-on benefit

1479
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:42,009
that you from a utility perspective see

1480
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:43,570
from a large consumer customer coming in

1481
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:45,730
like a cannabis entity is there any

1482
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:47,950
follow-on benefit by providing that

1483
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:49,840
power for that for this industry

1484
01:02:47,949 --> 01:02:51,429
are there other it does that create

1485
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,900
opportunity for other businesses to move

1486
01:02:51,429 --> 01:02:55,599
into into Desert Hot Springs that

1487
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:58,990
weren't there before yeah support those

1488
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:01,119
industries it's possible seen it I

1489
01:02:58,989 --> 01:03:05,439
haven't seen it I know but it's possible

1490
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:07,630
because I'm just thinking if if if the

1491
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,460
economic drivers for for the cannabis

1492
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:12,400
industry for the food and drug industry

1493
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:14,920
are allowing entities out there to wait

1494
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,930
those two years there must be entities

1495
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,909
who don't have that time to wait and so

1496
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:20,379
wouldn't be wouldn't be lining up to

1497
01:03:18,909 --> 01:03:23,049
come in to Desert Hot Springs so that

1498
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:24,460
mayor that passionate occupy yeah he

1499
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:26,410
must be thinking of well this could

1500
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,389
actually spur further development no

1501
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:30,429
doubt that's what that is what they're

1502
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:32,949
thinking that yeah yeah they see a

1503
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:35,079
future finally we see a few just more

1504
01:03:32,949 --> 01:03:36,909
marijuana or drug drug manufacturers but

1505
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:39,759
the follow-on industries the other jobs

1506
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:41,769
if you create 200 jobs those people need

1507
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,540
a place to live those people need a

1508
01:03:41,769 --> 01:03:45,009
place to shop they need a place to get

1509
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:46,989
their car fixed right those are all

1510
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:48,880
follow ons that that are that are

1511
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:51,069
invisible but that absolutely did

1512
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,050
they're real I have a question for you

1513
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:55,539
just occurred Amman is probably specific

1514
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:57,760
to a state like California which has

1515
01:03:55,539 --> 01:04:02,440
this you know obviously the traditional

1516
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:04,030
cannabis market for four decades so and

1517
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,789
it's still out there it's still robust

1518
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:08,890
larger than the legal one they consume

1519
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:09,960
power to but there are probably people

1520
01:04:08,889 --> 01:04:12,000
that you have

1521
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,889
the difficulty of not impossibility

1522
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,989
having conversations with they don't

1523
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:17,940
want to talk to you they want to still

1524
01:04:15,989 --> 01:04:23,189
stay underneath so how do you account

1525
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:23,639
for that well we don't is the bottom

1526
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:30,539
line

1527
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:33,480
the we look one of the the challenges

1528
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:35,880
that I had when we're looking at state

1529
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:40,320
licenses for for cannabis gross

1530
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:43,320
they the the cannabis growers have one

1531
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:45,390
name for the state and when they get

1532
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:49,670
power from us it's a different name and

1533
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:53,009
so trying to correlate the two together

1534
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:54,990
the entity LLC I see what are they

1535
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:57,270
actually registered as who have they how

1536
01:04:54,989 --> 01:04:58,649
do they apply and what is the legal name

1537
01:04:57,269 --> 01:05:01,769
of the entity is it attached the

1538
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:05,250
property or they a tenant right and and

1539
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:07,320
so those that are in the illicit market

1540
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:09,960
as long as they're not stealing power

1541
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,700
from us we don't know what they're doing

1542
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,690
and we don't care what they're doing so

1543
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:16,250
as long as they're paying for their

1544
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:19,470
power it's and so they're there are

1545
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:25,079
entities within our territory that I

1546
01:05:19,469 --> 01:05:26,189
know or I'm sure are cultivating but we

1547
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:27,838
don't know that they're there and

1548
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:31,200
they're they're paying their bills on

1549
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:33,210
time and so and law enforcement still

1550
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:35,608
doing their thermal scanning from the

1551
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:38,300
skies over the state I mean I think you

1552
01:05:35,608 --> 01:05:40,739
know looking yeah for entered hot spots

1553
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:42,630
right but but we're not involved with

1554
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:46,469
that no you're not don't they let you

1555
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:50,430
know no we only react to that if we get

1556
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:52,409
subpoenaed to us you know we don't we

1557
01:05:50,429 --> 01:05:56,039
don't coordinate with the the

1558
01:05:52,409 --> 01:05:59,069
authorities you know we're not part of

1559
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:01,019
the the policing organization the only

1560
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:03,390
time that we get involved is if we

1561
01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:06,000
discover that there's power being stolen

1562
01:06:03,389 --> 01:06:09,509
and and then we get in you're required

1563
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,210
then obviously to do something but in

1564
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:14,339
terms of identifying where grow houses

1565
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:17,039
are or anything like that that's we

1566
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:18,900
don't have any any role in that at all

1567
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,179
it occurs to me that the the energy

1568
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:23,278
needs of the larger

1569
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:25,828
this community in California were

1570
01:06:23,278 --> 01:06:27,239
probably baked in a long time ago you

1571
01:06:25,829 --> 01:06:30,839
know I mean they've been at it for so

1572
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:33,479
long so you know we haven't gone we

1573
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:38,880
haven't had a blackout for that right

1574
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:40,949
yeah yeah you know we have although I

1575
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,250
don't have any statistics to go with it

1576
01:06:40,949 --> 01:06:46,858
I'm sure that we've had transformer

1577
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:51,750
issues and in certain areas that may

1578
01:06:46,858 --> 01:06:55,230
have been caused by grows but we don't

1579
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:57,380
have anything specific to to relate to

1580
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:57,380
that
