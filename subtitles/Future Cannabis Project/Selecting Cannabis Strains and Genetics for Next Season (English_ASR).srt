2
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:18,198
you know we're talking about more than

3
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,629
coveted the top shelf right now and

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,759
obviously thousands of different

5
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:24,829
cultivars and strains and sub strains

6
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:26,750
and cross threads and back breads and

7
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:28,729
all the rest of it how do you determine

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,189
like how do you know I mean we know some

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,700
trendy ones like Gorilla Glue blew up

10
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:36,289
and you know bubba 97 and and blue

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,440
skittles we were just talking about or

12
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:40,760
even some of the more modern pushes but

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,399
is there a way for you to kind of get

14
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,079
feedback from the open market to go hey

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,780
maybe i should do something that's a bit

16
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,670
of maybe a retro Acapulco gold crossed

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,829
with Northern Lights yeah you know

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,448
there's a company called seed junkie but

19
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,969
there are seed junkies out there there

20
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:57,558
is a whole phenomena of people that are

21
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:59,390
paying attention to the breeders that

22
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,858
are coming out with the new stuff and

23
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,500
we're you know we're seeing trends you

24
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:06,200
knows oh geez for a long time then it

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,390
was everything with cookies and now like

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,859
purple punch came on the market now I'm

27
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,930
seeing all these things that are crossed

28
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,340
with purple punch so I think it's just

29
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,840
always gonna be an evolving thing and

30
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,030
then how do you make how do you know

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,939
that's going to hit or gonna become a is

32
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,280
I think it boils down a the quality of

33
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:24,228
the genetics and then you know B is

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,140
marketing and market outreach you know

35
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:29,688
get get someone that's well-known to

36
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,810
hype it up and you know really cover

37
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:35,539
that or win a cup with that strain but

38
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,269
that's that's kind of another artistry

39
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,070
and beauty and growing cannabis is that

40
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:42,078
the sky's the limit and yeah you know

41
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:44,298
really it's just getting into breeding

42
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,429
on my farms and trying to do some

43
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:48,590
selections and I mean that is all that's

44
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,680
a lot of work it doesn't take much space

45
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,780
it's really high volume production and

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,909
low square footage or small square

47
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,618
footage so it's attractive in that

48
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,170
regard and it's always attractive to

49
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:02,509
make something new and exciting so I

50
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,100
think once we get all our operations in

51
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,709
place that that's going to be the next

52
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:09,049
fun thing is to focus on breeding and

53
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,879
work with other breeders that are

54
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,830
and then using their their material

55
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,359
someone like Kevin is like super into

56
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,910
that Kevin Joe dream I love it eating

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,620
that stuff you know it's it almost takes

58
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:21,229
over the passion from growing the plan

59
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,900
agree to just being the breeding factor

60
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:24,979
and you know that hunt and seeing what

61
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,080
males are gonna be that you're gonna

62
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,810
select and teaming them up with the

63
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,290
females and you know just creating that

64
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,810
cross and there's widget with wizardry

65
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:38,689
artistry and a little bit of luck I'd

66
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,069
say so Mike so you never know you get

67
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:42,979
something you see I mean we can bring

68
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:44,810
the lab into the equation yeah but I'm a

69
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:45,949
little bit of a seed hunter and I'm

70
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,719
looking for someone's like I'm looking

71
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:50,299
and I've I've heard it exists in

72
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,460
Amsterdam that someone has a true pure

73
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,250
Acapulco gold that's some sort of cross

74
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:58,640
bred or back red but I agree with you

75
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,530
it's an art one concern I have is you

76
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,029
know something great comes along but

77
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,430
we're so busy trying to constantly

78
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,750
innovate and change it and unfortunately

79
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,400
in the state's it's kind of a race to

80
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,169
the top right a lot of us that are

81
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,659
purists are little bummed that it's this

82
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:15,199
whole THC race - oh I've got it renoble

83
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:17,209
that's a 36% a 38% it's overkill my

84
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,009
concern is if everyone's racing to the

85
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,080
next thing what about some of those

86
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:22,729
coveted strains we low loved and grew up

87
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,250
with right like an like a true Northern

88
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:27,739
Lights you know which I know Joey has I

89
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,360
know he's got it but it's like are we

90
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,909
gonna miss out on some of those coveted

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,410
- you know so yeah it really bothers me

92
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:36,139
that people pay so much attention to

93
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:39,139
hybrid sativa indica like whatever or

94
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:41,629
potency levels it's like I person would

95
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:43,489
never judge any cannabis that I want to

96
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:46,340
consume or check it out sent by the

97
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:48,740
percentage or whether it's a hybrid or

98
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,780
sativa I mean when it's growing it's

99
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,969
very obvious for most growers to tell

100
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,759
that has some sativa qualities and I

101
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:57,080
like sativas but everything pretty much

102
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,269
at this point unless you're getting into

103
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:03,440
some tree landrace stores everything's a

104
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:06,530
hybrid sativa domineer hybrid or indica

105
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,930
dominant it's also it's all canvas

106
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,069
and that's exactly it's interesting we

107
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,349
even look at something that's like a

108
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:15,379
skittles which is always look it doesn't

109
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:18,889
have much bag appeal yeah usually tests

110
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:21,199
around 14% but it tastes so good I think

111
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,019
it's a Blue Diamond man oh hey it's a

112
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,759
blue side of the

113
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,609
I agree it's such a well-rounded and

114
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,079
Jodi gets into and I think it's the next

115
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,300
phase it's more of the turkey and say

116
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:33,370
what I I love Mersin I'm eliminating

117
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,590
like there's certain Terps I know that I

118
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,329
love more so but it's funny you mention

119
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:39,819
that because you nights back at the

120
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:41,109
Cannabis with Ricardo Baca they did a

121
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,389
whole documentary he is saying called

122
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,980
rolling papers and the producer every

123
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,899
opportunity he had he had asked is he's

124
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,129
like are you high right now you know in

125
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:49,989
asking someone if they're high right now

126
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:51,550
in this industry is very similar to

127
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,590
asking someone are you indica or sativa

128
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,810
I laugh when someone asked that because

129
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:58,149
yeah if I had to choose I'm an indigent

130
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,800
indica dominant guy I'm a nighttime

131
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:02,289
medical I'm an advocate on the medicinal

132
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,420
side my ailments more so I deal with in

133
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,210
the evenings at night but it's funny

134
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,730
when people are like indica sativa or

135
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:11,259
hybrid it's like really pretty much

136
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,150
every I would venture to guess I don't

137
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,769
which room I'd say 80% plus out there

138
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:16,959
are hybrids right yeah on the shelves

139
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:18,639
easy I mean it's just crazy to think

140
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,709
that someone has a pure sativa pure

141
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,509
indica I guess your point landrace I'm

142
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:24,669
that's only if you can find something

143
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:27,459
that's truly out of Afghan or truly out

144
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:31,470
of you know South Africa truly out of

145
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:31,469
row I mean it's just hard right yeah

146
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:43,360
