1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
appellation it's coming so Sam we're

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,649
gonna start with you because you had

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,500
some thoughts on Appalachian and you're

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,879
growing a native soil in Lake County so

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,259
you could have the Lake County

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,210
Appalachian so let's talk Appalachian so

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,189
I guess first of all some of you guys

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,589
probably heard me talk to I spent a lot

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:28,589
of panels with Frenchy and you know

10
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:30,660
Justin and a few other people what am i

11
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,308
but my main things about Appalachians is

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,340
like if you if you look at the French

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,140
system in United States system the

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,879
French system is about insane amount of

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,710
control

16
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:42,780
and it's also you know it attempts to

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,090
tell the consumer what is a good product

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,450
and it's and it's about cultural

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,489
progress of preservation on methodology

20
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:55,199
and that methodology is kind of hindered

21
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:57,538
on zero change but in the marketplace

22
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,698
it's it's it's its reasoning is to

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,879
attempt to tell the consumer what is

24
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,859
good and what is bad the United States

25
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,239
system is kind of goes along with you

26
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,930
know in the United States culture and

27
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:14,390
laissez-faire capitalism and it lets the

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:18,840
consumer decide what is good quality and

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:22,618
what with that comes you know a lot of

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,030
issues and so when you have a lot of

31
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:26,750
people say hey we want like a French

32
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,219
system for a cultural preservation yet

33
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,009
we want to call we want to say that we

34
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:35,179
have terroir and we're you know we're

35
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,670
rocking in in you know happy frog soil

36
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,280
we're in a greenhouse you know those

37
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,210
things are autonomous to what terroir is

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,599
I'd argue in it with with the United

39
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:50,399
States great you know with the great

40
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,739
viticulture is that if you use roundup

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,728
you can't claim it out well you can't

42
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,000
you shouldn't be able to claim an

43
00:01:53,728 --> 00:02:00,718
appellation or a terroir because roundup

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,430
kills the microbiome on the soil and so

45
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,199
you know I I'm not saying the United

46
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,630
States system is perfect or better or

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,300
you know but I also don't think that

48
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:10,799
what a lot of these a lot of people are

49
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,990
trying to instill in count the

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,410
California Appalachians

51
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,330
for cannabis you know they want to say

52
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,159
oh well you know we've worked the soil

53
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,290
for 20 years and it's regenerative and

54
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,189
such and it's like yeah that's still not

55
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:29,129
native soil it's still not native soil

56
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:31,759
and so I kind of to thesis points of

57
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:35,009
California cannabis Appalachians are

58
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:38,039
100% native soil less than 2 percent by

59
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:40,439
volume inputs and I've written comments

60
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:44,579
to CFA about this when they were just

61
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:48,090
doing their thing and then also that

62
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,830
there can be no no covering between you

63
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,560
and the you and the Sun if you actually

64
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,740
want to be to actually declare yourself

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,289
an appellation you know another thing is

66
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,370
like I just don't think that

67
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:00,989
unfortunately consumers care about it

68
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,990
right now it's gonna matter in 10 or 20

69
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,290
years for sure but right now they're

70
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,830
such a select few people that actually

71
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:11,549
care about it

72
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,650
I assume Frenchy would agree with what

73
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,189
you just said right does he disagree

74
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,430
with any of that

75
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:20,099
I always feel like hit his when his you

76
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,200
know veins start popping it's when

77
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,479
people are calling something appellation

78
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:28,049
that isn't what the French definition of

79
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:30,149
appellation is it's like I think a

80
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,400
little bit more on like you have to do

81
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,030
they want to have extreme control like

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,890
sorry who's they the French know there's

83
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,800
there's people in the cannabis community

84
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,509
that they want to say hey you can't grow

85
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,239
long belly cush outside of waiting

86
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:48,689
though and call it you know and call it

87
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,890
you know the use that destination of the

88
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:52,829
name or you know they want to use

89
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:54,599
different strain issues like that then

90
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,910
there's also a lot of folks minute I

91
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,849
understood I've argued with someone in

92
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:01,979
San Francisco about how their their

93
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:03,769
different warehouses of indoor had

94
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:06,389
different appellations

95
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,849
I'm not kidding like someone

96
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:12,509
legitimately tried to argue that point

97
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:15,419
to me because of you know and I was just

98
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:16,829
kind of like what you know so there's

99
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,349
just a lot of folks that I think the

100
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,029
biggest one to me that the Canada that

101
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,310
most of the canvas where I differ than

102
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,829
most of the cannabis community is is

103
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,538
soil that you can't I don't think

104
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:31,709
be able to use any import soil

105
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:33,810
whatsoever and still call yourself an

106
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:35,878
Appalachian or it or even necessarily

107
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,418
doesn't need a county of origin without

108
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:45,090
having native soil but it also has to be

109
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:46,769
in the ground yeah yeah the terroir also

110
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:49,348
encompasses so much more than just the

111
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:51,389
soil also into it also encompasses the

112
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:53,579
people and the culture and the practices

113
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,560
of the people that are cultivating it I

114
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:56,758
think that often gets lost and I'm not

115
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,918
taking away anything from what you're

116
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,020
saying but if you want to get down to

117
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,389
like the argument about like the the

118
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:06,120
warehouses in San Francisco there's a

119
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:08,069
culture behind that there's a culture

120
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,110
and that there are people behind that

121
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,270
and and they definitely influence

122
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,189
because plug and play and take some

123
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:16,829
growers from Sacramento and put them

124
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:22,529
into the same warehouse it's going to

125
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:25,948
change the outcome so there there are

126
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:27,239
arguments to be made for in Appalachia

127
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:30,449
of the different neighborhoods

128
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,129
especially when you consider the people

129
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:35,879
that are involved and I think that's one

130
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:39,060
of the most important aspects of of in

131
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,848
Appalachia or terroir is the people it's

132
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,278
the relationship between the people that

133
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:46,860
are cultivating and the plants that

134
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:48,509
helps to define to define what I'm

135
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,400
talking about land race here we're

136
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:53,669
talking about plants in the wild we're

137
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:58,500
talking about plants that that undergo a

138
00:05:53,668 --> 00:06:00,750
daily interaction with the workforce and

139
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,149
the cultural practices and if you want

140
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,180
to get back to the French definition

141
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:07,679
Appalachia one of my issues with them is

142
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,319
a lot of that stuff was said in the

143
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,718
1700s yeah okay if you're in this

144
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,889
section of soil now your Grand Cru and

145
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:18,538
if you're over here you're such and such

146
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:20,460
that takes away from the terroir of the

147
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:22,769
people that are building the soil when I

148
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,930
when I got my property it was all clay I

149
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:26,818
built human culture beds I did from the

150
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,598
cultural practices I did chopped and

151
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:37,020
drop I turned a lot of my clay into loam

152
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:39,569
and so is it made of soil it's natively

153
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:44,159
built soil

154
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:47,790
and and if I can do that in five years

155
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,210
how is it that in 300 years everybody

156
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:54,750
who was still grand cru back then is a

157
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:57,569
grand cru right now because of a map

158
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,100
that was defined way way back then

159
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:04,589
that's something I don't want to see

160
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:06,480
yeah yeah who developed those mats it

161
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:09,750
was like the large landowners the Kings

162
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,640
the Queen's oligarchy of that time and

163
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,180
you know I guess the one thing that I'd

164
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,550
say we disagree on is the fact that I

165
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,740
the culture side a bit of people it you

166
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,250
know you can either classify terroir

167
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:26,910
through science or you can classify it

168
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,350
through a cultural aspect and one of the

169
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,460
things that a lot of you know in order

170
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,960
to designate a your own a VA in the

171
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,569
United States you have to prove

172
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:39,989
scientifically that it has a day that

173
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:41,189
the the climate and the soil and

174
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,430
everything irrelevant

175
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:47,790
leads to a different outcome in the end

176
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,230
product and one of the issues with the

177
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,990
cultural side of it is that

178
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:55,200
yeah there's methodologies of such that

179
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,110
could lead you to but if it's not if you

180
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,759
take a person out of it and it's not

181
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,110
replicatable in the same place I mean it

182
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,680
wouldn't really have terroir in that

183
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,389
location

184
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:09,019
it's then it's just an entire a

185
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:13,319
humanistic aspect of it I don't know I

186
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:15,689
think that I think that that you can you

187
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,259
can break down the culture to a

188
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:21,569
scientific level the methodology and the

189
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,659
practices of the people that are are

190
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:27,509
working has a very scientifically

191
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,990
describable and measurable effect and

192
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:34,229
impact on the plan yeah all right I

193
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,960
could I could see that you know I think

194
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:39,750
back to your statement earlier about you

195
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,340
know soil building that's a very

196
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,429
different level of soil building than

197
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:47,280
saying you know adding 10 percent

198
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:49,319
perlite to your native soil sure and

199
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,379
that's that's my problem that I have

200
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,210
with well we're we we started with the

201
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:56,519
with you know 20 years ago we got a

202
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,629
truckload of ancient forests and that's

203
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,009
what we started with and now it's

204
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:01,559
regenerative you know it's a very

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:04,139
different thing and actually you know

206
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:05,549
going through biodynamic methodologies

207
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,850
on your own property with everything

208
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:11,699
from your property it's a very different

209
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,050
aspect I think one thing about like for

210
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,030
instance I guess my you know we're

211
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,740
talking about a lot earlier about um you

212
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:20,549
know just the regulatory burden and the

213
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:24,180
regulatory framework what I don't like

214
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:25,859
about what a lot of what a lot of people

215
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:28,500
in the cannabis industry are advocating

216
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,269
for with appellations is an essentially

217
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,009
a whole entire other regulatory

218
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,079
framework that you have to operate

219
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:38,069
within to try to get some market

220
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,170
viability and that is where I'm kind of

221
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,640
like wait I gotta do all these set of

222
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:42,899
rules and all these set of rules now I'm

223
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,809
supposed to do all those set of rules

224
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,679
that I don't necessarily agree with all

225
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:51,209
of them I think it's a it's a hard

226
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:53,939
that's a hard sell for me when people

227
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,129
are asking for an extremely high

228
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,530
regulatory burden just to claim an

229
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,809
appellation so if you want to get the

230
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:03,509
organic certification and the

231
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:06,929
appellation designation you got a lot of

232
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:12,090
regulatory hurdles to jump through for

233
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:14,250
the record so just just you know I'm

234
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,769
gonna go through the hoops to do it

235
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:23,190
because I believe in it but at the same

236
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:25,799
time it's not so cumbersome that it

237
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,510
makes it you know a really hard business

238
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,099
decision it's an easier business

239
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:31,169
decision and easier to sell to my

240
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,730
partners well I think one thing that's

241
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:34,949
really important not to get lost here in

242
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,690
this part of the conversation is the

243
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,970
fact that regulations actually leading

244
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,920
to the death of appellations that had

245
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,889
already existed before there is an e

246
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,360
like ABA or any board to dictate that

247
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:45,899
and I'm seeing that right here in Santa

248
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,100
Cruz County

249
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:52,409
yeah like the traditional growing areas

250
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,019
where the culture is existed where the

251
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:58,709
Blue Dream has come from where all these

252
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:02,429
other old Big Sur holy weed and a lot of

253
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:05,740
other old strains were founded and based

254
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:08,849
are being eradicated by conditioners

255
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:15,519
it's and the zoning regulations that

256
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:19,210
don't align with health and safety or or

257
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:22,149
or or cannabis and just they have to do

258
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:26,769
with other agendas but that's the silent

259
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:29,049
killer of of the existing population and

260
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,490
I can only speak firsthand about senator

261
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:33,399
Cruz County because that's what I live

262
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,169
and I hate to like keep bringing it back

263
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,990
to Santa Cruz County but that's my frame

264
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:39,789
of reference because that's that's where

265
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,220
I met and I know that there's growers in

266
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:45,250
Calaveras and growers in Nevada County

267
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:51,460
and Yuba who are all experiencing

268
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:55,500
different forms of of barriers they have

269
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:58,750
tragedy the tragedy for us to lose these

270
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:03,970
these heritage terroirs

271
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:06,639
to things like f1 permits yeah whatever

272
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,550
you call them the tragedy is losing them

273
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,189
yeah exactly

274
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:15,879
all right well gentlemen on that we just

275
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:19,360
passed 420 I got a five-year-old who I

276
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:22,500
promised to go rollerblading with so we

277
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,269
will wrap on the the Appalachian

278
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:31,289
conversation I appreciate your time and

279
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:31,289
your stories and have a great weekend
