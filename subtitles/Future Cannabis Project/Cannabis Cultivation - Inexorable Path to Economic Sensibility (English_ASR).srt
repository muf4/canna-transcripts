1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,139
a fair portion of what shingle hill my

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,189
company does is work with large pools of

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:07,139
capital that are trying to figure out

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,550
how to play the cannabis industry and a

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,629
lot of them are looking at investments

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,639
they've already made that they believe

7
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,960
to be relatively safe in the industry

8
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:14,308
which for the most part you know the

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,160
last year or two has been the Canadian

10
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:18,269
companies and so as we've gotten the

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,760
point where those guys are building out

12
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,169
infrastructure and they're talking about

13
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,250
you know what Canada's can consume and

14
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,810
if you look at the Canadian market

15
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,980
versus the Californian market you think

16
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:27,799
you know thirty five million people in

17
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,089
Canada and 39 million people in

18
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,618
California you can roughly get a sense

19
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:33,570
of how big that market ultimately will

20
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,609
be you know call it a seven billion

21
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,079
eight billion dollar annual market in

22
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:38,070
Canada but you look at what they're

23
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,329
actually building out the way of

24
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,100
infrastructure and you're talking about

25
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,320
the canopies the aurorus they're free is

26
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,300
the the Cronos you know cobbling

27
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,250
together different groups green organic

28
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,169
Dutchman all these companies that are

29
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,390
all still building out because you know

30
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,410
demand is still outpacing supply but

31
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,210
ultimately you're gonna hit a point of

32
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:55,679
equilibrium but the plans these guys

33
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,820
have if you actually look at they're

34
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,738
blowing right past that equilibrium

35
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,939
point they're going to you know right to

36
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:01,439
a point they're saying we're gonna do

37
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,119
you know nine hundred thousand square

38
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,338
feet of greenhouse or we're gonna do you

39
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,329
know whatever how many hectares or how

40
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:08,069
many hundreds of thousands of square

41
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,750
feet and when you actually extrapolate

42
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,579
that back against what the size of the

43
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,590
market is you know they're they're

44
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,179
building out in a way that can't be

45
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,850
supported so when you talk to these CEOs

46
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,740
yeah well that's easy we're gonna export

47
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:22,379
you know we're able to export in Canada

48
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,599
and you know I go okay to who

49
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,438
yeah who's gonna buy it right now

50
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,149
they're talking about the European

51
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,368
market which you know for the near term

52
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,549
it's probably viable you know Germany

53
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:33,659
might viable Portugal might be viable

54
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,939
but ultimately Germany scam its own

55
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,049
market yeah Portugal's in its own market

56
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,089
every one of the European countries will

57
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,579
have their own markets it's a stopgap

58
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,109
it's a short-term proposition and then

59
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:44,368
you're talking about you know some of

60
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:45,868
the Latin countries that are coming on

61
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:48,180
you know that people are talking about

62
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:51,780
exporting to Colombia okay I'll explain

63
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,368
that to me because clearly positive it's

64
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,689
a perfect growing climate it's twelve

65
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:56,549
hours of sunshine every day it's twelve

66
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,349
hours of surface for you like it's the

67
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,909
perfect climate for flowering ants a

68
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:01,349
perfect temperature and they've got

69
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,130
mountainous areas if you had lower areas

70
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:03,328
you know there's so many different

71
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:05,609
appellations that you can actually work

72
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:06,929
from to say okay you know what do I want

73
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:08,550
to grow and where it's deciding like you

74
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,110
know do I want to coast layers my Pinot

75
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,600
Noir grapes versus you know do I want

76
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,670
you know open sort of warm weather

77
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,930
from our shard it's the same idea you

78
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:16,549
know down there you can produce stuff

79
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,319
for your labor cost is next to nothing

80
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,840
your your energy costs us next to

81
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,370
nothing your your access to perfect

82
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,719
sunny days is next nothing these

83
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,640
Canadian companies are saying oh we're

84
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:28,219
gonna be the the producer for the world

85
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:29,769
it doesn't make any sense what makes

86
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:31,729
sense is finding a great growing climate

87
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,469
producing an abundance there and then

88
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:35,989
shipping from there when a global market

89
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:37,849
emerges or even in the North American

90
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,200
market Canada's not supplying North

91
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,150
America okay that's not supplying

92
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,179
anything but maybe regionally in Canada

93
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,129
because they don't have the ability

94
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,439
nobody nobody's gonna be growing indoors

95
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:50,060
in four years it doesn't make any sense

96
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,789
you're producing two dollars a gram

97
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,469
instead of you know 30 cents a gram in a

98
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:56,389
super high-tech greenhouse that's fully

99
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:57,979
automated with the robotics attached to

100
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:59,629
it and that's where the industry is

101
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:01,310
moving that direction so all these guys

102
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:04,400
that like are you know building these

103
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,620
REITs to you know to support indoor

104
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,700
growers I keep telling them like ok

105
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,140
that's great for the first couple years

106
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:12,619
you're gonna have oversized returns on

107
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:14,269
your on your on your cap rate but

108
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,740
ultimately you know can that guys stay

109
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,120
in business and that's something right

110
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,040
now that I think people just aren't

111
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,960
thinking about is what's the cost of

112
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,000
production need to be to be competitive

113
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:29,360
in a global marketplace it's not gonna

114
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,710
be in Canada that's right yeah all went

115
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,390
to Columbia right in the end though the

116
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,340
entire thing went to Clemmy you look at

117
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:35,479
the tomato market that you know you want

118
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,830
to talk to someone understands has

119
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,719
talked to five Symington from copper

120
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,490
state farms in Arizona you know if I've

121
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,990
undercut every one of his competitors

122
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,120
and tomatoes that he's producing Cooley

123
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,530
con Mexico and then what I do came back

124
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,030
and bought those competitors the

125
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,530
greenhouses and now is producing

126
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,479
cannabis of you know snowflake Arizona

127
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,800
he's got 30 acre facility that used to

128
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,560
be one of those competitors and tomatoes

129
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,730
he crushed by going to Mexico so if that

130
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,289
doesn't show you you know kind of

131
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:59,030
migration of the market I mean Mexico

132
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:00,650
just announced that they're opening

133
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,390
their market I've been fielding calls

134
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,159
non-stop the last two weeks from the

135
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:06,009
Mexican market saying we really want to

136
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,969
do something down here now you know

137
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:09,379
granted you guys think about the the

138
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,729
graft and corruption that exists in that

139
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:12,049
country and the cartels and still the

140
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:13,429
stranglehold so it might be some time

141
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,870
before it goes in there but if you're

142
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,600
gonna say would you would you prefer to

143
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:21,620
be a cultivator of cannabis in Sinaloa

144
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,740
versus in Minnesota it's not even close

145
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,939
there's no comparison so that's really

146
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,250
what I think people need to realize that

147
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:30,228
as migration happens towards greater

148
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,269
legalization it's all gonna be about

149
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:34,870
highest quality lowest cost just like

150
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:34,870
any other commodity
