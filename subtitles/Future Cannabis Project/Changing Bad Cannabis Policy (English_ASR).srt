00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
one of my favorite recent stories is I

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,240
don't know if you guys know Cody bass up

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,330
in South Lake Tahoe who runs a

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,210
dispensary and recently got elected to

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,160
his City Council so that's the kind of

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,230
change when stuff gets interesting is

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,929
rather than just say oh I don't know the

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,689
politicians aren't on our side we can be

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:24,480
the politicians that's when the

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,670
interesting change starts to happen we

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,130
can show up at the city council meetings

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,990
we can show up at the town halls we can

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,149
take the seats on those advisory

14
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,429
councils and that is how we affect

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,600
change is not by sitting around and

16
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:38,399
complaining and watching what's

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,719
happening and having it at be something

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,520
that's happening to us this is a living

19
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:49,039
evolutionary process that we are part of

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,039
and we can change it
