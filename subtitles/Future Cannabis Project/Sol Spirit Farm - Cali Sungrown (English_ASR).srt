5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:17,920
amazing thank you

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,379
[Music]

7
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,559
all right walter walter is going to roll

8
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,079
us a joint

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:33,280
all right and this is dealer's choice

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:36,159
so walter is going for what he grew

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,520
at home this past season correct right

12
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,159
yeah we grew this in

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,520
our huge culture bed brand new huge

14
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,558
culture bed

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,399
uh almost no inputs at all really stoked

16
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,558
on how it came out it uh

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,799
placed seventh in the emerald cup so

18
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,839
we're super super proud of it and what

19
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,359
cut is it

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,399
it was a fruity pebbles og seedling

21
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,920
um which i've heard tends to be a rather

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,759
terpene dominant

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,000
strain and that this is no exception

24
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:07,759
there yeah um

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,319
and who gave it to you um

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,880
you know it was a freebie seed i think

27
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,279
from

28
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,640
equinox seeds i believe okay yeah i'd

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,118
have to double check on the

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,359
exact detail on that one but i'm pretty

31
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,040
sure that's where it came it was

32
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,519
it was just you know it came with

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,320
another pack of seeds

34
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:29,359
what are your expectations for like year

35
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:32,078
two and three of the same hugelbed

36
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,640
oh i think uh it's like you're one kind

37
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,879
of like

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,759
get it going and then like your highest

39
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,118
hopes are for

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,478
year like three probably but so one of

41
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,359
the things we did to

42
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:46,478
uh kind of jump start our eagle beds is

43
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,879
we used a lot of wood that was already

44
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,640
starting to decay a little bit you know

45
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,839
usually like the inner two-thirds is

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
still good and solid

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
but just outer bit still uh decomposing

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,478
already

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,079
and so it has uh those mycelium networks

50
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,640
running a lot quicker

51
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,639
and so my experience has been those

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,200
first year hugo's kick butt

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,959
and uh we've got we got some huge

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
culture beds now that are three and four

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,439
years old that

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,560
they're they're raging strong still um i

57
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,359
couldn't say they're really better or

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
worse

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,040
than they were that first year but i

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,719
have heard a fair number of people that

61
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,479
have had

62
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,400
you know it require a lot of compost and

63
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,719
stuff those first couple of years

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,159
uh because probably not using the

65
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,560
decomposed wood let's say

66
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,680
year seven or whatever when everything's

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,840
totally broken down like

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,879
are you moving on from that hugo bed are

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,680
you loving it

70
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,959
and still using it as just regular soil

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,920
that's very

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,800
nutrient rich right so you know that's

73
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,878
something to be

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,040
to be determined a bit you know i'm

75
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,719
fairly new to the human culture thing

76
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,719
one one thing we've heard is that you

77
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,680
can kind of put wood in from the side a

78
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,598
bit

79
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
uh and that's what i'm doing with some

80
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,518
of my

81
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,959
20 year old soil because i don't want to

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,599
dig it up

83
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,199
and flip it uh it's it's been where it's

84
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,479
been and we've been you know growing

85
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,958
there for a long time

86
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,560
so we're uh we're on a little bit of

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,680
hillside so we're just infilling on the

88
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,360
edges

89
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,319
with uh with a little bit of

90
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,640
wood to to add you know that huge

91
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,560
culture effect to it

92
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,759
by the way do you want stronger winds

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,400
when you're trying to roll a joint

94
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,798
outside

95
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,280
you know i'd have to say that normally

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,599
stronger winds when rolling a joint or

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
not

98
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,158
or in general when even doing an event

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,680
like this

100
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,759
stronger winds are not the preference

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
and this is the wedding cake you guys

102
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,079
did last season

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,120
right and what's this one that one's the

104
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,400
mother's milk

105
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,920
yeah and the macmelon in the next jar

106
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,400
and then there's some blueberry muffin

107
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,639
over there too

108
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,640
and the papers are challenging today

109
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,080
not just the rolling papers all the

110
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,080
papers

111
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:11,359
this is the walter technique right

112
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,239
you know the goal is to get as much weed

113
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,599
in as small of a paper as possible so

114
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,840
otherwise you have what i'm

115
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,879
what i consider an improper balance of

116
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,798
paper to weed

117
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,319
yeah so you got to minimize the amount

118
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,478
of paper

119
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,079
maximized and what type of paper do you

120
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,439
like to use personally

121
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,959
so i you know i enjoy the raw organics

122
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,719
and the elements uh

123
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:37,839
clubs i really like um

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,280
anything that's you know clean enough um

125
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,159
you know and thin

126
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,918
it's gotta be thin it's gotta be clean i

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,840
used to use just the clubs the

128
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,839
without glue but uh at this point

129
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,959
they only are making the smaller papers

130
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,879
so

131
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,839
i can't roll uh i can't roll a proper

132
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,839
grower joint with that

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,519
you know just a little and so tell me

134
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,159
about the smoke for this one

135
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,799
what do you like about it so this is a

136
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,000
the terpenoline dominant is less than 10

137
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,280
of the flour out there uh according to a

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,918
couple of labs

139
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,038
uh and it's it is that really focused

140
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,918
daytime sativa

141
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,680
type of flower um so you know if you've

142
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,359
got a meeting to go to but you know you

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
still need to take care of your head

144
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,560
if i have like sort of a hundred seed

145
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
packs to pack

146
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,639
up i will be focused on the task right

147
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,320
exactly this is not a

148
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,079
right because so this mother's milk

149
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,879
great sativa also

150
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,159
not so focusy though it's like it's on

151
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,038
the hybridy end of

152
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,840
sativa for sure this is just this is as

153
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,319
uh

154
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,679
as sativa as i've smoked in a long time

155
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,159
so we're really stoked

156
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,079
uh fruity pebbles og did not sound to me

157
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,199
like

158
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,560
sativa i sound like og and fruity

159
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,038
pebbles i don't know

160
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
i wasn't expecting this out of it so you

161
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:07,759
never know though what

162
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,199
what seeds will do and you never know

163
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,400
maybe somebody mislabeled a jar

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,520
somewhere

165
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,399
it happens to the best of us here's your

166
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,799
doobie

167
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:21,120
well thank you yeah it's exciting

168
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,160
all right let's uh i wish we could sit

169
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,600
in this car

170
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,280

carrying coronavirus right now wow this

193
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,598
is this is a ride

194
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,000
i feel like i'm getting on the ground oh

195
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,839
yeah they say they make an electric one

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,598
that's what i want to check out what it

197
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,079
what kind of car is it

198
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,439
bander hall there you go that's what it

199
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,439
says on the wheels too

200
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,079
i need a bit oh cool it is a stair all

201
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,598
right there we go yeah that's

202
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,399
but there's no uh there's no

203
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,120
flash nope you know i think clutch has

204
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,120
gone out of style

205
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:59,199
that is confusing though but that would

206
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,638
imply that it's like a modern built

207
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,400
it is modern built okay very modern

208
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,160
built

209
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,878
it would be amazing if we both had a

210
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,960
little cup holder right here with water

211
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,039
bam i don't see a cup holder

212
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,318
and i have to say even for for two

213
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,318
people we're cozy

214
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,560
i'm looking around to see if i spot new

215
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,279
water

216
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,439
water i've got some water over yonders

217
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,878
it's not within reach though technically

218
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,879
all right so we could drive over there

219
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,918
when that guy's not looking this is

220
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,759
fucking windy the wind yeah

221
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,559
i could not imagine being jody playing

222
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,240
golf right now and not hating my like

223
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,918
nothing makes you hate your golf

224
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,560
abilities more than wind

225
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,000
all right see i don't win or win enough

226
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,119
i don't golf enough to know about the

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,958
wind

228
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,799
although you know i frisbee golf

229
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:57,759
sometimes so

230
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,759
not very often but it happens

231
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,000
so what do you think about the flavor of

232
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:09,838
that one

233
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,839
i like it me too

234
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,839
often that's my abnormal thing

235
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,159
you don't see any water anywhere to you

236
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:34,928
[Music]

237
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,360
watch out for that phone on the corner

238
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,360
there all right so give me your

239
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,440
assessment of uh

240
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,639
where the california market is right now

241
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,120
are you sad

242
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,199
are you happy are you optimistic oh i'm

243
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,639
totally optimistic

244
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,000
i feel like california market is a 13

245
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,759
year old boy

246
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,080
running into the liquor store and

247
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:01,360
grabbing the airport clear

248
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,440
i'm good thank you you are amazing

249
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,159
no that's that's where i think the

250
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,160
market's at it's a 13 year old boy going

251
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,958
well i get every clear i'm going to get

252
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:14,159
really really messed up really quick

253
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,439
um and you know a couple years maybe

254
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,679
we'll get a little more mature and we'll

255
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,000
move on some craft beers

256
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,159
and then even a couple years later we'll

257
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,919
be on to the fine wines

258
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,199
and once we get to the fine wines and

259
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,799
you know what there's some of us that

260
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,360
are there already

261
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,159
right you're enjoying fine flavors you

262
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,919
know it

263
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,078
there's there's there's those of us that

264
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:37,039
are are in the know already

265
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,719
and we have to find find those you know

266
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,039
make those connections

267
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,160
they have to find are we there's so much

268
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,439
noise and and it's just so new they like

269
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,078
you know it's going to take some time

270
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,399
for this dust to settle

271
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,399
i guess the other the other part of it

272
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
though is like can the craft farmers

273
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,039
survive until

274
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,320
that time when like even the other part

275
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,919
would be when you can sell

276
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,040
globally right so i mean

277
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:08,159
there we we do have some advantages

278
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:12,319
as the craft farmer some of us

279
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,319
uh have been doing this for 20 years

280
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,120
these new farms they don't have 20 years

281
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,920
under their belt

282
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,879
they um but they were trying to they got

283
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,199
a lot of money

284
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,679
but they're trying to go from from you

285
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,000
know zero to run in a marathon

286
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,759
without having to run the 5k first

287
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,120
without having fucking graduated from

288
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,159
the 5k

289
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,679
and keep moving you know so

290
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,759
yeah this that's where that's where

291
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,519
we're at and uh

292
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,519
i think so we've got some advantages

293
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,240
there and yeah we can't compete with

294
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,278
them on mids

295
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,600
they're going to kill it they're going

296
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:57,838
to crush the mids market

297
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:57,839
very comfortable

298
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,399
it is strong but i'll be focused on that

299
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,600
drive focus

300
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,759
clear in my car

301
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,360
when they make an electric or like they

302
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,200
say

303
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,639
they say he said they make one when i

304
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,160
can afford one yeah

305
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,000
that might when i can afford one and

306
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,519
they haven't let that be a badass

307
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,360
fuck yeah that thing would be fast as

308
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,560
fuck too this thing is

309
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,800
he said it weighs under a thousand

310
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,439
pounds thing must squirt out and go it's

311
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:30,319
got a four cylinder

312
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
although not quite a highway car well

313
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,959
you know

314
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,519
instead it goes 140 that'll that'll get

315
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,319
you on the highway

316
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,519
yeah then you get hit by like the suv

317
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,720
and

318
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,799
yeah no there's those things too

319
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,560
yeah yeah no i'm really stoked of the

320
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,078
strain it's really

321
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:54,399
tasty pungent

322
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,599
be happier with the coming seventh of

323
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,120
them so then

324
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,519
would that be something you'll now put

325
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,959
in the commercial but yeah yeah yeah

326
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,399
yep so we we uh we had some seeds of it

327
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,479
and we're growing those out on the

328
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,919
commercial side of it and then are you

329
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,079
fino hunting too

330
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:13,838

331
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,039

332
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,040

337
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,039
but so we know that in in outdoor it'll

338
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,279
do a

339
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:33,838
25 thc and it'll do uh

340
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,958
almost four percent terps so i've got

341
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,560
high hopes for it

342
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:42,159
um and it was dense and super nice so

343
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,159
i got you know it was epic

344
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,880
i'm excited to smoke what comes next

345
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,639
like yeah

346
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,240
well we have a couple other new strains

347
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,120
coming out too that we're really excited

348
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,240
about

349
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,560
i ran some uh burmese mimosas

350
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,600
last year that uh fino hunted out a

351
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,119
couple of

352
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,320
and i'm gonna keep going on the fina

353
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,519
hunt but the flavor

354
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,480
i think you know i'm hoping it'll it'll

355
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,919
cross that 20 thc number because the

356
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,959
teenagers in this

357
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,439
13 year old market are grabbing that 20

358
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,479
thc and they're like the retailers won't

359
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,800
won't buy

360
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,839
the lower stuff it's odd too because

361
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,479
it's like a vicious

362
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,920
circle of like a negative feedback well

363
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,759
and and here's the thing is

364
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,198
leafly did an article where 60-something

365
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,720
percent

366
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,319
of the consumers said they wanted less

367
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,079
than 20 percent

368
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,680
but those aren't the loud guys coming in

369
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,599
the end of the place those are the

370
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,879
old-timers going in and looking and

371
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,639
reading the labels

372
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,078
and the young kid comes in i want the

373
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,240
stuff with what's a 100

374
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,879
thc and that's what they're paying

375
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,639
attention to and so i feel like there

376
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,399
actually is more of a market

377
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,240
we actually did have to put some lower

378
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,320
thc stuff on the market

379
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,720
and and we have a hard time getting it

380
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,278
into a dispensary but once it's in

381
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,278
that one develops a fan fan base because

382
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,159
there isn't that much low thc stuff on

383
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,078
the market

384
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,078
not everybody wants to get ripped out of

385
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,919
their gourd on one hit

386
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,198
some folks would maybe even like take

387
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,078
the second hit before they get ripped

388
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,198
out of their gourd

389
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,278
and some people don't even want to get

390
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:12,799
ripped out of their gourd it's crazy

391
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,919
right we're all different we're all

392
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,399
looking for a different thing and a

393
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,958
different

394
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,839
you know different tolerance levels and

395
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,359
all that and we're

396
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,199
just lumping everyone into a couple

397
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,919
categories

398
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,039
so you're looking forward to the choir i

399
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,360
am i am

400
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,519
no it's just you know we got we got to

401
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,919
get that consumer education is

402
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,360
is the key that's that's what i think is

403
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,679
amazing about what you're doing is

404
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,519
uh that's what i try to do like it's

405
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,958
it's like

406
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,120
that that's why the whole event thing

407
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,439
where like i want to smoke la people

408
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,120
out with like amazing outdoor norcal

409
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,800
weeds and just be like what do you all

410
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,039
think because that's what we're doing

411
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,198
yeah yeah that's why i do these

412
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,879
these events that's why i for me it's

413
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,879
worth it making it here and they're like

414
00:15:52,879 --> 00:16:00,078
oh yeah that's outdoor

415
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,078
outdoor sun grown organic and like

416
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,278
i really think that a lot of people have

417
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,039
been buying

418
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,439
you know whatever what came out of

419
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,078
humboldt and the emerald triangle

420
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,880
trinity mendocino whatever came out of

421
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:15,359
there that was really nice and dense

422
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,399
outdoor it didn't get sold as outdoor

423
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,800
when it got to the

424
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,679
buyer they were buying it as indoor

425
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,719
because it looked nice

426
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,078
and it could pass and you know i mean i

427
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,959
know they're changing the name three

428
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,159
times

429
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,319
you know like it wouldn't even stay

430
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,240
in like it wouldn't stay the same name

431
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,920
as i'm selling it to the first guy

432
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,480
he'd be like no no i'm calling this this

433
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:40,799
and this this like what but it

434
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,680
is what i said on the bag like no no

435
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:46,159
all right so i don't know there's some

436
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,479
great things about legalization for sure

437
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,000
and uh one of the things is we can come

438
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,039
out of the indoor closet

439
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,799
and we can grow in the full sun um

440
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,879
kind of make hurts my stomach when i see

441
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,120
all these inversions smoke people out

442
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,919
fuck yeah you know i love giving away

443
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,919
weed

444
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,439
um you know a little personal share

445
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,798
stuff here and there and

446
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,959
and turn people on to uh what what it's

447
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:12,000
all about

448
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,959
because it is that sun growing

449
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,199
is the answer we can do it

450
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,839
regeneratively instead of killing the

451
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,079
planet

452
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,759
and that's super important you know i

453
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,399
want a place for my kid

454
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,879
i think that's pretty important those

455
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,038
are all

456
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,880
good goals to have in life i support i

457
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,919
believe in everyone yeah yeah

458
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,919
right on right on

459
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,480
this thing's meant to go faster than

460
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,480
this

461
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,160
i like it's like that i don't i forgot i

462
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,480
have sunglasses

463
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,960
oh fuck yeah me too we're sitting in the

464
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,960
sun now

465
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,038
we had a little umbrella

466
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:52,798
i think the umbrella at 140 miles an

467
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:56,879
hour would be hard to hold onto

468
00:17:52,798 --> 00:18:01,519
that's my guess yeah because i would

469
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,960
my legs would not stay this pale

470
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,038
they would have a hard time staying that

471
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,798
pail i keep from this pail by being

472
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,359
upright

473
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,599
and then there's not a shadow or there's

474
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,798
a shadow yeah yeah that's not

475
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,558
that's how we say that it's crazy to

476
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,960
think that people used to race

477
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:23,119
like uh like old car races and cars like

478
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,720
this with like the

479
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,719
like pilot goggles

480
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,519
how's it going like the le mans and

481
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,440
stuff

482
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,558
like that and that car like the skinny

483
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,558
