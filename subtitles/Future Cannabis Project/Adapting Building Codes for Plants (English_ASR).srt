1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
[Music]

2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:12,179
we are gonna talk a little bit about

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,400
codes now and a bigger not so focused on

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,890
the specifics of the California code

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
that Kyle was looking for last night but

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,028
really stepping back a little bit taking

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,609
a look more broadly at how codes are

8
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:25,710
developed their role the different parts

9
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,618
that come into play and sort of what the

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,289
action has been on the codes front for

11
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,329
CEA facilities so we have a great

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,370
stellar panel here with lots of

13
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,770
experience we're gonna hear from Keith

14
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,939
Corson of desert air he's gonna talk to

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,280
us a little bit about some of the

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:45,599
various industry led codes and standards

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,850
affecting the industry and the and the

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,050
equipment that's being used we'll hear

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,210
from Alexei Miller with the new

20
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:54,448
buildings Institute who's been doing

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,579
work on codes a national the national

22
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:59,519
model codes as well as input to other

23
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,558
codes across the country and then from

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,049
Kyle booth with a little bit more on

25
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:07,140
what they're looking at for California

26
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,450
and the title 24 process so with no

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:17,069
further ado I'll bring up Keith and we

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:19,969
can hear about the acronym soup good

29
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:24,658
afternoon everyone so I'll focus on the

30
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:26,489
HVAC standards activity and try to put a

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,530
little bit of a bow over the acronyms

32
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:31,500
and all the different standards that are

33
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,090
out there and so if we look at it from a

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,469
manufacturer's point of view really

35
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,560
being driven by two different

36
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,209
organizations the first one is a HRI

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,769
which is the trade association for all

38
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:43,109
the air conditioning and heating and

39
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:45,000
ventilating companies and then a ham

40
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:46,938
which is more the appliance and the

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,978
reason why these two become important is

42
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:51,779
for most of the air conditioning and and

43
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,719
and larger diamond fication systems

44
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,210
being used they're the HRI one but the

45
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,879
portable dehumidifier --zz fall under

46
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,039
the jurisdiction of the a ham ratings

47
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,780
and so we've got to make sure that we we

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,270
compensate and understand that there's

49
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,739
two different rating positions then

50
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:09,899
those are the professional societies

51
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:12,389
that we've already heard on the ASHRAE

52
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,360
and the a si B e which

53
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:16,829
we actually heard from Nadia just before

54
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,320
and I'll just kind of put a little bit

55
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:24,000
of explanation point on top of it within

56
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,620
HR I there is no plant type of standard

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,659
and everybody starts referring back to I

58
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,159
have an air conditioner I want an air

59
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,520
conditioning load and so that would be

60
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,109
the 340 360 but we don't have just an

61
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,780
air conditioning load we also have a

62
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,400
dehumidification load and guess what we

63
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,409
could look at the pool one and and look

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,539
at standard 910 and get a moisture

65
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:45,030
removal efficiency standard of pounds

66
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:47,039
per hour of condensate with a kilowatt

67
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,780
input but that really doesn't apply

68
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,299
because the temperatures and some of the

69
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,969
other elements aren't consistent and

70
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,920
then there's standard 920 which gets us

71
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,620
into the dedicated outside air systems

72
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,109
and that's a very complicated standard

73
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,120
because it's trying to handle all the

74
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,880
weather climactic conditions that

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,640
represented across really North America

76
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,859
and it actually rates at four different

77
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,319
conditions in the cooling

78
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,600
dehumidification mode and two different

79
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,949
conditions in the heating mode and so

80
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,009
when you talk about this multiple

81
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:22,019
standard multiple parameter type system

82
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:25,169
it gets a very complicated one and we've

83
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,540
just ended up our conversation after ten

84
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:29,458
years of trying to develop this code and

85
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,319
have finally got the Department of

86
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,390
Energy to sign off on it you're gonna be

87
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,729
hearing more about that particular code

88
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:37,979
if you're in the HVAC industry finally

89
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:41,099
here after ten years of work and and I

90
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:44,009
bring up the ten years work because none

91
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,599
of these happen overnight there is a lot

92
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,379
of work in developing the standards as

93
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,859
we go forward

94
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:52,319
so the a.m. actually has the seven zero

95
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,080
zero eight 2018 was the last the code

96
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,969
cycle for it's under the appliance the

97
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,810
interesting thing about this particular

98
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:03,270
code is all the units being tested don't

99
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,830
have any ductwork so there we call

100
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,260
freestanding they're just put in the

101
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,150
space and they blow out so when you look

102
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:11,819
at other systems that have to go through

103
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,400
ductwork it cannot apply to the a ham

104
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,469
standard because the the blowers and the

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,840
energy costs that they're doing and one

106
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:23,850
of the things that okay one of the

107
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,859
things that we need to understand and

108
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,720
the difference with that one as as

109
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,919
was just being talked a little bit

110
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,599
earlier by Nadia was the amount of duct

111
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,689
work and filters and other things that

112
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:39,060
you put on system equipment drives up

113
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:41,370
the requirement for the load when we

114
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,389
look at that a ham standard the fan has

115
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,490
no static pressure to go against so the

116
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:51,780
rating is much lower now they're using a

117
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,639
rating here at in SI units at 2.7 liters

118
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,529
per kilowatt hour and you could

119
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,538
translate that one over into pounds an

120
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:00,000
hour but the problem is there's no

121
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:03,000
ductwork here how we can apply the two

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,569
standards into one common platform as we

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,129
go forward within ASHRAE we've got two

124
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:09,060
different committees that are trying to

125
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:11,759
talk about it

126
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,280
2.2 is the plant and animal committee

127
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,080
which has just really taken on the

128
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,668
cannabis side of it and this is a very

129
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,310
very recent event they've only actually

130
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:23,389
met twice to have this conversation at

131
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:27,930
the trade show in Orlando this past

132
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:30,449
February they had standing room only at

133
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,098
two different events talking about this

134
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,840
particular standard so there's a lot of

135
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,639
interest in it a lot of people coming

136
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,008
together the other one is the large

137
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,050
building segment that kind of owns a

138
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:41,699
little bit of the related one and so

139
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,460
these two have to work together so

140
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:46,650
they're both trying to write a handbook

141
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:49,258
stand or to start to get preliminary

142
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:52,318
information out there of how you have to

143
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,819
size the HVAC equipment in this new

144
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,439
industry and so it's going to provide

145
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,060
the guidance to the engineering

146
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,250
community that are working with all the

147
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,019
other people in this area we're also

148
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,389
looking at getting some research money

149
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:05,968
put together and talk about the

150
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:08,129
evapotranspiration rate which is the

151
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:10,589
critical aspect to sizing the HVAC

152
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:12,900
equipment lighting load is one but

153
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:14,189
because of the cooling effect of it we

154
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,560
have to know how much is being

155
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:19,288
transpired otherwise we can't calculate

156
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,538
the load you can read all you want there

157
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:23,968
isn't a single documented research paper

158
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:25,528
that's going to say for cannabis this is

159
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,908
the type of rate that you have and we've

160
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:31,348
got to come to that conclusion if we

161
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:34,139
want right-sized equipment the a sa B E

162
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:35,579
is also working on it and they've got

163
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,620
two different standards that are

164
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,250
involved the first one is in the HVAC

165
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,410
side of it and they're kind of

166
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,480
looking at it from all the same elements

167
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,030
that ASHRAE would look at it but they're

168
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,819
trying to to do it and we've got to make

169
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:50,649
sure that we we stay in in concert with

170
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:52,899
both organizations and so they are

171
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:55,989
talking they have already published the

172
00:06:52,899 --> 00:07:01,569
s 642 which is the recommended standard

173
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:03,790
for the LED light type system and so

174
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:05,800
really what I'm saying right now there

175
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,760
is absolutely nothing out there to

176
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,560
define a standard for the HVAC units it

177
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,050
doesn't exist and if you were at the

178
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,220
code to conversation last night with the

179
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:19,810
title 24 people we just have to use some

180
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,550
loose verbage in these early days

181
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,670
because there's nothing we can reference

182
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,949
as it goes forward and and so with that

183
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:29,290
I guess it gives us a chance to kind of

184
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,810
organize our thoughts and get going at

185
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,550
the HRI spring meeting we're actually

186
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,410
going to be bringing it forward to look

187
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,419
at a development of a standard and

188
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,740
here's where my request is going to come

189
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:40,839
back to the rest of the people that

190
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,860
we're all in this room today is that we

191
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:46,329
have to come back and come up with a

192
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,669
rating standard which means I have to

193
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:51,009
have a temperature I have to have an RH

194
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:53,949
and as a single point going to be

195
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:56,079
acceptable to this industry do we need

196
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,629
multiple points that get weighted and

197
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,909
and so these are the type of decisions

198
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:03,219
that we need to come to feed the the

199
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,550
systems as we work on this standard and

200
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,340
I can already tell you that as it goes

201
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,930
we get federally regulated the

202
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:12,699
Department of Energy is then going to

203
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,500
take over the standard they've done it

204
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:17,409
every standard that we've done at a HRI

205
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,259
and it it matters to what's going to go

206
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,729
on I'm going to switch over because

207
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,569
there were some conversations the other

208
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:28,269
day on this whole refrigerant transition

209
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:32,379
what I can tell you is that the HVAC

210
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:37,000
industry is absolutely committed to

211
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:39,009
going to proper GWP low GWP rating

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,839
refrigerants it is moving forward

213
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:42,879
whether the federal government goes that

214
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,200
way or not now we know all the states

215
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,309
are starting to do their own little

216
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:51,250
thing along with it but we cannot move

217
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:53,139
faster than the research allows us to

218
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,179
look at it and the leading

219
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:58,360
candidates going for the large bulk of

220
00:08:55,179 --> 00:09:02,049
HVAC equipment will contain flammable

221
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,169
elements and all the building safety

222
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:06,849
code people have to sign off of this

223
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:08,949
California was a prime example where one

224
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,990
group was not allowing it actually

225
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,150
disallowing it the other group reporting

226
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,649
to the governor was promoting it it gets

227
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,970
very difficult to be able to put a piece

228
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:17,559
of equipment and where two different

229
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,070
people are saying you can or you can't

230
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:23,199
so this is going forward you're not

231
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:26,710
gonna see anything really come into the

232
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,950
industry until 2023 at the absolute

233
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:34,120
earliest my gut feel is it's gonna be

234
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:35,940
2024 or 2025 that the low GWP

235
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,590
refrigerants are gonna finally get

236
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,480
through all the design and research to

237
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,070
become part of the platform so the good

238
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,539
news is we're gonna get there the bad

239
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:49,300
news we're not gonna get there for a

240
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:53,980
couple more years Lexie okay I'm going

241
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:58,389
to shift gears just a little and I'm

242
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,490
gonna bring bring it from the standards

243
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:04,899
which are referred to in codes up to the

244
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:06,460
level of codes and I'm gonna go as a bit

245
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,199
of a broad brush here I'm looking in

246
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,420
large part at model codes at codes that

247
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,070
maybe transcend more than than one

248
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:13,839
jurisdiction because they're adopted by

249
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,150
several different jurisdictions and NBI

250
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,830
has been involved for for some years in

251
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:21,399
the development of national model codes

252
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,690
a little bit of background I'm not gonna

253
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,730
get too deep into anything because I

254
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,470
have what eight minutes here but a

255
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,360
little bit of background on why we are

256
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,730
even talking about building energy codes

257
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:35,470
in this context according to the do-e

258
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,180
they say energy codes save building

259
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,029
owners about five billion dollars a year

260
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:41,709
in energy cost and that's per year

261
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:44,230
obviously this is quite a bit more over

262
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,690
the lifetime of a building so they say

263
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,570
2010 to 2014 that 30-year span we're

264
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,400
looking at 126 billion dollars with a B

265
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,129
of energy cost savings to building

266
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:57,459
owners because we have codes in place

267
00:10:53,129 --> 00:11:00,580
and something like 245 coal plants worth

268
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,639
of carbon dioxide emissions avoided it

269
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,080
is critical that we think about when we

270
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,699
want to do this efficiency it's it's a

271
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,080
lot easier to do these kinds of project

272
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,970
when you build the building than it is

273
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,030
to go try to retrofit this stuff in

274
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,590
later so the the idea with an energy

275
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:17,679
code is is build it pretty good the

276
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:19,750
first time it sets the floor that is a

277
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,519
form of Quality Assurance for the people

278
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,870
who are going to be using that building

279
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,029
and the occupants of that building

280
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,490
whether they be plants or humans so we

281
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,470
want to have codes that achieve these

282
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,680
kinds of goals and we're pretty good at

283
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,480
it

284
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,579
reasonably broadly speaking we're pretty

285
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,700
good at it for buildings intended for

286
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,350
humans it's been a little bit of a

287
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,150
square peg round hole situation trying

288
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,040
to adapt these human centric codes to

289
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:47,110
plant centric buildings and and

290
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:50,529
occupancies the way building energy

291
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,870
codes work in the briefest nutshell it

292
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,850
sets the minimum efficiency requirement

293
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,690
for a building something that triggers

294
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:01,300
code right and it defines what I like to

295
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,130
say is a code defines the worst possible

296
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:05,109
building you can legally build you got

297
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:07,509
to do at least this much and then on

298
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,889
from there and it's a subset the energy

299
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:11,169
code is one of the several building

300
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:12,639
energy codes or building codes sorry you

301
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:14,469
know you got lighting you know you got

302
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:20,080
energy you got structural you got fire

303
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:22,509
you got water plumbing those are coming

304
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,040
from national model codes so there's

305
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:26,799
this organization the International Code

306
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:28,000
Council that for example one of the

307
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,709
things I do a lot is work with the

308
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,200
development of the International Energy

309
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:36,700
Conservation code IEC C which comes

310
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:39,070
under the ICC's ambit broadly and a

311
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,990
jurisdiction Colorado callable not

312
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,080
California Colorado Oregon everyone

313
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:46,690
thought California basically says we'll

314
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,950
take the 2018 version of the

315
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,690
International Energy Conservation code

316
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,670
we'll take the 2015 version we'll take

317
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,260
the 2021 version and then they make some

318
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:55,990
amendments they change things here and

319
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:58,120
there sometimes a lot sometimes just a

320
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,370
little but they have this common

321
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,169
framework that they're starting from so

322
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,779
one thing we have focused on over the

323
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:06,789
years is moving that national model code

324
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,769
forward so that as jurisdictions adopt

325
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:10,059
they have a better framework and we're

326
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,639
all dealing with something reasonably

327
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:17,649
consistent across the across the

328
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:20,578
marketplace now in indoor AG with

329
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:22,708
cannabis specifically you also have lice

330
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:23,938
requirements and some jurisdictions have

331
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,099
said well we're not going to do this

332
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:27,659
thing during the code through the code

333
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,879
maybe this doesn't really fall under

334
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:32,368
energy code but we can do it in a

335
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:33,659
licensing requirement scenario so now

336
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:36,749
you have things you got to do it to meet

337
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:39,028
code that can vary and maybe there are

338
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,619
also some of the elements that used to

339
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:42,239
be in an energy code or could

340
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:46,649
potentially be but they're actually part

341
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:48,239
of your license RIT very briefly the

342
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:49,649
idea with national model codes is to

343
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,629
provide a consistent framework but of

344
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:53,669
course all every state and lots of

345
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:55,769
jurisdictions sub state are on different

346
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:58,409
or in a different place with the

347
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:01,350
adoption so there's everything it's

348
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:03,719
probably pretty hard to read those those

349
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,259
captions down there but that's

350
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,420
everything from ASHRAE 90.1 2007 all the

351
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,399
way up to 2013 and of course there are

352
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:13,708
more versions coming out it's a three

353
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,328
year cycle going through here and then a

354
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:17,128
couple of states especially Arizona in

355
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:19,078
Colorado Colorado pretty relevant in

356
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:21,149
this market have a lot of local

357
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:24,149
adoptions so NBI for example helped

358
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:25,379
Boulder develop their energy code for

359
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:28,528
the last several years we wouldn't we've

360
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,819
been doing that so it's it's a

361
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:30,568
consistent framework but it's in

362
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:33,599
different places in different

363
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:35,368
jurisdictions around the country so I'm

364
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,499
gonna talk a little bit about what is in

365
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:38,489
this broad national model code framework

366
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:40,769
and I'm gonna start with lighting

367
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:45,689
because that's that's where we've we've

368
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:50,600
spent some effort MBI was successful in

369
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:53,129
moving through a proposal for the 2021

370
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,100
IEC see the model code that jurisdiction

371
00:14:53,129 --> 00:15:00,839
can choose to adopt and eventually many

372
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:03,778
of them will to say not less than 95% of

373
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,299
the luminaires light fixtures used for

374
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:08,548
plant growth and maintenance shall be at

375
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:11,610
least as efficient as 1.6 micromoles per

376
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:13,289
dual rated in accordance with the asabi

377
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,079
standard Mesabi actually has three

378
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:17,938
different standards dealing with this so

379
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:21,238
yeah you have to have a proper thing to

380
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:23,159
refer to here thank you wasabi - they

381
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:24,989
put together a good standard that's

382
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:28,798
something you can reference in a model

383
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:32,028
code so this was approved by the the

384
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:33,959
voters the which are cities States

385
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:37,620
Building Department official

386
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,670
etc for inclusion in the 2021 national

387
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,620
model code it's going to be a few years

388
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:44,569
before this filters down but what this

389
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:48,028
does is this gives a common framework

390
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,770
which as as we know isn't always exactly

391
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:51,750
the same thing and Kyle talked about

392
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:53,429
that a little bit about how it's not

393
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,379
always going exactly this way but there

394
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:57,208
is this common framework and a baseline

395
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,360
right you can still do double-ended HPS

396
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:02,039
that's about 1.7 micromoles per Joule

397
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,339
but probably not single-ended and not

398
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:08,099
fluorescent so it's a it's a you must be

399
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,870
at least this good to play it also gives

400
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,028
someone like a utility someone running

401
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,919
say a utility program a way to say well

402
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:16,309
here's a reasonable baseline maybe if

403
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,588
you get a product that's on the

404
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:21,750
qualified products list from the design

405
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:23,459
lights consortium here's the difference

406
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,490
between how good that one is and where

407
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:28,409
the the code is so you know sets the

408
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,620
floor puts us all in a common

409
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:34,799
understanding and uses this metric let's

410
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:38,159
talk about HVAC how about where our

411
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,419
national model codes in HVAC and

412
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:45,409
dehumidification what do we have in the

413
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:48,389
model codes not much nothing there yet

414
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:50,730
that's not to say this topic is never

415
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:54,179
represented in codes and it's definitely

416
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:56,490
not to say that codes are not relevant

417
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,019
in terms of HVAC systems going into

418
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,930
indoor AG or into horticultural

419
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,730
facilities because you you do have to

420
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:04,740
pay attention to codes in terms of HVAC

421
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,679
when you put a put a facility together

422
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,390
design a system all that stuff it's not

423
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,019
really in the national model codes but

424
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,910
it is a relevant concern so why why is

425
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,049
this a challenge and I mentioned earlier

426
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,759
there's a little bit of a square peg

427
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:19,259
round hole situation when we try to take

428
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,869
these codes that were originally built

429
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:23,818
for humans and adopt them for plants or

430
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:26,669
for facility's intended to to grow

431
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:28,289
plants well as we've been hearing

432
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,800
several times through this conference

433
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:33,509
there are differences in creating

434
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:36,178
conditions in a space that are ideal for

435
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:38,569
plant growth dehumidification is a huge

436
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:40,740
piece of that and and I'm glad to hear

437
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:43,918
as Keith mentioned that there are

438
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,808
efforts to create consistent metrics for

439
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,080
these dehumidification systems and maybe

440
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:49,028
we will end up in a place

441
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:51,480
we're kind of like for lighting I'll go

442
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:55,000
back a couple slides where we have this

443
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,450
generally consistent oh it's over there

444
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,038
this generally consistent approach where

445
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,419
we say here's you know here's the basic

446
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,808
efficiency be at least this good and off

447
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:04,090
you go

448
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:05,349
maybe with some good metrics on

449
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,579
dehumidification there'll be something

450
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:08,889
along those lines right but we're not

451
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:10,928
there yet today and that's probably fine

452
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,880
because there's enormous variability

453
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,769
between facilities between practices

454
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,980
which makes it hard to define the

455
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:19,750
baseline so we're faced with some

456
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,778
challenges and opportunities as we try

457
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:25,569
to define consistent code frameworks in

458
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:27,730
the national model code in the ways

459
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:29,558
jurisdiction my jurisdiction might set

460
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,849
up their own codes and their licensing

461
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,490
regulations right because they can act

462
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:39,490
kind of the same way I'll just highlight

463
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:42,190
a couple of these here one question of

464
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,980
course what is the baseline is is a

465
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,200
pretty important piece it is not always

466
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,819
clear where we're starting from if

467
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,730
you're running an incentive program or

468
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:53,619
or as a jurisdiction what is good

469
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,730
practice and Derrick and his team at RI

470
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:56,798
have done some really good work in

471
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:59,409
defining best practices on lighting and

472
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,210
HVAC both there are some places where

473
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:03,010
the code touches these facilities that

474
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,380
can be can lead to unintended

475
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:07,480
consequences or or can lead to some

476
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,340
challenges for example if you've got a

477
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,829
facility with a ton of indoor loads

478
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:13,980
lights dehumidification and it's

479
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:17,019
producing a lot of heat

480
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,548
should it be very well insulated or is

481
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:21,009
that insulation just keeping the heat in

482
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:23,740
and leading to more energy use so you

483
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:25,450
need to deal with the code may say

484
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,759
insulate your envelope the code may also

485
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:30,278
say put on an air site economizer so you

486
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,470
can bring in outside air but in Oregon

487
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:34,839
for example in a few facilities there

488
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,278
are folks that have had to do that tried

489
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,168
to get a variance didn't get that

490
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:39,638
variance so they built their facility

491
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:42,190
they put in the economizers they had to

492
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:44,709
put in the first thing they did weld it

493
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,360
shut yeah there's an economizer on the

494
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,100
roof but it ain't doing much right so

495
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:50,528
that's that's really an unintended

496
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:52,538
consequence of using a code that was

497
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:54,579
built for human occupancy for plant

498
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:56,259
occupancy so there are there are some

499
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:59,048
challenges there I like to say in terms

500
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:00,369
of lighting lumens err for humans and I

501
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:04,210
think having a

502
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:06,539
PBF PBE photosynthetic photon photonic

503
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,440
efficiency of efficacy excuse me

504
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,319
provides a good way for us to think

505
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,519
about efficiency or efficacy in in terms

506
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,960
of lighting fixtures and that's

507
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,180
something that people in this room I

508
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,090
think have a pretty good handle on in

509
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,950
the case of Massachusetts and now

510
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,569
Illinois we've got a different animal

511
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,549
going on which is watts of lighting per

512
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:26,470
square foot of canopy so now you've got

513
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:28,569
these two different approaches that that

514
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,740
are a bit different and are introducing

515
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:32,019
I think something of a challenge at

516
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,140
least have the the ability to but the

517
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:36,940
main point I want to make is that

518
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,620
broadly speaking we want to move codes

519
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,750
forward because we want these facilities

520
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:42,669
to be built well both in terms of energy

521
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,549
in terms of greenhouse gas impacts in

522
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,019
terms of getting good facilities for the

523
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:48,220
people who are you know procuring them

524
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:50,710
right the people the owners the

525
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,819
operators and doing their job these

526
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,110
things are not there to save energy

527
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:54,519
they're there to produce plants but we

528
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:56,949
want them to do that in a responsible

529
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,359
way so we want good code approaches we

530
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,029
want consistent code approaches so the

531
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:03,549
market knows what to do but we all have

532
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:05,139
some thinking to do about how do we come

533
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:06,669
up with the right approaches define the

534
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,070
right metrics whether that's for

535
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:11,259
lighting various components of HVAC or

536
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:15,490
some kind of integrated everything -

537
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:17,319
holistic solutions great we need to

538
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,259
think about how to actually do that for

539
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:22,178
indoor horticulture specifically so with

540
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:31,629
that we'll be onto Kyle and then

541
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:33,730
discussion thank you all right thanks

542
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,350
Lexi and I want to thank everyone that

543
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,839
joined the codes discussion last night

544
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:40,029
it was definitely lively and it's just

545
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:43,689
amazing what happens when you schedule

546
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:45,730
it after happy hour so thank you all

547
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:50,230
that joined so I'm going to talk about

548
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:54,160
the statewide utilities team for title

549
00:21:50,230 --> 00:22:00,700
24 part six of the California Building

550
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:03,360
Code okay so why do codes matter into

551
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,860
our cultivation is expanding and

552
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,049
particularly in the urban areas and and

553
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:11,169
we're expected to see I mean 390

554
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:12,639
gigawatt hours by 2021 so that's that's

555
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,200
a large load and that's just in

556
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,509
California

557
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,880
so you know the proposed codes are

558
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:22,960
designed to save growers costs by

559
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,020
reducing energy energy use so you know

560
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,960
here we just have a quick example and

561
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:30,910
you know looking at if a facility had

562
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,049
244 lights on flower you know you're

563
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:37,630
looking at annual cost savings of 83,000

564
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:39,339
you know veg looking at upwards of you

565
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:44,380
know a hundred hundred plus thousand

566
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:47,889
dollars annually savings so California

567
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,720
building energy efficiency standards the

568
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,690
the energy code is on a three-year cycle

569
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,680
so right now we're working on what's the

570
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:59,440
2022 energy code so it's just barely

571
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,930
2020 so we're a couple years you know

572
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,940
out and that won't take effect till

573
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:10,240
January 1 2023 so it is a regular

574
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:13,240
process in California and it's on a

575
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,789
pretty regular cycle with formalized

576
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,690
steps that allow for a stakeholder

577
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:21,819
engagement review of the proposed codes

578
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,340
and all the documentation that's

579
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:26,619
associated with it so a little bit

580
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:28,269
different than some of the legislature

581
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:30,009
that's gone through and you know

582
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:32,379
different states this is a formal

583
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:37,950
process that's you know on a rolling

584
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,950
basis for the you know the energy code

585
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:47,140
okay so controlled environment

586
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:51,490
horticulture you know this proposal will

587
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:54,820
impact newly constructed warehouses in

588
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:57,190
addition to major renovations so you

589
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:59,619
know we're not going to tell a grower

590
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:02,170
that's growing right now you know as of

591
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:03,939
January 1 2023 switch all your lights

592
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,460
out it's going to be someone who is

593
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:10,360
building new or putting on a major

594
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,799
addition or a major renovation you know

595
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:14,409
we're looking at more than just cannabis

596
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:18,490
so we are looking at you know vegetable

597
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:22,269
crops microgreens basil lettuce tomatoes

598
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:25,400
flowers we have added greenhouse

599
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:28,670
lighting and greenhouse envelope as

600
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,320
proposed measures the greenhouse

601
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,550
envelope I will touch on that because

602
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,169
that's a little bit different than some

603
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:35,180
of the other measures it's actually more

604
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,960
of a codes cleanup because what we've

605
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:41,779
run into is some growers meet the

606
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,880
definition of a conditioned space by

607
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:45,740
having mechanical a/c you know some of

608
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,170
those type of like sealed greenhouses

609
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,910
that we heard about earlier and they're

610
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,620
having a lot of trouble meeting

611
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:55,970
compliance because they're triggering

612
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:57,709
the envelope portion of Title 24 so in

613
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,569
that envelope portion there's nothing

614
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,279
specific to greenhouses so they're

615
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:03,069
having to meet basically like a

616
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,779
warehouse or something like that

617
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:08,059
envelope so as you know that's really

618
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:10,220
not feasible with regular greenhouse

619
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:13,730
materials so we want to make that so it

620
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:19,730
is you know it's it's possible to comply

621
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:22,400
with okay so the statewide utility codes

622
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,930
and standards team so they actively

623
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,670
support the California Energy Commission

624
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:31,009
in developing these codes this is a you

625
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:34,250
know congregation of all the i/o use in

626
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:36,140
California and they're really trying to

627
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,519
make they're trying to produce energy

628
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:42,560
savings through feasible enforceable

629
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,660
cost-effective and non proprietary codes

630
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,500
so those are really important you know

631
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,080
we don't want to propose something

632
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:53,869
that's not cost-effective or that is

633
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:56,480
overly burdensome for the growing okay

634
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:59,209
so the overall goal here is to provide

635
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,970
the information needed so that the

636
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:05,539
Energy Commission can make an informed

637
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:07,910
decision on how to set a code so that's

638
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:10,269
energy and demand impacts cost

639
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:13,550
effectiveness technical feasibility

640
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:15,559
market impacts crop quality and

641
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:17,569
productivity you know we're getting out

642
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,059
of the human space so it is important to

643
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:22,309
think of you know okay this is a process

644
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:24,019
and we want to make sure that anything

645
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:28,750
that we propose isn't going to hurt that

646
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:31,099
process so suggested code language

647
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,109
compliance and enforcement you know how

648
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:34,059
are we going to make sure that what

649
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:37,099
we're

650
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:41,980
recommending is actually done and done

651
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:45,740
properly so yeah

652
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:47,900
okay so here's some key dates for the

653
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:50,180
controlled environment horticulture

654
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,730
measure and I do have some Flyers that

655
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,500
you guys can take after so I'll have

656
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,529
those out after this

657
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:00,950
so April 16th is our next stakeholder

658
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:03,319
public stakeholder meeting you'll see at

659
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,120
the end of this there's a link to you

660
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:08,659
know how to sign up for that and and

661
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:11,869
register so I say you know I hope

662
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:15,230
everyone will join and definitely give

663
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:17,569
your feedback draft case report will be

664
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,849
published the case report is really our

665
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:24,859
recommendations and documentation of

666
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:27,589
what went into all this research so that

667
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:29,959
will be published May 15th on title 24

668
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:32,689
stakeholders calm and that's a really

669
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,720
good resource for just anything as far

670
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,160
as updates on on the code process and

671
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,259
you can go and click and look at

672
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,630
controlled environment horticulture and

673
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,579
it'll give you an email

674
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:46,460
you know mailing lists specific to that

675
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:49,329
measure so any major things that happen

676
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:53,930
to that measure you'll get you can email

677
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:55,519
final case report and then after we do

678
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:59,360
that part it goes to the Energy

679
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:01,940
Commission and they have a series of you

680
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:05,990
know public public stakeholder meetings

681
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:09,259
and then next year in April 20-21 is

682
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:12,049
when the actual adoption of the

683
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:16,750
standards will will happen and then

684
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:19,549
January 1 2023 is the effective date

685
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,109
okay so looking at the particular sub

686
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:22,609
measures that we have and I know we're

687
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:24,139
running low on time so I'm going to go a

688
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:27,759
little bit quick but leave time for

689
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:31,150
questions after we're looking at a

690
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:34,359
horticultural minimum lighting efficacy

691
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:37,300
dehumidification efficiency

692
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:40,159
environmental and irrigation controls

693
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:41,299
circulation fan minimum performance and

694
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,170
then the greenhouse lighting in

695
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,169
greenhouse envelope

696
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:52,130
okay so looking at horticultural

697
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:56,570
lighting efficacy we're looking at using

698
00:28:52,130 --> 00:29:01,160
a product efficacy so PPE in specifying

699
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:02,990
a certain micro moles per Joule and one

700
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,540
you know kind of some things that came

701
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,579
out of last night were you know helpful

702
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:10,700
in kind of modifying this a little bit

703
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:13,339
so there was a suggestion for doing a

704
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:16,490
certain percentage of the wattage to

705
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:19,480
leave some exemptions for you know

706
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:22,490
particular purpose lights like for

707
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:29,420
propagation or other things like that so

708
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:31,809
that will likely be built in and yeah so

709
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:39,170
then we also have kind of some typical

710
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:41,059
product types here and then let's okay

711
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:44,050
here's some existing codes that exist

712
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:47,019
we've got in Massachusetts Illinois

713
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:49,269
Denver and Washington State

714
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:51,829
Massachusetts in Illinois I going with a

715
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:54,879
lighting power density Denver and

716
00:29:51,829 --> 00:30:01,970
Washington state going with a PPE

717
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:04,430
similar to what i ec c is doing so and

718
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:07,549
the nice thing about PPE is that it does

719
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:10,330
you know it there's not as many issues

720
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:13,819
with how are you going to define canopy

721
00:30:10,329 --> 00:30:15,889
you know the loopholes that growers can

722
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:18,349
have to kind of you know space their

723
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:21,050
plants out and do things that we really

724
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:22,490
aren't trying to get them to do with the

725
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:26,659
code but it's ways they can work around

726
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:28,099
it for dehumidification there was some

727
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,690
really good discussion on this last

728
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:31,399
night too

729
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,740
you know we've been wanting to establish

730
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,380
a minimum moisture removal efficiency

731
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:39,200
but based on you know where the industry

732
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:41,810
is at right now and what's available for

733
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,140
standards this may not be feasible this

734
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:46,990
code cycle but Colorado actually just

735
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,809
put through some

736
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:52,839
standards for dehumidification equipment

737
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:55,950
that would be a good start right now so

738
00:30:52,839 --> 00:31:01,109
specifies you know several different

739
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:05,289
acceptable methods of dehumidification

740
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:08,679
so we'll we'll be modifying this and

741
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:11,440
here's a couple of current standards

742
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:14,350
Santa Rosa having a ventilation rate

743
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:19,000
requirement Illinois with their HVAC

744
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:21,990
requirement circulation fan performance

745
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,679
so this is to do a minimum CFM per watt

746
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:29,289
and this is one that as Nadia pointed

747
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,860
out is is definitely a lower priority as

748
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:38,558
far as energy savings but the idea is to

749
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:40,719
kind of create a minimum floor so in

750
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:43,058
green house lighting efficacy very

751
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,049
similar to the warehouse just you know

752
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:49,450
in in greenhouse facilities as well the

753
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:52,240
other measures dehumidification controls

754
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:54,910
circulation fans will not be applicable

755
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,950
to greenhouses just into our facilities

756
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,960
so that's an important distinction to

757
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,460
make

758
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,880
and then environmental and irrigation

759
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:06,250
controls a lot of facilities might have

760
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,530
most or all of these so this is really

761
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:11,230
again trying to set a minimum floor make

762
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:13,259
sure all newly constructed facilities

763
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:20,349
have you know temperature humidity

764
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:22,420
controls irrigation controls yeah and we

765
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:25,269
want everyone here to get involved so

766
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:28,150
sign up for the email updates the second

767
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:29,769
public stakeholder meeting thank you to

768
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,690
everyone that already has given your

769
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:34,960
feedback last night was very productive

770
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:37,210
and you know I I really thank everyone

771
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,279
for staying that extra hour because you

772
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:42,640
know it was I was happy to get people

773
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,769
for one hour so too was great yeah and

774
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,490
you can send comments on code language

775
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:50,920
to info at title 24 stakeholders and

776
00:32:48,490 --> 00:33:01,579
copy myself on there

777
00:32:50,920 --> 00:33:04,070
great alright thank you thanks so much

778
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:06,799
Kyle so we have a few minutes for

779
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:10,609
questions if anybody has any questions

780
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,159
for our panel a great presentations

781
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:15,079
thank you I noticed a little bit of

782
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:19,790
slippage in language over the course of

783
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:20,990
this event and so controlled environment

784
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,000
horticulture versus controlled

785
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,799
environment agriculture

786
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I don't those are small details or maybe

787
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,609
they're big details maybe you could

788
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,019
comment on that and also to keep the

789
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:33,019
question on you know are we using the

790
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:34,420
right terminology when we say HVAC in

791
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:37,809
controlled environment

792
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,810
horticulture agriculture

793
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:48,640
I'll take the second one first yes we

794
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,779
have to use the HVAC because as we look

795
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,610
at what these standards are going to be

796
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:53,889
it's going to be the eating food of

797
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:56,529
cooling ventilation unfortunately

798
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,900
there's not the D part of that but it's

799
00:33:56,529 --> 00:34:01,029
implied within the industry so I think

800
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,320
we don't want to remove it we want to

801
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:04,740
keep calling because it covers all those

802
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,740
segments

803
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:12,880
I can address the first part so

804
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:14,679
controlled environment horticulture we

805
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:18,970
had a couple iterations of what the name

806
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,940
should be there was CEA is another

807
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:24,159
acronym that the energy commute

808
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,829
Commission uses frequently so there was

809
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,730
a conflict there and it was in a

810
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:32,739
definition that seemed to really get

811
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,990
narrow in on the facilities we were

812
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,309
looking at so I I do understand that

813
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,129
there's you know a little bit of

814
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:41,019
industry terminology differences there

815
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:55,119
but there were there were some specific

816
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:57,039
reasons we had to go with that - he said

817
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,539
technically agriculture includes animals

818
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,300
and that was one of the reasons on the

819
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:04,179
national model code level that that IECC

820
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,800
21 20 21 proposal is indoor

821
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:07,509
horticultural lights not just

822
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,130
agriculture specifically for plant

823
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:13,660
applications although it also says it a

824
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:16,539
little further down Kyle is flora

825
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:18,369
culture in ceh is their flower

826
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:21,279
production in California as it covered

827
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:24,309
under horticulture and that double-ended

828
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,250
HPS lamp efficacy that shows up in the

829
00:35:24,309 --> 00:35:29,110
goe 2017 report I don't know if that's

830
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,570
bear lamp but it's certainly not fixture

831
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:34,539
efficacy the highest I've ever seen is

832
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:36,460
like 1.7 - when I tested it so it seems

833
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:39,909
sort of like an outlier compared to the

834
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:43,360
others sure yeah so thanks to address

835
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:46,779
the first part as far as flora culture

836
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:50,230
yes so all crops are considered you know

837
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:53,140
for for indoor and for greenhouse

838
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:56,349
I imagine the greenhouses will have the

839
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:58,659
higher you know percentage of the flora

840
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:00,460
called culture so that will be you know

841
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:02,619
just the lighting measure and the

842
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:05,559
envelope and the envelope is only for

843
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:08,829
conditioned greenhouses so the

844
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:12,250
definition of conditioned in title 24

845
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:15,750
part 6 is 5 BTUs per hour per square

846
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:18,579
foot of mechanical cooling so not

847
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:20,619
evaporative cooling but like AC and then

848
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:22,949
10 BTUs per hour per square foot of

849
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:22,949
heated

850
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:31,588
so I was wondering if were you know

851
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:34,890
since we're expanding title 24 and we're

852
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:39,298
expanding building codes to nominally

853
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:41,940
cover horticulture are we now

854
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:44,009
considering that all greenhouses are now

855
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,048
going to be real buildings with real

856
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:49,200
codes about how they're built and and

857
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:55,288
that we're going to be going down that

858
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:57,389
path as well and as a kind of follow-up

859
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:59,730
question to that are we also looking at

860
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:01,500
other types of industrial facilities

861
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,838
like car plants and are we gonna have a

862
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,630
special code for car plants and a

863
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:08,400
special code for paint factories and a

864
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,910
special code for all of these other

865
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:15,269
kinds of buildings that are really

866
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:18,868
purpose-built and that might not have

867
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:21,150
that same level of customer ignorant

868
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:24,869
when they get sold or when they get

869
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:28,920
rented sure that's a great question so

870
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:32,220
as far as I'll start with you know the

871
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,769
different processes so there are some

872
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:37,798
processes that are already covered

873
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:42,389
within title 24 part six refrigerated

874
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:46,159
warehouses compressed air parking lot

875
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:49,379
Lighting's and there's a few others so

876
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:51,449
that may grow but this isn't the first

877
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:54,358
time that that's been done it's been

878
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:56,429
done since 2008 so there are several

879
00:37:54,358 --> 00:38:01,679
other processes that are involved in

880
00:37:56,429 --> 00:38:03,538
that as far as you know how deep the

881
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,868
Energy Commission will dive into

882
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:10,309
greenhouses in subsequent code cycles

883
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:12,720
I can't necessarily comment on on that

884
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:14,609
you know as far as what we're looking at

885
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,098
now with green house lighting and the

886
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:20,699
envelope you know that's that's as far

887
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:22,559
as we will go in this code cycle you

888
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,068
know I just can't comment any further on

889
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:30,690
that

890
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:34,440
I brought it up the other night but how

891
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:37,798
would you see the policing of something

892
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,659
under the DLC requirement being you know

893
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:42,420
anything let's say it's at one point six

894
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:46,949
anything between one point six and a DLC

895
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,949
minimum because there's no independent

896
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:51,809
third party looking at that and yeah if

897
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:54,778
you can just speak to any preliminary

898
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:57,390
thoughts on that yeah that's a great

899
00:38:54,778 --> 00:38:59,130
great question Brady so this is you know

900
00:38:57,389 --> 00:39:01,798
something we're currently considering

901
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:05,039
how to deal with that you know one one

902
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:07,559
possible solution is to characterize the

903
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:10,559
existing incumbent technologies that

904
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:12,839
that fall you know below that that

905
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:16,170
threshold and iron on the DLC qualified

906
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:18,420
products list you know so that that

907
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,869
could be one and then adding a table to

908
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,798
the the building codes so that there is

909
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:28,289
accepted you know PPE ratings for those

910
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:30,509
particular technologies there there is

911
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:32,039
some complexity to that because you're

912
00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:34,338
gonna have to look at you know some

913
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:37,079
different variations of reflectors and

914
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:39,328
you know of course single-ended versus

915
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:40,680
double-ended i I see those is almost a

916
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:43,048
different fixture even though they can

917
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:45,958
both be high pressure sodium and then

918
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:48,958
also making sure those are well vetted

919
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:50,548
with the industries so you know making

920
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:53,399
sure that those are industry accepted

921
00:39:50,548 --> 00:39:56,309
members so that's that's one possible

922
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,459
method independent testing is another

923
00:39:56,309 --> 00:40:03,559
that's got its own stickiness to it and

924
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:06,719
so a couple possible solutions

925
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:09,550
all right there's at least a standard to

926
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,960
test to at this point

927
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,200
all right great thank you let's give a

928
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:21,829
hand to our panel

929
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:21,829
[Applause]
