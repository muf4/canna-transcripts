1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,660
topic that I spent some time discussing

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,849
with folks is what happens to a market

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,800
that was medical only and when adult use

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,359
rolls out right and so what we've seen

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,960
which I find very very interesting is

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:19,169
when all of a sudden anxiety or chronic

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,429
pain or lack of appetite doesn't become

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,300
a qualifying condition and you actually

9
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:26,160
have to prove a need for for a medical

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,679
card that the product landscape changes

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,149
you know completely yeah right me

12
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,829
because all them all the taxes are being

13
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,149
made on the adult use side and so that's

14
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:34,890
where you see all the super high potency

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,270
flour go through a lot of the edibles

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,909
and then when you find in a medical side

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,609
is a lot more topical applications is a

18
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:43,319
lot more maybe inhalers things like that

19
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,850
is that something you seen as well

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,469
California I think it's a good example

21
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,920
on how that switched and it switched

22
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:55,109
from the the medical wherever it is like

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,789
medical medical medical and now it's

24
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:58,948
recreational and that's like well now I

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,649
don't have to right now I can go back to

26
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:03,390
just you know recreational right

27
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,368
wouldn't without having a medical excuse

28
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,469
my only concern what something like that

29
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:10,618
is taxation yep

30
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:13,079
taxation will actually drive people yep

31
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,909
either back to the medical or back to

32
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,590
the black market was even worse yeah I

33
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,140
know and we've we've totally seen

34
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,650
exactly that happen I mean you know

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,549
everyone the taxation in Colorado we saw

36
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,900
that the gap between what taxes are

37
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,250
being paid for medical and what taxes

38
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,659
are being paid for adult use we're

39
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,299
actually pretty good because what

40
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,310
happened was you're finding people who

41
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,470
don't need that card willing to pay the

42
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,750
taxes to go into a adult you shop and

43
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,400
find a product they need and the state

44
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,959
is incentivized to make sure they do so

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,460
because they make more tax revenue on

46
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,438
those individuals but those who really

47
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,169
need help are able to go into their

48
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,489
medical provider and you know honestly

49
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,009
see a product line that's much more

50
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:54,658
tailored for them and what they need so

51
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,688
I know we talked about like the CBD

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,579
being the entry point yep for non

53
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:01,978
cannabis consumers yeah I see the

54
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,899
medical market being the same as CBD at

55
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,599
the state level I completely agree

56
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,780
yeah medical is a way for a state to

57
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,489
start and like very indirectly get into

58
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,289
the market absolutely then transition

59
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,049
over to record

60
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:17,000
yeah and it's basically it's it's proof

61
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:19,430
to the public that the sky is not gonna

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,930
fall true the minute we legalize right

63
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,549
that we're gonna go to do this you're

64
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,469
gonna wake up tomorrow and everything's

65
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:26,150
gonna be fine your neighbors aren't

66
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:30,469
gonna be like all walking around stoned

67
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:33,819
all the time yeah I mean look we've all

68
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:36,919
had those friends yeah where you go out

69
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:38,509
doesn't matter have a good time maybe

70
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:41,030
you have a drink or two but there's

71
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:43,370
always that one friend that potentially

72
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,098
has one too many yeah absolutely

73
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:49,459
yeah and it becomes hell at the other

74
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:51,919
night so for those people that think

75
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:53,810
like Oh cannabis cannabis it's a simple

76
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:58,098
question like at the end of the night

77
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:00,920
and we take two segments one friend that

78
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:03,318
drinks too much yeah and one friend that

79
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:04,488
consumes too much cannabis which one do

80
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:05,719
you want to deal with it the end oh my

81
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,628
god I'd much rather deal with a guy who

82
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,930
was too high right he's gonna raid your

83
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:11,658
fridge

84
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,650
yeah eat your Twinkies maybe to you know

85
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,780
ask you for you to take him a

86
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,010
jack-in-the-box or even better maybe

87
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,959
he's just gonna order through door -

88
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:19,098
zaps and get his food and then pass out

89
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,539
in your couch pass out of your couch

90
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:22,280
it's gonna be good absolutely he's gonna

91
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,539
wake up feeling good the next day right

92
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,090
unlike the other friend who's gonna be

93
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:28,909
in health yeah absolutely and and that's

94
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,259
I think that's that's a big thing to

95
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,120
understand from a consumption

96
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:37,068
perspective that now people

97
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,900
misunderstand about cannabis ya know

98
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:40,369
it's and I think you know I think a lot

99
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,430
of it is you mentioned this earlier that

100
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,579
the average individual will not fess up

101
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,989
to being a consumer they won't when when

102
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:50,209
confronted with a stranger asking them

103
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:52,759
right and so for me I've always tried to

104
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,098
do everything I can to be very forward

105
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:57,108
and open about my consumption true with

106
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:58,698
my family with my friends with other

107
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:00,769
professionals and the stores because I

108
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:03,019
think we're guys like us who have been

109
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:04,129
professionals for a very long time we're

110
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:05,329
the first ones through the wall right

111
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:07,250
were the first ones to be in this

112
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,260
industry and say hey guys this really

113
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,989
isn't a big deal no it's not it really

114
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:13,399
isn't a big deal you know we've consumed

115
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:15,019
together at events and it's like hey

116
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,970
well we can still function again we're

117
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,199
consume responsibly right it's no

118
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,489
different than having a drink at the end

119
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,030
of a day of a conference or whatever it

120
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,858
might be

121
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,769
and the more people see and I see this

122
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,959
with my parents as well right I love to

123
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:29,919
use my parents as an example you know

124
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:32,239
immigrants from Costa Rica very wary of

125
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,290
legal guidelines you know don't want to

126
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,110
be on the wrong side of the law for

127
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,310
anything that was a fun conversation to

128
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,900
tell them when I first got into the

129
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,040
industry right but then again I've

130
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:41,539
always been the problem child so they

131
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,740
figured I was gonna be the one hand

132
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,720
doing that sort of thing anyway

133
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,210
yeah same here yeah but then it started

134
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,380
with me and they were like well yeah

135
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:51,199
that he would try anything

136
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:53,269
so whatever but then my sister started

137
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,110
asking me for advice on on what to do

138
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:56,930
and I started giving her some

139
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,520
recommendations and it helped her with

140
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,800
some conditions that she had and I think

141
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,779
between my sister and myself both openly

142
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,759
consuming and my parents seeing this and

143
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:07,219
just being around it more and realizing

144
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,889
hey this really isn't a big deal at all

145
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,240
right it's it's it's like it allows

146
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:13,699
people to get to let their guard down a

147
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,490
little bit and if they see somebody who

148
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:18,560
they trust consuming and then realizing

149
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,329
oh you know he's not going crazy right

150
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,550
now maybe this is something there's

151
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:23,418
something to this I think that's you

152
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,860
know that's a step in the right

153
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:26,449
direction and that's how we'll get more

154
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,560
and more people to be on on the right

155
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:33,430
side of this topic yeah I I don't I

156
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,430
don't disagree with you there

157
