1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,699
I talk about me even though even if I'm

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,980
not talking me too

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,289
you know like I was hoping for hope I

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,719
hope she's doing good and like those

5
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:18,589
things for our friends and then when we

6
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,789
see each other like we get we're like oh

7
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:23,070
man I was thinking about you but I

8
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,570
didn't tell you but like I was yeah yeah

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,179
and then when we get together too many

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,310
or never apart it's so good

11
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,198
I feel like hopes like this is I think I

12
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,299
really do care about you so much

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,039
I do think actually then I've seen you

14
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,308
at different stages of your life and

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:41,969
that's right so great is like hope is

16
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:43,229
like on her peak theme and like seeing

17
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,170
that like uprize

18
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,759
and like all just peaks and valleys cuz

19
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,920
like you've seen mine I'm like I'm not

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:54,259
hot less getting divorced you know or

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,980
whatever seeing that and being able to

22
00:00:54,259 --> 00:01:02,250
love their rise because you could you

23
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:05,338
could inspire your friends to do what's

24
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,188
in their heart but nobody can do

25
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:11,280
anything but you like yourself and like

26
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:14,339
seeing like her being inspired and like

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:19,650
being inspired by her own fuel is the

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,659
shit but my dragging me down I want to

29
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,509
be around and with people that are

30
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:29,310
genuine - is why I love her actually you

31
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:32,489
genuine genuine and passionate I have no

32
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,579
doubt that she turned on the whole what

33
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:39,359
do you need what is the mom yeah I was

34
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,709
mom and I was like man I haven't had my

35
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,349
kids to take care of for two whole days

36
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:49,258
just yes

37
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:52,349
ah well what right yeah so I am seen a

38
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,200
talk that Jane's given I think it was a

39
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:58,228
year ago now yeah and so and it was very

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,939
extraction focused this particular talk

41
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:04,829
what grabbed me about it was it was a

42
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:07,228
lot of buildup into what makes great

43
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,649
extraction is good product what you put

44
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:13,250
in matters and then not just to stop not

45
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,919
just to say that and stop but to go into

46
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,580
how do we know what is good that we're

47
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,149
putting in

48
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:25,709
starting with seeds and clones and then

49
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:32,400
the pros and cons of those and then the

50
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:35,090
hash tag give a shit and it speaks to my

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,489
heart because I swear like a sailor

52
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,170
because I just well and this is just who

53
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:44,009
I am and it's how I grew up and it

54
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:46,169
doesn't always have to be the most

55
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:47,969
scientific words to drive a point home

56
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:50,309
it can be very direct and

57
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:52,199
straightforward and it's like look if

58
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,789
you give a shit means you're gonna pay

59
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,349
attention to what the plants and the

60
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,709
crops are saying and I'm gonna give a

61
00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:01,469
shit when I'm buying those finished

62
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,900
products and making the products that I

63
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:05,719
love and that drives my business yeah

64
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,260
and then now seeing you become a grower

65
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:12,090
yeah how has your given a shit actually

66
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:14,429
changed because were you very I mean you

67
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,099
I know always loved the plan but has it

68
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,920
changed even more so being a grower now

69
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:23,129
well I think it's brought it a little

70
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,169
more into that commercial wavelength

71
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:28,590
that I wouldn't have thought of before

72
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:31,089
because I didn't it was so focused on

73
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:36,580
the quality of the medicine from

74
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:42,878
before that's and so I'm in Colorado and

75
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:44,920
California yes so for me to be able to

76
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,139
say okay I've got my little plants in my

77
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,059
little backyard and and I'm gonna have

78
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:52,029
this one that I grow for this friend

79
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,680
that suffers with this ailment and I'm

80
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,769
gonna do this one and then this is like

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:01,060
because it's freakin awesome right and

82
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:03,969
stuff like that so seeing me going from

83
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:07,060
12 plants to right now there's 1,200

84
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:09,759
plants in the ground which is a very

85
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:13,780
indicative of how our industry went from

86
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:18,189
exactly I mean very feeling that more

87
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:22,329
than hearing that and what has happened

88
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:26,649
was having to have the huge pre-planning

89
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:30,279
of where every plant will go and how

90
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:34,000
that plant goes into the ground and what

91
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,709
that plant has to be fed and multiply it

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,259
out instead of like well I'm gonna make

93
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:42,819
this bucket for this plant it can't work

94
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:46,120
that way with 1,200 plants and 800 foot

95
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:49,930
beds it can't do that and so it has

96
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,598
changed from less individual love with

97
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,879
each plant which gets frustrating but

98
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:56,439
more hands-on the plant which can be

99
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,598
good and bad I just had that

100
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:01,509
conversation before I left the built

101
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:03,339
that room that a woman went up to me and

102
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:06,819
was asking me about that so that that

103
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:09,069
can change because you have good and bad

104
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:11,949
energy else that's touching that plant

105
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:14,348
and not just yours and so not everybody

106
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:16,870
checks their intentions at the way that

107
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:19,300
that the way that I would check my

108
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,000
intentions of oh I'm having a bad day I

109
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,728
probably shouldn't

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,639
Deepti we've today or something that's

111
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:29,709
like too much touching yeah because they

112
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,918
feel bad you know and so I still have

113
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:35,159
that sensitivity but now it's multiply

114
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,649
it out so that's changed

115
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,610
yeah you only have so much energy to its

116
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:43,289
twenty hours a day and four people and

117
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:46,710
so in both states you're basically

118
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:51,060
growing cultivars that for extraction

119
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:52,979
purposes yes you like what they could do

120
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,189
whether it's yield or quality or

121
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:59,450
whatever this the commercial cultivation

122
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:02,370
in California will be for the purpose of

123
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:05,849
licensed flower but also we want to

124
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:09,629
introduce a concentrate flame that has

125
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:12,210
been close to my heart for me so it will

126
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:15,959
be for in the end for both what's in the

127
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:18,329
it'll be propane James extracts and

128
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,310
there will probably be a hydrocarbon

129
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:22,889
it'll be hydrocarbon extracts but in

130
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,949
that we're not going to seek out type

131
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:29,219
seven we'll be partnering with hash

132
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:31,560
making friends that have licenses in

133
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,500
California so that we can build each

134
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,389
other up yeah what everybody played

135
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,959
those drinks because you can't be good

136
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,500
at everything

137
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,719
but I can have input on that and because

138
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,470
I know the equipment and I know the

139
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,810
process and it's me so there's my pseudo

140
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,430
vertical there was so when Jane came to

141
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,079
visit me one time in Arizona it was

142
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,410
really great because I was taking some

143
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,599
she introduced a couple people that

144
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,580
ended up being clients of mine on a

145
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,060
short-term basis and we were driving out

146
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:06,539
to go see grow and I wanted them to meet

147
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,519
the chef because I knew that Jane would

148
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,860
instantly love this company the same way

149
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:14,299
I love this company and the reason why I

150
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,100
love this company is because this

151
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,710
individual has turned himself into an

152
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,939
analytical chemist because he cared he

153
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:23,489
used to be in the restaurant business

154
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,939
and now you know he's a chef and does

155
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,290
all the products for this company and

156
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:29,699
he's an analytical chemist because he

157
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,470
couldn't figure out certain things so he

158
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,629
would call our lab when I was at a lab I

159
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,220
used to be CSO for a lab in Arizona and

160
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,110
he would call all the time we'd be like

161
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,660
oh it's almost time for Francis to call

162
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,419
you know I mean and but we love that

163
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,400
because that is how you learn you you

164
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:46,439
ask questions when you're in

165
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,769
you're fighting with somebody something

166
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,629
for example he started in Arizona

167
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:54,089
there's no requirement for testing and

168
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,889
so because it mattered to you yeah

169
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:58,138
that's just it's gonna change now

170
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:01,139
finally but it's gonna be six months of

171
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:04,889
rules making so but yet all of this time

172
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,750
the best society and I love in Arizona

173
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,728
to support those companies that test

174
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,500
because they care right and so this was

175
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:12,870
and the and the consumers that care

176
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,459
that's what captured in my heart about

177
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,530
there is that people are coming in off

178
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,089
the street and testing their product

179
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,948
that they bought and in the state of

180
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:22,189
Colorado you can't do that you're not

181
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:25,590
allowed that's right that's ridiculous

182
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:27,240
yeah right so in Colorado you're not if

183
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,728
you buy something in the dispenser you

184
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,829
can double-check it yourself you cannot

185
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:33,538
and here's what's crazy to me you can

186
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:36,569
get your Molly that you buy at a

187
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:39,330
freaking feste and have that tested by

188
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:43,080
companies right there on site but you

189
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,610
can't test your cash as a consumer

190
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,278
that's bananas

191
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:50,850
that's CSS Arizona blew my mind for

192
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,559
Howard how open we yeah we had to and

193
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,389
and so we're amazing

194
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,429
yes so we're meeting with this company

195
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:58,919
and he would get stuck on something in

196
00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:00,659
so he just would start on his own he's

197
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,490
say so what is your recommendation our

198
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:03,629
chemist would say tests the top of the

199
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,850
batch the middle of the batch and the

200
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:08,399
bottom of the batch and then you know

201
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:11,159
you're honing in on a you know an

202
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,899
appropriate and working SOP and he does

203
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,519
it all the time

204
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:16,559
still for every batch and so we get

205
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,939
there we're visiting the clients of

206
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,979
myself were talking about grow

207
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,140
operations and so Jaynes talking with

208
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,450
him about extraction and then they were

209
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,159
having some problems and she's like oh I

210
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,620
know that machine let's go take a look

211
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,240
at it you actually solved a massive

212
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,519
problem for them on site because you

213
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,500
know how the equipment works right I

214
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,028
mean it was just I sold that equipment I

215
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,009
still saw that equipped so they're like

216
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:39,570
oh this is all we need you're like yeah

217
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:42,419
just ordered this part talked to this

218
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:45,810
person and then handle it so when when

219
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:48,750
you work with people that value and it's

220
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:50,939
reciprocated it is not just taking

221
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,059
advantage of oh I know you it

222
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:58,050
we know that there we each bring value

223
00:09:54,059 --> 00:10:00,629
to each other and I would rather work

224
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:04,169
with people that I can trust and then

225
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:06,179
there's a mutual respect and then I know

226
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:07,828
your product I know your work ethic and

227
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:09,149
I want to continue working with people

228
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:10,799
like that I want to continue working

229
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:13,909
with people like you and the industry

230
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:19,698
and that's give a shit

231
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:19,698
Eamon we're a lovefest

232
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:26,909
the peanut gallery

233
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:28,588
what's an extraction innovation like

234
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:31,679
either technologically or new

235
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:34,259
methodologies that you're kind of is

236
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,489
either imminently coming or it just came

237
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,100
and it's exciting you

238
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,539
I'm thinking of Murphy right now color

239
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,070
remediation

240
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:47,769
well chromatography so Jets and it's and

241
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,960
it's and it's pretty it's it's simple if

242
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:52,299
you do it the right way and it can be in

243
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,310
line with your attraction so people that

244
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:56,409
are because it does aid in pesticide

245
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:59,019
remediation so that's a big thing that's

246
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:01,149
hot right now of like you know how when

247
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:03,549
consistencies of hashed change and

248
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,679
Shatter was all that mattered and then

249
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:07,899
you know if it if it doesn't shatter it

250
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:11,019
doesn't matter and then it moves over to

251
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:13,480
sauce and sugar and diamonds and all of

252
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:16,600
the and right now you know diamonds are

253
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:22,120
still big in the market and I would say

254
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,920
CRC Tech is as far as something that

255
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,190
people are really getting into right now

256
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:30,579
and it's just media filtration and you

257
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,470
can do it a few different ways and and

258
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,540
people already do that with distillate

259
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,160
and everything and it's just a same

260
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:43,240
concept of being able to make your

261
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:45,909
extracts a nicer color and to be able to

262
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,740
clarify some of if there are pesticides

263
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:49,569
certain things like that that would pull

264
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:55,509
or attach to so

265
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:58,600
or clay and being able to make your hash

266
00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:00,279
better have you seen any in your talk

267
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,519
you talked about the right time for

268
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:07,990
harvesting for based off of your

269
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:11,199
trichome coloration so clear milky amber

270
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:14,049
and I am was wondering are there any

271
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,070
technologies that actually can from an

272
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:20,139
image do a based off of pixelation and

273
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,750
the colors of pixels are there apps out

274
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,819
there that can actually measure that so

275
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:30,809
you can say take a picture of let's say

276
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:33,790
go out take it be a computer vision like

277
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:36,609
recognition and then it will say okay

278
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:39,610
there's a certain ratio of red and then

279
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:44,039
it can do a gradation of you know from

280
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,039
how milky and you could kind of set it

281
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,290
well just shit just and yeah so it'll

282
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:54,370
just give you an X percent clear X

283
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:58,240
percent Amber experts and milk what

284
00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:00,700
percentages and stuff like a seven CBG

285
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,810
if you want if you're trying to do

286
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:07,090
something for extract that maybe you

287
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:08,529
want to have more of a docile effect to

288
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,970
it or yeah I mean just to be able to

289
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:12,309
take an image let's say just from a

290
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,500
single Cola right and you just have you

291
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:17,529
take a picture so it's then going to

292
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,990
actually identify and if you can do a

293
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:23,019
micro image so then you microwatt no

294
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:30,310
skin but like it's a colas it's a Cola

295
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:37,090
skin that's trademarked colas can but

296
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:40,259
yeah so if you do a micro Cola Cola skin

297
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,940
and so then it'll say okay you know the

298
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:45,009
amount of Reds the Mount of Browns the

299
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,290
amount of yellows right because you're

300
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:47,919
gonna amount of white also harvest coal

301
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:53,649
isn't

302
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:55,778
that's from a commercial scale that

303
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:57,970
would be huge but you could actually

304
00:13:55,778 --> 00:14:00,009
from a craft perspective you know from a

305
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,040
smaller and then you're like really

306
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:06,429
picking and then say if I really want to

307
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:09,639
do specifically for extraction and I

308
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:12,638
want that creamy color then I want to

309
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:15,549
stop once I start to see this percentage

310
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,019
of Reds start to appear and then you

311
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:19,419
could just do that with an image I was

312
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,549
just curious if you were coming home so

313
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:23,919
that's something we're gonna talk about

314
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:25,479
that next year microscope right we'll

315
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,269
talk about that next year that's what

316
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,639
you're talking beyond next the colas

317
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:33,509
cancer hope Jones rule over that gosh

318
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,509
I'm so proud

319
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,559
remember when you started talking about

320
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,740
Driscoll's

321
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:44,259
yeah and my talk and you talk about that

322
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:48,549
and then like the relevance to cannabis

323
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:50,500
culture propagation tissue culture so

324
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:53,229
something I didn't talk about in my

325
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,990
presentation and I'll just introduce

326
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:59,980
here's I am starting a new company a

327
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:02,350
Davina and what a Davina is doing is we

328
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,230
are going to be selling clones and I'm

329
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,820
in Arizona and worked really hard to get

330
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,970
him passed which finally passed

331
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:14,769
anyways so but we're going to be selling

332
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:18,810
young young plants and and also unrooted

333
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:21,459
cuttings and all of those mother's stock

334
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:23,469
will be coming from tissue culture and

335
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:25,778
it is very similar to a Driscoll's model

336
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,940
where most are all strawberries are

337
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:33,159
highly susceptible to disease and

338
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,779
viruses and so every six months or every

339
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:39,278
year they'll go back to their germ plasm

340
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:42,610
their their their cryo gene bank and

341
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,559
then they will start new plants and then

342
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,690
they will grow up and then they can take

343
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,500
cuts and they treat each of those plants

344
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,329
as moms in the same way we do and then

345
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,269
that's a really good efficient

346
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:58,309
commercial model but the and the reason

347
00:15:55,269 --> 00:16:00,139
why that matters for driscoll's in a

348
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:03,289
absolutely should matter for us is that

349
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:05,750
they're clean they're clean of diseases

350
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:09,889
they're clean of pathogens they're clean

351
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:13,789
of viruses and so by starting with fresh

352
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:16,039
mother's stock all the time and pushing

353
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:18,049
the grow and the right way we can

354
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:21,860
actually harvest a large number of

355
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:25,639
clones per plant in a very small

356
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,820
footprint and then to sell them actually

357
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,069
as unrooted cuts is an advantage for a

358
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,650
lot of people because with him we can no

359
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,270
longer be bound by the state boundary

360
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:37,970
lines we can ship everywhere and then

361
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:42,620
you can stick and a lot of routes and

362
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:45,980
your climate and your environment what

363
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:49,789
horrifies me is when i here in arizona

364
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:51,529
they just started him production they

365
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,969
everybody was getting their licenses in

366
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,399
June and July and they immediately

367
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,320
rushed out to plant and it was

368
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:02,329
horrifying if they were working with

369
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,920
clones they were wrong they were way

370
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,439
past their peak they should have been

371
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,599
you know topped and and allowed to wait

372
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,600
but everyone's so excited to get in the

373
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:15,948
ground but then nothing lives what's the

374
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:18,649
point and so and then it will also be

375
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:21,019
advised it's not just a transaction it's

376
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:26,209
I give a shit and my 18 we give a shit

377
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:28,879
so then it will be assisted by us along

378
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,680
the journey to ensure success what's the

379
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,010
point of selling a bunch of clones if I

380
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,640
will never ever ever have you back

381
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:37,910
what's the point

382
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,820
and so by assisting in that process and

383
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:43,930
then if it's just a stupid idea if you

384
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:47,000
want to plant in Phoenix Arizona

385
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:49,640
outdoors in July I'm just not going to

386
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,430
sell to you right I mean there's just no

387
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,740
reason yeah I can't let you have like

388
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:57,410
offseason you have like an offseason you

389
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,210
know like you know we're closed for

390
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,700
winter months or whatever you're closed

391
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,390
for summer months to the public it is

392
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,220
doing your smart

393
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,340
and people call today's outdoors in

394
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,380
Arizona yes and tell me about like the

395
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:13,079
different like here you know it's like

396
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:19,080
emeralds right you know tumbled down

397
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:20,639
here to pink like what what's the where

398
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:22,849
the look is like you wouldn't do it in

399
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,110
Phoenix like where it's desert humid so

400
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:26,219
absolutely you can you just have to do

401
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:28,979
it right and it's not going to be a

402
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,829
year-round for outdoor unless you have

403
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,960
some sort of technology like so I'll use

404
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:36,990
what I did previously as an example when

405
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,269
I started growing in Arizona it this

406
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:42,210
particular company had an indoor grow in

407
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:45,200
the Phoenix area and then kind of about

408
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:48,660
two hours away from Phoenix

409
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,450
there was a greenhouse and then when we

410
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,370
were hired they said we want to start

411
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,769
growing outdoors and we're like awesome

412
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:57,689
that's a great idea the Sun is free this

413
00:18:55,769 --> 00:19:00,298
is a beautiful growing environment

414
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,460
year-round if it's done right and it

415
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:04,230
depends on the crops there it just

416
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,259
depends and they said well we want to

417
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:10,589
start growing outside in July and all of

418
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,700
our clones have already been taken and

419
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:16,019
they're a transplant and they're ready

420
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,450
to go from the greenhouse outdoors and

421
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:22,319
we're like yeah I would not recommend

422
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:25,380
doing that what we did instead was we

423
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:28,109
invested in a retractable roof structure

424
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,540
it's manufactured by crave oh but that

425
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:32,159
has the sides that are screened if

426
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,418
you've been into any plant nursery a lot

427
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,740
of times they'll use those for the

428
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,840
bedding plants area where you shop

429
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,058
around but it also has a retractable

430
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,490
roof and what's great about that

431
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:43,129
technology is you can actually go ahead

432
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:47,009
and screen your plants you have

433
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:49,530
beautiful percentages of shade screening

434
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:51,058
and so you can actually close that up

435
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:52,769
during the hottest time of the day but

436
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:55,399
you can also close it up during the

437
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:58,048
winter months to trap the heat in and

438
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,290
after that instead of letting it out

439
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:03,450
because we're a desert but we also get

440
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:05,039
we're a high desert we get below

441
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,080
freezing on a regular basis so you

442
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,048
couldn't grow year-round in Arizona

443
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:12,089
necessarily unless you were able to trap

444
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:14,730
the heat in some way and I will say

445
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:15,649
there was a haboob that that came

446
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,180
through

447
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,550
you know what a haboob is those dust

448
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,680
storms that you see somebody comes

449
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:23,808
running out and I'm working out in the

450
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,830
grow and someone's like haboob haboob

451
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:29,629
and also awfully haboob holy shit and we

452
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:31,699
were working on the roof of the

453
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,250
structure the craven structure the motor

454
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,049
was down for whatever reason what's not

455
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,000
the company's fault it was my dumbass

456
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:39,139
company's fault for not paying to have

457
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,130
it install properly

458
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:47,840
anyways so yes I had there are two guys

459
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,360
they threw up the tallest ladder as you

460
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:54,199
could see and they're pulling 70,000

461
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:55,699
square foot of roofing as fast as they

462
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,380
could and I'm recording this whole thing

463
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,500
and I was like ah fuck it looks like

464
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:03,140
hell here it comes it's that wall of

465
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,210
like dark brown orange cuz it's just

466
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,330
coming for us right and I was like fuck

467
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:11,240
and then over here it's blue death and

468
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:13,609
destruction gorgeous holy shit we gotta

469
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,210
close just in time and it was like a

470
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:18,529
windy day inside our entire crop would

471
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,029
have been destroyed we would have lost

472
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,029
everything and this wasn't him

473
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:32,189
don't love her yeah it's also one of the

474
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,190
important things that I services that

475
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,259
I'll be offering I've spent the last

476
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,028
couple of years working on SOPs so

477
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:40,589
you're not gonna find me on Instagram

478
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:43,558
and Facebook I just don't do that

479
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:46,259
because yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean it

480
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:49,019
ends you know what I just want to make

481
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:51,538
sure that when we get going it's as

482
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:53,579
optimized as I can get it at least for

483
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:56,339
right now based off of the technology in

484
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:57,990
hand but it's the fires if you're in the

485
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,480
California areas to be able to preserve

486
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,638
your genetics with cryopreservation

487
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,700
whether it's seed banking tissue banking

488
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:08,369
if you're in Florida or Texas with the

489
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,889
you know natural disasters that are

490
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:13,469
happening to be able in that nursery

491
00:22:10,888 --> 00:22:16,979
everything we had was basically toxins

492
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:20,339
raining all over them from houses and

493
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,259
commercial buildings burning down stuff

494
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,869
when we don't have insurance you know

495
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,940
within companies now hopefully like the

496
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:29,099
insurance will be real who knows like

497
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,870
we're still figuring that out for crop

498
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:33,480
insurance but there's nothing to protect

499
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:36,479
anybody in the event of these losses and

500
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,289
you lose everything in yeah we we had

501
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,710
multiple insurance policies but it's a

502
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:44,659
and proving that you did things their

503
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,809
way that that would have you know they

504
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:51,220
have like a crop loss for pests or

505
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:54,259
something they have to prove that you

506
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:57,350
fed your plants a certain way and did

507
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:59,599
all of their outline of things would be

508
00:22:57,349 --> 00:23:03,289
able to show it we need redundancy and

509
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:07,129
and and certain securities and I think

510
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:09,470
that will also go towards being able to

511
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,970
pull something out if there's a you

512
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,289
mentioned you know nobody's doing blue

513
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,269
dream right now but maybe they will

514
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:15,799
later right well let's get going back

515
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:18,710
it's coming back everything's gonna come

516
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,389
back who knows so if we're not

517
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,430
interested let's not lose it let's

518
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,140
preserve it and then we can pull it out

519
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,970
when we're ready and then we've

520
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,280
preserved it when it was already

521
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,400
certified clean of what we could at

522
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:35,000
least test from a panel of pathogens and

523
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,670
viruses at the time we can pull it out

524
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,119
and be like it's the flavor of the month

525
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:43,130
disco came back again everything comes

526
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,379
back I'm old enough to see that should

527
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:56,060
happen I've seen all the fashions even

528
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:57,320
going this time shoulder pads entire I

529
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,509
thought my boobs are too big it just

530
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:07,179
doesn't work you know you just don't

531
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:07,180
need to emphasize works for her

532
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,288
we're actually like the questions that

533
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,599
were being asked at the end can you talk

534
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:17,398
about some of the cut like without any

535
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,798
interesting questions they were

536
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:22,548
interesting questions oh one of the

537
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:26,418
questions that was really interesting

538
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:30,028
how long will it take to rescue a

539
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:32,278
particular strain do I really think it

540
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:35,308
will take you know upwards of a year to

541
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:39,148
do a true rescue think of it it has an

542
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:42,269
identified disease yeah and so I thought

543
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:46,439
that was a really good question and it

544
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:49,379
also allowed me to share there's a lot

545
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,960
of Rd still to do you know nobody no lab

546
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,960
no consultant right now is going to have

547
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,240
all of the answers we're going to have

548
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,649
what are the best practices and other

549
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,450
industries that we should absolutely

550
00:24:58,648 --> 00:25:02,250
start with we don't we're not

551
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:04,140
reinventing the wheel gonna ask do you

552
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,140
study other plants - are you like

553
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,538
cannabis is my jam

554
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:11,940
certainly cannabis is my thing but from

555
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:12,960
a I used to study a lot of other plants

556
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,028
so I actually used to work with

557
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,360
strawberries and orchids and then I'm

558
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:22,409
also very interested in other medicinal

559
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:25,469
crops of value not just for the cannabis

560
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:28,559
industry but I'm certainly interested in

561
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:32,819
pursuing mushroom actually cultivation

562
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:36,389
kava you know some of the other products

563
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:38,038
that so yeah basically if there's no

564
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,750
protocol and there might be some sort of

565
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,278
value I'm interested in it because I'm

566
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,019
interested in like cheating my cell

567
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,950
phone for two years to figure out how to

568
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:49,490
do it and then maybe you know somehow

569
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:52,919
offer that information that's what I got

570
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:59,370
smart is barter and science together

571
00:25:52,919 --> 00:26:01,740
like smarter - that a - I want to know

572
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:03,509
but yeah they asked why you know and

573
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,048
they really also wanted to know why do I

574
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:09,599
think it's going to take so long and so

575
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:11,929
what a year to clean something up let's

576
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:11,928
say

577
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:20,400
what is your favorite strain right now

578
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:23,430
what's yours right now oh boy let's see

579
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,880
well always Rosetta right let's just say

580
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:28,340
but let's use Rosetta then right it's

581
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,080
your mom

582
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:33,659
something's punky something's going on

583
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:36,449
I'm gonna come out and then I'm gonna

584
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:40,019
take some cuts or maybe you bring your

585
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:42,000
mom to me and then I immediately start

586
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,819
doing crop maintenance I'm flushing it

587
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,880
out I'm collecting the drainage taking

588
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:49,859
it into the lab anything that I have

589
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,430
defoliated I collect and I immediately

590
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:56,369
take the lamb I put that Rosetta plant

591
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,750
in quarantine right everything should be

592
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:59,819
quarantined when you bring anything new

593
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:02,849
into your facility quarantine everything

594
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:04,109
quarantine everything yeah yeah I even

595
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:07,439
see popping yeah

596
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:09,329
so it goes into quarantine until I get a

597
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,130
clean test report if I can't get a clean

598
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:12,089
test report and I at least understand

599
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,320
what I'm dealing with

600
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:17,429
then I will take clean cuts propagates

601
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:19,379
actually and put it into a separate

602
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,330
quarantine and I get rid of that

603
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,060
original mother right away because I

604
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:26,429
don't want the substrate mess whether it

605
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,799
be soil and all of the bugs that that

606
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:30,870
brings in and I just want to start

607
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,389
actually taking the fresh new cuts

608
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:35,759
because for me and tissue culture I want

609
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,590
as many nodes as I can get but a lot of

610
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,569
times with good propagation techniques

611
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:43,230
we can outgrow a lot of things that

612
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:45,240
might be you know just like a little bit

613
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:48,150
bad and as long as we are treating it

614
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,759
with preventative biologicals whether it

615
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,230
be biological pesticides or nematodes or

616
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:54,029
whatever the problem may be but we don't

617
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:57,029
know what to do until we have a diagnose

618
00:27:54,029 --> 00:28:00,240
you know a test diagnostic to say this

619
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:02,160
is what you're dealing with so start

620
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,680
with a whole new set of cuts and then I

621
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,150
immediately get it into culture and if I

622
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,980
again don't know what I'm dealing with

623
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:10,200
and I just end up with contaminated

624
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,610
culturing so then I want to I can't do

625
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,340
nodal culturing I'm gonna do

626
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:16,349
meristematic culturing meristematic

627
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:18,599
culturing takes a little bit of time

628
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:22,219
underneath the scope and then you are

629
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:24,799
just taking a very very small

630
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:28,279
very small cut and you're placing it on

631
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:31,220
media that's going to take a period of

632
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:33,529
time let's say everything just to route

633
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,890
use a round number everything let's say

634
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:40,039
takes four weeks just as a general rule

635
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:42,460
of one month so just one month to get

636
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:46,399
that meristem to all of a sudden be like

637
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:48,200
I'm living and now I something that

638
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,450
looks like it could be a shoot and it's

639
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:55,490
very small then I'm gonna transfer that

640
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:57,380
into another media recipe and put it on

641
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,299
the shelf for another month and now I'm

642
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,850
starting to get growth and development

643
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:03,649
if I don't get contamination but I have

644
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:06,649
to grow that enough and get enough

645
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:08,540
product that I can sacrifice so let's

646
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,280
say I have a hundred vessels of this now

647
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:13,430
and it's taken me a couple months to get

648
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:16,160
to this it's probably several months to

649
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:18,890
do that because it's cereal every time

650
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,870
it yeah so four weeks to get to

651
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:24,320
multiplication and then let's say it

652
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:27,619
started at one and now I have two that I

653
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:30,230
can dissect to two shoots that I dissect

654
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:32,750
that let those go another four weeks and

655
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,970
now each one of those have two and I

656
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,690
dissect those out so that's four weeks

657
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:40,880
four weeks so that's now three months

658
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:42,740
but we're growing the number of material

659
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,450
the amount of material that we have and

660
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,130
so before I actually have enough

661
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,980
material to send out to the laboratory

662
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:53,090
for analysis we're looking at about six

663
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:55,279
months if the meristem was viable when I

664
00:29:53,089 --> 00:30:00,679
actually harvested if things work along

665
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:02,839
the way and so I think we as labs should

666
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,000
not over promise we should not say I

667
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:07,759
absolutely can rescue everything is

668
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,150
salvageable that's not true all the time

669
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:13,700
and again it depends on if I can work

670
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,470
with you as a grower is this your only

671
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:19,069
plan that can I keep coming out to take

672
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:21,559
fresh new cuts can i if I'm failing in

673
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:24,089
the laboratory can I come out and start

674
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,769
again because again

675
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:28,179
relationships yeah and we need that time

676
00:30:26,769 --> 00:30:30,730
in the laboratories to actually work

677
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,620
those methods out if I'm good underneath

678
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:34,779
the microscope it's gonna take a while

679
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:36,699
to train my staff to get good at a

680
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:39,700
microscope and be able to translate that

681
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,319
knowledge and so everybody is new and

682
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,840
everybody's building and I just think

683
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,039
that US labs need to be transparent

684
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,339
about where we're at and what our

685
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:50,200
challenges are and driscoll's I remember

686
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:53,529
asking one time what is your viability

687
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,990
percentage for meristem and they said

688
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:57,700
50% and they smiled they're like and I

689
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,130
was like fifty percent fully shit and

690
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:03,100
they're like you just need one you just

691
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:05,410
need one to take and be successful and

692
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:06,939
it's like well I understand and it

693
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,560
helped me put in perspective because I

694
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,630
felt like I was failing all the time if

695
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,819
I wasn't at 100% viability in my

696
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:15,310
meristematic culturing because it's hard

697
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:18,629
you have to pull every single little

698
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:21,190
primordial leaf off and then just get to

699
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:25,240
that little embarrassed of those little

700
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:27,160
cells and then somehow pop that out and

701
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,529
not lose it in the microscope right and

702
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,930
then plate that and that takes practice

703
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:34,509
and time and then even with with the

704
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:36,370
best of them it doesn't work all the

705
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:39,220
time and so it takes time and it's

706
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:42,789
expensive not what we're doing in the

707
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:45,460
lab as much as it is working with the

708
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:50,039
third-party laboratories to do the virus

709
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,039
and pathogen indexing it's expensive

710
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,170
part of our conversation and salia by

711
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,539
Tony

712
00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:00,450
remember but you're basically adding a

713
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:02,309
nursery operation to what you're

714
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,920
currently doing tissue culture but the

715
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:07,289
logical next step is to have clones

716
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,720
ready to go so that's the company you're

717
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:13,259
launching yeah okay and then will that

718
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,140
be a balance between kind of the host

719
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:19,049
cultivars that you guys are doing mad

720
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,300
science on and breeding and then say the

721
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:22,649
clients we can also score your genetics

722
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:25,649
that you

723
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:28,320
and get them flown ready and climate

724
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:32,730
acclimated for you yeah all of all of

725
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:36,000
that and one of my partners actually is

726
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:38,460
a as an attorney in Arizona and his

727
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,299
specialty is intellectual property and

728
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:45,029
so if you were a breeder and you want it

729
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:48,450
and we do want to sell your genetics and

730
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:50,009
so our attorney part of the service is

731
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,200
to work with you maybe you just want

732
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:54,809
trademark maybe you want licensing or

733
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,809
maybe you just want to sell us your your

734
00:32:54,809 --> 00:33:00,029
your stream but all of that should be

735
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,529
upfront and delivered to you as the

736
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:04,019
breeder to have the option of what you

737
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:06,480
want to do and even if it's a royalty

738
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:08,970
for example something that I think we

739
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,339
haven't heard enough in our industry is

740
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:15,059
how do we reward the breeders and how do

741
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:17,759
we pay yeah and so in the horticulture

742
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:19,950
industry when you breed something if

743
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:22,680
it's the hot new petunia and it's got

744
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:25,319
this orange that is a new hot shit in

745
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:29,789
the market for the spring that is a

746
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:32,129
licensed strain and then every plant

747
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:34,980
sold a royalty goes back to the breeder

748
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:36,150
or to the company that bred it these

749
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,130
breeders have been working for a long

750
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:44,870
time on their genetics and I I fuckin

751
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:47,610
want to pay them for that and I think

752
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:49,799
there's nothing wrong with having a

753
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:52,409
business model to do that as long as

754
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:54,389
we're transparent and we say we do have

755
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,279
these services if you just want and need

756
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,630
some tissue culture or preserve your

757
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:00,089
stock then that's all that's gonna

758
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:03,210
happen with it right if you want to work

759
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:04,919
and actually sell your strain and it up

760
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:07,740
and it's a strain that we can offer in

761
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,690
our library and then we can help you and

762
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,280
work with you on that on that licensing

763
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:13,050
or trademarking and make sure that

764
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,169
either how do you want to be paid do you

765
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,539
want to just be paid you know a lump sum

766
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:19,849
or are you good with a royalty and then

767
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:23,840
if it's 10 million

768
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:25,339
unit so comments like where I want to

769
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:29,990
give it away but I don't want someone

770
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:32,240
else to drive it that's right so it's so

771
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:34,609
important to me and and and the people

772
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,509
that I'm working with and so to make

773
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:42,860
sure that anybody can make money doing

774
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:45,910
what there have been building and and

775
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:49,789
working towards their whole careers just

776
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:51,440
be transparent and then let's all have a

777
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:56,860
good business and enjoy what we're doing

778
00:34:51,440 --> 00:35:00,110
right and so it's been a long road and

779
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:02,720
when I say long road you get this

780
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,610
there's been a lot of characters that

781
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,859
have come across and said hey do you

782
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:08,510
want ten million dollars do you want

783
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,860
this and you want that or hey why don't

784
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,350
you come work for me and I'm gonna

785
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,970
promise you the world no I'm not I have

786
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:17,360
not because it's not been the right

787
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:20,000
alignment it's not been the right not

788
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,920
everybody on the team gave a shit yeah

789
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,329
you know and so everybody on the team

790
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,809
needs to give a shit we're here because

791
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:28,039
we enjoy what we do we're not here to

792
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:31,099
rate the industry of all their knowledge

793
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:34,009
and and so I think yeah intentions

794
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:38,329
that's my that's my discerning factor as

795
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:41,660
I age not as gracefully as hope but as I

796
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:45,079
age into my future I do it loud and

797
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:47,179
messy okay but I'm like oh that just

798
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:49,039
sermon of does that person is that

799
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:51,409
person helping me be the best version of

800
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,480
myself and that includes my work because

801
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:56,509
my work is

802
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,909
yeah it is what we do what what are some

803
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,830
of the so imposed a walk here in

804
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:04,250
California to so California Colorado

805
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:06,769
Arizona give a shout out to some either

806
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:10,429
breeders or cultivators that you guys

807
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:11,840
like I love coming to the show and as

808
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:13,519
soon as I come into this show there are

809
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,680
two people that I immediately contact

810
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:18,619
Jane I'm coming to the show you can be

811
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:24,109
the show you contacted me i Adam Adam

812
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:26,900
Shox yep out of Oregon and he does a lot

813
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:28,640
for the children and the whole universe

814

bring it he understands how to get to a

816
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,619
stable P one he understands the number

817
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:38,899
and the time it takes he's a breeder and

818
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:41,389
he understands you're not going to just

819
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:45,130
do one cross and say there you go and

820
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:45,129
sell a bunch of unstable seed lines

821
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:55,340
a good breeder oh you had a very other

822
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,360
slide about it so in my mind a breeder

823
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:02,809
knows that you need to start with two

824
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:10,910
parents that have been back cross and

825
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:14,210
are a stable p1 meaning all of the you

826
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:16,759
self to itself until you get rid of and

827
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:19,250
you try to get to either all big a big a

828
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,870
or all Lille's Lille's right if you

829
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:23,329
think of your punnett square when you

830
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:25,489
have a one parent you get a set of

831
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:26,509
chromosomes from each and so you could

832
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:30,679
when you do that you have the

833
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:33,920
probability of getting big a big a big a

834
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:35,659
little a big a little a and Lily Lily

835
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,450
what you want to do is you want a back

836
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:42,649
cross until you really have a very pure

837
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:44,839
line for both your p1 and your p2 and

838
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:47,180
then you cross and then you have to do

839
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:51,710
back crosses again before you have a

840
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:55,449
stable ff1 hybrid if a breeder actually

841
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,449
talks like that you've got my attention

842
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:02,239
and that's just to breed but what

843
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,920
happens after the breeding also and that

844
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,889
you covered that in your talk today yeah

845
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,010
just the female but I have data is a big

846
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:12,799
one for me and I know that is for you

847
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:17,030
also just your reputation I think that

848
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,220
who you are as a person goes into your

849
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,920
work the same as it does for all of us

850
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:25,309
and the outcome that that person

851
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,829
produces coupled with data because a

852
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:29,630
person that is passionate about what

853
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:32,739
they're doing they want to do a really

854
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:35,450
good job right so don't put in the work

855
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:37,250
so when you were when you were sourcing

856
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:39,859
the genetics for your

857
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:42,079
Colorado rose to resourcing in front so

858
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,910
that's it that's what I was going to say

859
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,989
who some of my favorite breeders were

860
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:52,940
Dominion seed company and nerds genetics

861
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:55,369
are a bulk of our garden Dominion seed

862
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:58,280
companies what I love is that he has

863
00:38:55,369 --> 00:39:00,440
some really fun mom's like I hope it

864
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:05,480
doesn't care if I say but like some

865
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:07,490
stupid guy yes we're sure yeah that's

866
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,340
actually that's my love Nathan and

867
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:13,219
that's that's my partner in the project

868
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:16,820
on his property in Trinity in California

869
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:20,959
but we love Duke and we love Dominion

870
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:22,910
seed company he's he's he's he's done a

871
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,059
lot of the work and he's a perfectionist

872
00:39:22,909 --> 00:39:27,559
which most most breeders I know are that

873
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:30,769
they won't put their name on something

874
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:35,690
but they haven't really put so much work

875
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:39,500
into but he has really cool fun genetics

876
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:44,860
like a hash plant from Lebanon from 1977

877
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:47,900
you know like really crazy medicine

878
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:51,530
medicine that has fun stories behind it

879
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:55,490
but that also just produces these really

880
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:59,180
intense unique profiles like a you know

881
00:39:55,489 --> 00:40:01,969
an original skunk the original skunk you

882
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:06,139
know things like that and so he adds a

883
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:09,079
lot of loud to the garden same with

884
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:11,509
nerds genetics they are all very

885
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:13,909
brilliant people the guy that I'm really

886
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:16,010
close friends with Robbie went to

887
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:17,839
Colorado College by me which is a really

888
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:20,720
well-known college for it you can't be

889
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:24,230
stupid and go to that college they won't

890
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:27,169
let you it and I see stupid coming and

891
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:29,150
the name like nerds genetics because

892
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:34,309
they do so much research behind their

893
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:35,099
stuff I had processed some product for

894
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:39,958
him

895
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:43,859
in Colorado and what was amazing was he

896
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:46,409
gave me back every little number on my

897
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:48,659
job and he said well just so you know

898
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:50,728
you beat this extractor this extractor

899
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:53,518
this extractor in this extractor by this

900
00:40:50,728 --> 00:40:55,798
percentage in your return and you did

901
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:57,478
this this and this and this profile was

902
00:40:55,798 --> 00:40:59,489
high and I was like wait you were giving

903
00:40:57,478 --> 00:41:02,368
that stuff to other people too and he

904
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:03,869
was like oh yeah you know and we're

905
00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:06,838
talking about it and he was like wow you

906
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:09,150
just gave me almost double the return on

907
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:11,009
this and and then I'm like oh shit I

908
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,759
probably describe those extractors in

909
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:13,969
trouble

910
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:18,329
but being able to see somebody that

911
00:41:13,969 --> 00:41:20,548
they're they're breeding for the purpose

912
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:22,979
of producing concentrates and their

913
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:26,278
seeds are for the purpose of producing

914
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:32,429
concentrates they're like breeders for

915
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:34,739
hash certain types of chirp chirping

916
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:38,208
profiles that will come out come in we

917
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:38,208
were talking about limonene or whatever

918
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:47,190
it is for flowering but how it comes

919
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,019
through and concentrates you know there

920
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:52,289
are certain things right now I would

921
00:41:49,018 --> 00:41:55,649
love like an herbal herb line I want

922
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:59,039
that old sage that Adam Dunn had I want

923
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:00,959
those kind of fun lavender you know and

924
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:04,859
there's a beautiful opportunity for

925
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:07,498
these breeders to to target there's such

926
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:09,328
a huge need whether it be for full

927
00:42:07,498 --> 00:42:11,488
terpene profiles whether it be for

928
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:13,589
architecture and hemp for mechanical

929
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:15,449
harvesting right you want a certain

930
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:22,139
plant architecture that goes in the

931
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:25,588
ground that can be harvested there's a

932
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:28,228
lot of opportunity to actually are we

933
00:42:25,588 --> 00:42:31,018
wanting particular strains that are

934
00:42:28,228 --> 00:42:33,838
focused purely for processing do we want

935
00:42:31,018 --> 00:42:35,548
strains more focused on flower and

936
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,458
different profiles from that regard like

937
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:41,579
there are huge opportunities as breeders

938
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:43,609
to target those markets everybody's in a

939
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:46,130
goddamn rush and it's now

940
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:48,500
I mean a really a good turnaround tree

941
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:51,260
turnaround time for breeding new strains

942
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,610
that are stable true to type we're

943
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,270
looking at three to eight years

944
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:58,760
depending and that takes time and so I

945
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:59,989
think there's been a lot of good

946
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,880
breeders out there that have gotten

947
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:04,279
started and are going and I can't wait

948
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,880
to see some of their new strains coming

949
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,190
out here in the next few years that's

950
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,559
what I love yeah cuz that now people

951
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:17,300
like Adam it could be any many

952
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:20,299
cannabinoid except for and so now people

953
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:23,180
are making head again you know they're

954
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:25,250
like oh well look this this fits

955
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:27,829
everybody on the street right because

956
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:30,500
there's CBD so it's not so scary and

957
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:34,460
then we've got this extensive flavor

958
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:38,179
profile just the same as cannabis but

959
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:41,570
that fits into holistic health care and

960
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:45,349
even though I've totally believed THC is

961
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:48,650
holistic health care also it just I tell

962
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:51,619
my style it ends a lifestyle and and I I

963
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:54,139
see now how I love that they've taken

964
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:58,339
that and just on to hey let's do this to

965
00:43:54,139 --> 00:44:00,829
be able to expand the places that this

966
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,570
medicine can go in a safe space that

967
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:05,509
everybody can understand and then we'll

968
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:06,880
move on to that reintroducing that THC

969
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,170
heavy

970
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,110
and I'm really excited to work with

971
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:15,019
breeders in the lab that so there's a

972
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:17,660
way to actually breed and vitro for

973
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:20,119
example with we can use pollen but also

974
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:22,819
protoplast fusions where you actually

975
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:25,009
digest the cell wall and you can

976
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:27,350
actually go or be it and have cells

977
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,300
plant cells that are you know haploids

978
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:33,650
basically and you can actually merge

979
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:36,140
them together and make a diploid and why

980
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:40,010
not play with that you know and again

981
00:44:36,139 --> 00:44:43,309
this is normal things that are done in

982
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:47,420
other industries that I'm excited to see

983
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:49,769
and play other crops absolutely and so

984
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:55,300
I'm excited to know those whatever

985
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:59,230
why not why not and work with I don't

986
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:01,690
come from you know his you know a long

987
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:05,079
pedigree of black market you know being

988
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:07,630
part of the original cast of characters

989
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:11,199
that have come out and and created this

990
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:13,480
industry I am I'm a noob and I hate you

991
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,909
and I want to work with those characters

992
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,800
who understand the characteristics and

993
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:19,779
and the passion and oh you don't want

994
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:24,550
that that's just this that's junk like

995
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:27,280
people who are truly knowledgeable at

996
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:29,650
such an in-depth level historically who

997
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,960
understand the plants so well those are

998
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:34,720
the people that I am excited to work

999
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:37,240
with and a lot of those people are craft

1000
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:38,230
we're talking larger stuff here but that

1001
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:41,199
also craft

1002
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,579
yeah yeah I'm able to able to yeah the

1003
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,828
scalability of on the entertaining

1004
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:47,740
quality everything and that's why I love

1005
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:52,150
having an R&amp;D lab is because the lab is

1006
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:54,189
not focused on commercial production R&amp;D

1007
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:57,809
labs shouldn't have that focus the R&amp;D

1008
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:59,769
labs and I will always have R&amp;D lab

1009
00:45:57,809 --> 00:46:01,869
whatever happens with the

1010
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:05,889
bread-and-butter of cloning but the Rd

1011
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:08,410
lab is where we get to play you know how

1012
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:11,289
like within a couple years people got

1013
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:14,019
like the CBD from three percent of to

1014
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:16,389
20-plus percent with with minor

1015
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:19,030
cannabinoids and you see any movement on

1016
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:22,420
getting like the obscure cannabinoid

1017
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:24,550
counts like from 0.01 percent one

1018
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:28,000
percent or two percent it's a matter of

1019
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:31,030
time nobody's focused on it and so it's

1020
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,920
just a matter of time and do I see any

1021
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:34,960
of that I'm no longer one breeding in

1022
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,430
that direction to explore this minor can

1023
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,829
happen they are yes

1024
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:40,690
yes they are they are no longer being a

1025
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:42,609
part of analytical laboratory I don't

1026
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:44,200
get to see just kind of the blind stuff

1027
00:46:42,608 --> 00:46:46,900
that randomly comes in and be like holy

1028
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:50,199
shit you know that is a crazy high on

1029
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:51,760
THC you know t8 cv or something along

1030
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:56,019
those lines so I don't get to see that

1031
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:58,420
anymore but I have been talking with and

1032
00:46:56,019 --> 00:47:00,579
have clients all over the US and Canada

1033
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,289
and Colombia and they all are on the

1034
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:06,250
hunt for that or have that to a certain

1035
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:11,079
extent and so now everybody's excited

1036
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:15,010
focused on trying to create strains that

1037
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:18,010
have a different profile than just THC

1038
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:20,140
s-- and we now also get to have fun with

1039
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:22,990
some of these real clinical studies and

1040
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:25,659
have an idea of more than just anecdotal

1041
00:47:22,989 --> 00:47:27,848
evidence of what they're doing I want to

1042
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:30,399
know for myself of THC V is gonna help

1043
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:31,960
with wheat like I'm your first sign up

1044
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,369
for that right you don't like where's

1045
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,318
that study I want to be a part of that

1046
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:37,269
study but I mean but it's hard to get a

1047
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:40,059
hold of those products necessary unless

1048
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:42,190
she knows somebody and it just takes

1049
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:43,820
time to get it into the marketplace and

1050
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:47,760
make it more

1051
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:49,769
available outside of the small little

1052
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,590
circles in the niches and that that's

1053
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:55,050
going to happen it's happening that on

1054
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:59,039
the extraction side you can need a ton

1055
00:47:55,050 --> 00:48:01,640
of biomass to get enough of the super

1056
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:01,639
obscure

1057
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:09,519
like a concentrator and then that puts

1058
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:13,240
you in different extraction methods

1059
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:15,159
because hydrocarbon then if if if it

1060
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:18,159
pulls a higher percentage with less work

1061
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:20,409
higher hydrocarbon is great but if you

1062
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:22,389
have thousands and thousands of pounds

1063
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:24,279
that you have to run then ethanol

1064
00:48:22,389 --> 00:48:25,868
becomes you know a better thing

1065
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,720
something I'm really interested also

1066
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:31,890
from an R&amp;D lab are certain cultivation

1067
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:35,858
practices and and and feed regimes

1068
00:48:31,889 --> 00:48:38,769
influencing the you know the the

1069
00:48:35,858 --> 00:48:41,588
chemical profile could we as growers

1070
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:45,909
actually adopt oh if I'm more interested

1071
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:48,849
in bringing out and enhancing this

1072
00:48:45,909 --> 00:48:52,149
plants potential on a secondary or what

1073
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:57,760
we think of secondary cannabinoid or you

1074
00:48:52,150 --> 00:49:00,670
know focus on how to grow towards a

1075
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,369
desired terpene profile a lot of that I

1076
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:05,769
believe we can will find that there are

1077
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:08,200
certain cultivation strategies and

1078
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:11,349
certain nutrient feed regimes that we

1079
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:14,679
can do to skirt that and accomplish that

1080
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:16,660
without breeding even and so one example

1081
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:18,250
would be with Tomatoes this is some

1082
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:21,848
earlier research I did when I was an

1083
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:23,289
undergraduate and the the PhD student I

1084
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:25,630
was working for was working on

1085
00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:30,130
increasing the sugar content of tomatoes

1086
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:33,670
by increasing the salt concentration of

1087
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:37,318
the nutrient solution and what that did

1088
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:42,730
was actually creates a more concentrated

1089
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:44,710
flavor of more concentrated sugars in

1090
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:47,500
the tomato and you can measure that by

1091
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:49,510
Brix by taking the tomato off and then

1092
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,309
crumbling it and just juicing it onto

1093
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,930
the Brix reader and that gives you a

1094
00:49:51,309 --> 00:49:55,510
Brix content and that's how we can

1095
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:57,039
measure sugars and there are ways that I

1096
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:59,470
think as cultivators that we can

1097
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:04,058
actually manipulate and drive and steer

1098
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:07,259
plants the plants chemical profile we

1099
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:07,260
just need the ability to

1100
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:11,608
people meet and then to do the Rd that

1101
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,680
says you know what this is really

1102
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:15,748
working let's tweak it just a little bit

1103
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,489
but we then also need to count on the

1104
00:50:15,748 --> 00:50:18,988
data that we get from the analytical

1105
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:21,749
laboratories so we need to do tissue

1106
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:24,719
analysis of the plans through its growth

1107
00:50:21,748 --> 00:50:27,149
and development and of the yield not

1108
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:28,409
just the flower but growth and

1109
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:31,079
development because we're going to see

1110
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:32,788
certain parameters that we can measure

1111
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:33,930
throughout the growth and development of

1112
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:36,719
the plant so we don't have to always

1113
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:39,179
wait for flower to tell us how to steer

1114
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:43,170
what to do and so there's just a real

1115
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:44,909
need for that our de would be a easy way

1116
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:46,380
to actually oh I had no idea this plant

1117
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:48,420
had this potential yeah

1118
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:51,019
what could you you clever girl you

1119
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:54,469
clever clever girl let's do that yeah

1120
00:50:51,018 --> 00:50:57,468
just matter of time of money right and

1121
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:57,469
space
