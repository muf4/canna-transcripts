1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,839
I see a paint sprayer in there I feel

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,879
erikak can you because we touched on

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:16,138
that the paint sprayer and I know Scott

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,118
down in Carpinteria before everything

5
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:20,640
happened we were researching kind of

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,778
atomizers and things like that so can

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,679
you talk about kind of what you're

8
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:29,250
seeing for people spraying and

9
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,528
greenhouses yeah I mean most people are

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,719
you know using a paint sprayer for the

11
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,429
most part the cannabis community loves

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,808
paint sprayers and maybe they weren't

13
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:38,789
good for minerals that would be

14
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,949
something Scott could you know talk

15
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,750
about but as far as a lot of these oils

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,429
and the Sulphurs and things that people

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,070
are using need a great amount of

18
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:49,859
agitation in order to be thoroughly

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,859
applied properly and not leave residue

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,058
and residues create phyto toxicity and

21
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,009
technically you're supposed to be

22
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,558
spraying early early in the morning

23
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,149
before the Sun comes up not in the

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,419
evening time to let that stuff

25
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,090
necessarily soak in and so what ends up

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,820
happening with paint sprayers is that

27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,170
they don't agitate a lot of these

28
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:11,459
products that are allowed in cannabis

29
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,140
because there's not a lot of them used

30
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,809
and a lot of them do need a great amount

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,939
of agitation and if they separate that's

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,950
what causes those residues leaves the

33
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,129
phyto and then isn't effective for

34
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,960
whatever you're trying to treat and we

35
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:29,849
run into that a lot and so I mean having

36
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,919
agricultural spray tanks of any kind

37
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:34,078
they can be small they can be large but

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,879
they have to have an agitation system on

39
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,849
the inside in order to make all this

40
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,039
stuff really work house is designed to

41
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,899
work and then Scott's research more into

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,009
droplet size I mean it kind of gets

43
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,689
crazy on it but you know that's my place

44
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:50,700
because what what my kind of expanse

45
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:53,578
like the first time I was introduced to

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,530
us paint sprayer was in 2016 which was

47
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,509
really one of my first big commercial

48
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,618
projects and at that time I was like

49
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:04,228
this is amazing you know and it seemed

50
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:05,930
to really solve a lot of problems I like

51
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:08,159
that it was really lightweight

52
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,170
personally I think those like

53
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,699
over-the-shoulder atomizers is by far

54
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,679
the worst piece of equipment that I was

55
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,328
whoever was designed at leaks

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,670
all over employees and nobody wants to

57
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:19,530
use it and if an employee or cultivator

58
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,089
doesn't enjoy using a piece of equipment

59
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,848
they're not gonna use it

60
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,069
and so we went to farm after farm after

61
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:28,530
farm seeing the same systemic issues

62
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:30,539
they had those little atomizers with the

63
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,280
jug that leaks all over employees nobody

64
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,840
likes that they can't articulate them

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,329
into the plants so they just kind of

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,920
walk through the building and just kind

67
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:41,400
of blow in the air and kind of pretend

68
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,988
to do their job and then or then you end

69
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,879
up with a paint sprayer so that the

70
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,039
benefits of a paint sprayer is it has

71
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,108
you know a lightweight hose with a

72
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,479
lightweight nozzle that's easy to

73
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:53,849
articulate it has a high air pressure so

74
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,699
it'll move the plants so that's really

75
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:58,979
nice you can you can articulate the

76
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:03,078
plant into the correct position with the

77
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:06,750
spray gun itself the real hindrance of

78
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:09,030
the paint sprayer is the context a paint

79
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,479
sprayer is designed to typically spray

80
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,068
water-based or oil-based paints so they

81
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,108
have different homogenous Asian

82
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:18,539
requirements they're also spraying a

83
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:20,760
product on to a vertical surface and so

84
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:24,239
gravity is homogenizing the product for

85
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,459
you none of those apply to a plant and

86
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,709
then the other issue is that the nozzle

87
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,098
is not designed for the type of

88
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,289
atomization that pesticides need because

89
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:36,628
again it's spraying paint it's not

90
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:39,150
trying to kill pests with pesticides and

91
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:42,328
so then the other concern is droplet

92
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,669
size so if you're a conventional farmer

93
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:47,639
you have a pest issue

94
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,409
you typically contact your AG Extension

95
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,359
Office the AG extension sends a

96
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:53,969
representative out they correctly

97
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:57,299
identify the pests they recommend a

98
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:59,669
pesticide for to you to use their comes

99
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,379
along specifications for droplet size

100
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,810
that are necessary for that particular

101
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,608
compound to kill that particular pest

102
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,509
and they give you these little cards

103
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:11,250
that have water sensitive like ink on it

104
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:13,108
or something so that you spray it and

105
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,479
it's almost like a little grid that

106
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:17,848
shows you that yeah I am hitting the

107
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,819
correct spray so what people need to

108
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:23,098
really wrap their mind around is if

109
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,870
you're trying to kill a russet mite you

110
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:27,539
know just for whatever that will just

111
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,180
say a russet mite is 100

112
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,220
microns across or something and if

113
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,939
you're if you're shooting a droplet size

114
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,130
that's five times the size of that

115
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:41,550
insect well you also have gaps that are

116
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:43,350
the same size as the droplet so you're

117
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,360
you're you have two issues you have

118
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,730
you're hitting a pest with a water

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,189
droplet that has no pesticide you're

120
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,750
hitting a plant with only pesticide and

121
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,990
then you're missing the insect

122
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,240
altogether and so we I went to farm

123
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,939
after farm after farm all through 2016

124
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,680
2017 2018 people are using pest sprayer

125
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:07,050
they can't get on top of pests and then

126
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,269
I can't remember what year it was but in

127
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,759
in the first I think really the first

128
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:13,289
regenerative conference up there in

129
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,719
Portland

130
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,550
Susan Wainwright the bug lady was there

131
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,110
and she talked about this phenomenon I

132
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,110
think that was the first time I really

133
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,930
had it explained in that way where I

134
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,610
really had an aha movement I think why

135
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,340
it hasn't settled on the cannabis

136
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,870
industries because Susan usually talks

137
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,449
to you like a scolding teacher and I

138
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,250
don't think people you know follow

139
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,259
sometimes it's a little just their tones

140
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,060
a little disrespectful but what she's

141
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,889
trying to say is helpful in that you

142
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,889
need to have a proper nozzle that

143
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:45,870
atomizes properly that has small enough

144
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:50,039
droplets so that you're actually hitting

145
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,509
the pest with a homogenized solution

146
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,110
that will actually kill the targeted

147
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:58,800
pest and so yeah paint sprayers are

148
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,629
great for spraying nutrients you you

149
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,430
know you'll never get on top of pests

150
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:04,769
and Eric was consulting on a project

151
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,060
just recently where they're spraying and

152
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:07,829
spraying and spraying and spraying and

153
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,530
spraying and you know he suggested they

154
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:13,079
use the commercial sprayers you know the

155
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:14,759
crew has an objection for one reason or

156
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,959
another for the sprayers on why they

157
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,300
don't want to use them but what's

158
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:21,539
important is that nozzle is designed to

159
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,560
homogenize and atomized pesticides for

160
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,420
the issue of dealing with pests and

161
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,610
we're in a we're in a real pickle right

162
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:33,030
now in cannabis in that there hasn't

163
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,740
been a lot of focus on our needs so you

164
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:36,869
know you have like the big DRAM sprayers

165
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,120
they have these giant plastic tanks will

166
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,470
those cause issues with microbial issues

167
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,480
sometimes

168
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,990
not in my opinion the best suited for

169
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,030
cannabis and we need new equipment we me

170
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,160
we need a piece of equipment that is

171
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:52,829
designed for the regulated cannabis

172
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,530
market that has the characteristics of

173
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:57,659
an agricultural sprayer and it just it

174
00:06:55,529 --> 00:07:00,959
doesn't fit yet it is not here yet

175
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,560
the electrostatic technology is nice but

176
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:07,669
you see it in in a little wonky small

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,860
form or extremely complicated big form

178
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,629
it doesn't it doesn't allow smaller you

179
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,949
know the smaller operator to use some of

180
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:15,540
the technology and I think that's why

181
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,370
you see so much this for the paint

182
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,490
sprayer tech is because it's readily

183
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,530
available and I agree they they they're

184
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,280
not making the products that we need for

185
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:29,309
our industry because it's it's plants

186
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:32,429
but it's different in that you can't use

187
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,829
so many of the other tools prior and I

188
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,990
think that cannabis by nature of the

189
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:39,389
fact that it's epidural layer and and

190
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:44,668
the surface of that is is so convoluted

191
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:47,370
and unique in its composition that it

192
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:49,769
allows it allows you to have a lot of

193
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,600
hiding places tough to get up in the

194
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:54,149
canopies tough to cover and spray

195
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,500
correctly and when the canopy starts to

196
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:58,500
become huge like some of these

197
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,449
operations you're basically just trying

198
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,978
to outrun it you know you're we got

199
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:05,310
that's why you see these shorter day

200
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:07,110
cycles where there's a limit on how long

201
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,240
they're gonna flower these rooms and I

202
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,100
think a lot of that that limit is based

203
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,050
off of how long they can outrun the

204
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,419
problem before it becomes so problematic

205
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,340
they can't get any value at a plant I

206
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:22,370
mean I see a lot of big ops that don't

207
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:25,439
sell flower then we sell concentrate

208
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:28,680
because problems go to production yep

209
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,389
they cleanse it there and it's you know

210
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,969
we all laugh cuz it you know it's it's

211
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:38,309
just so fucking real the cannabis plants

212
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:41,030
it's it's its own little world and and

213
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,619
we we've been saying that for a while

214
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:45,929
but it doesn't mean that you can't take

215
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,940
tech from other industry combined and

216
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:51,389
dial it in but it just has to be done

217
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,950
and we haven't seen that yet and and the

218
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:53,939
thing about agitation that Eric was

219
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,090
talking about it

220
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,250
because I remember a lecture you gave

221
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:02,519
Scott I was at where you were talking

222
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,529
about nematode distribution and how when

223
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,779
you check the nematodes in the beds you

224
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:09,120
saw them all over the place in terms of

225
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,470
number and you realize that it was due

226
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,690
to the fact that the tanks weren't

227
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,700
agitated when they did the application

228
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,590
and what you were getting was no

229
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,950
nematodes in some portion so that all

230
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,899
the nematodes and others and it was it

231
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,270
just highlights that same situation

232
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,740
where everything has to be mixed

233
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:28,169
continuously where you're spraying

234
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,779
liquid with does nothing or you're

235
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:33,120
spraying something that's phyto toxicity

236
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:36,449
which we damages the plant opens it up

237
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,350
to other pathogenic entry and and now

238
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:42,720
you have a whole nother set of problems

239
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,330
exactly yeah whatever scale you're at

240
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,399
the difference between the ends is what

241
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,980
really kills you and so you know what

242
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,019
what Eric experience that this one

243
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,529
particular facility that he stopped by

244
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,480
is that literally changing to the to the

245
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:59,159
appropriate agricultural sprayer within

246
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,039
what couple weeks or something there was

247
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:04,289
noticeable yeah I mean within within a

248
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:07,259
couple weeks so phyto toxicity went down

249
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:10,079
so that's you know that's that's injury

250
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:12,179
due to sunlight and being intensified

251
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,220
through a chemical or compound so you

252
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:16,529
have half the building that's getting an

253
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,790
excessively concentrated solution you

254
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:20,970
got half the building that's getting

255
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:22,769
water none of its getting on top of the

256
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,930
pest and then now because of the paint

257
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:27,179
sprayer handle you're also now when you

258
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:29,250
are spraying you're also missing the

259
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:32,399
pest all together because the droplet

260
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,720
size is too big too big it's like it's

261
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,730
like I guess a good example would be

262
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,950
like shotgun shells so like shotgun

263
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,080
shells come in a single slug they come

264
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,390
in like a six shot and then they come in

265
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,370
like a forty shot so if you shoot that

266
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:47,220
up against the wall the single slug

267
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,519
leaves big gap around it you know and so

268
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,379
a six shot is gonna make six holes but

269
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,199
there's big gaps around it and so as you

270
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:58,200
go down and BB size you cover more

271
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,570
ground and you know that's what's really

272
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,240
missing so us personally for our clients

273
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:06,320
we've been just kind of adapting spray

274
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,820
guns from from you know agricultural

275
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,140
areas to

276
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,270
other pieces of equipment that they like

277
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:13,309
to use right now it's a big Frankenstein

278
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,769
time right now yes Scott when we went to

279
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:18,139
the World Expo together and Scott stop

280
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:27,980
by every booth I had anything to do with

281
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:30,289
spray nozzles things but actually if you

282
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:36,620
ask him what works for pump and sludge

283
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:40,459
they look at you like you're crazy yeah

284
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,620
good no just gonna say so at the at the

285
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,509
expo like what what what were your

286
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,149
learnings there because I know like for

287
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:50,269
example are you still uh are you still a

288
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:52,730
blue mat enthusiast I love blue mats

289
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,529
yeah so for example like you're the one

290
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,269
who introduced everyone the blue mats

291
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:59,179
and you were the champion I mean for

292
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:02,449
everybody I know yeah the carpet area

293
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:03,679
but like so you know and you saw them

294
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,500
and you're like oh my god these

295
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,399
service-specific purpose and so what did

296
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,759
you see

297
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,730
you know your dorky nozzle research like

298
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,870
what what do you see what you learn what

299
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,649
do you think you could apply to this

300
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:21,710
industry well I think you know the

301
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:24,350
overall message is that the current

302
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,690
context of Agriculture is not suited

303
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,750
really to what I'm doing it's it's

304
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,600
suited to using really highly soluble

305
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:35,870
chemicals in water so every piece of

306
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,550
equipment is suited to very water

307
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,100
soluble salt chemicals

308
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:41,509
nutin and so when i would go around to

309
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,100
the different spray people and what Eric

310
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:44,750
was talking about the sludge is like

311
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,430
okay if I want to do something that's

312
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,649
got a little bit of texture to it a

313
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:50,569
little bit of organic something I have

314
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,259
to define it to the chemical people as

315
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,629
sludge

316
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:55,789
you know because most of the chemicals

317
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:58,490
just become a water solution there so

318
00:12:55,789 --> 00:13:00,949
water soluble it looks like water so all

319
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,230
the nozzles all the screens all the

320
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:06,110
filters all the pumps all - everything

321
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,810
is suited to essentially spraying water

322
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,639
and so I would say well what if I wanted

323
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:12,469
to spray a sludge to see if they had any

324
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,279
sort of reaction and they look at me

325
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,899
like the hell what you know and I'm like

326
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,189
well I'm spraying organic products and

327
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:21,049
it has a little bit of a texture to it

328
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,800
so I just used the word sludge to see

329
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:23,329
what you like

330
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:25,849
well nobody wants to spray sludge I'm

331
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,920
like exactly okay so what's the biggest

332
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,860
orifice thing you have and they would

333
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:34,159
pull out okay well if we're you know

334
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,769
dealing with really crummy well water

335
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:39,439
that has silt in it or something this is

336
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:41,929
what we would use and none of that stuff

337
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,690
is anywhere near close to what it would

338
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:47,599
be desirable for spraying compost tea

339
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,779
for example and you know Sarah and I had

340
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,060
to come up with techniques because

341
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:55,070
nothing is really all that suited to

342
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,778
spraying tea at scale so we had to

343
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,209
figure out other techniques to avoid

344
00:13:56,778 --> 00:14:01,039
having to spray tea at scale like we had

345
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,629
to come up with new strategies to solve

346
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,838
the problems that didn't involve tea

347
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:10,278
because it was too complicated you know

348
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,560
and you know I keep kicking around you

349
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:14,269
know building some spec equipment but I

350
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,429
don't want to do everything I want to do

351
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,870
my role you know I want to do analytics

352
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:19,489
I want to do math I don't want to be an

353
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,820
equipment supplier I don't want to make

354
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,820
shit

355
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:30,829
blow mold design on something I had this

356
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,899
little idea years ago and I was like if

357
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:38,509
you want to burn money quick get into

358
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:39,860
R&amp;D yeah exactly but we have a need

359
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:42,049
though and that's the thing it's like

360
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,539
right now people are failing with paint

361
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:46,159
sprayers or you know I say DRAM there

362
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:47,569
the biggest one there's things I like

363
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,000
about it there's a lot I don't like

364
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,640
about their equipment but again you know

365
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,980
the the real issue that I think we've

366
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,620
experienced as cannabis people is you

367
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,079
know we've done we've used damn near

368
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,269
everybody's product and we've seen it

369
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,429
we've tried to help a farm be successful

370
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,319
damn near every product and you know

371
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:08,059
after the project's over I'll reach out

372
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,470
to the manufacturer I'm like hey you

373
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,179
know we were just at this farm for a

374
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,949
week these are the issues that they're

375
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:15,409
having this is what we're quantifying

376
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:16,939
this is the problems we're seeing you

377
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:19,819
know and they respond like who the hell

378
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,440
are you you know it's like well I'm a

379
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,449
person that tries to get people

380
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,360
successful with your product and these

381
00:15:23,448 --> 00:15:29,328
are the things that I regularly see and

382
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,459
so far the only people the only people

383
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:33,708
really that have been receptive to our

384
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,859
feedback has been grass roots fabric

385
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:37,500
pots and

386
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,289
sustainable village which is who sells

387
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,509
the blue mats no other agricultural I

388
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:46,019
think Tyler is actually watching right

389
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:48,120
now yeah what's up time but grassroots

390
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:50,490
has been great they listen to the market

391
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,200
and they make changes and you know

392
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,730
sustainable village those are the people

393
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,230
that sells blue mats out in Colorado

394
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,450
they do the same thing I've had a

395
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,089
running dialogue with Steve from blue

396
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,790
mats for five six years now and they

397
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:04,980
make updates based on what we're seeing

398
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:07,199
in the field and you know there's this

399
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,300
resistance or this like culture like was

400
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,790
being said way at the beginning is you

401
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:14,969
know there's this clashing of cultures

402
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:18,599
and clashing of we're on this team or

403
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,700
you're on the weed team and so far zero

404
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,980
t Brewer manufacturers have been

405
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,690
receptive to our feedback zero spray

406
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,800
manufacturers have been receptive to our

407
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:32,180
feedback and you know at some point

408
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,179
somebody will fiddle those niches but
