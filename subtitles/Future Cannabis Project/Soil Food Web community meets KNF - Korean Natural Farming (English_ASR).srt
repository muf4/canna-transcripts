[Music]

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,948
versus what are we calling it like the

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:19,439
living soil crew or you know the soil

4
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,740
food web crew and kind of how their

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,018
begrudging lis coming to at least

6
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:28,409
acknowledge or accept that there's

7
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,419
something interesting with kind of the

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,210
KNF world whereas initially they

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,380
dismissed it mm-hmm and so can you kind

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:41,160
of talk about what maybe you're like

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,640
what KNF is why the soil food web people

12
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:48,359
maybe initially kind of pooh-poohed it

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,030
and then kind of how they're bridging

14
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:54,628
that gap and maybe coming to accept or

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:58,710
even eventually become enthusiasts yes

16
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:59,968
so basically what we're seeing that one

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,320
of the things that we talk about in

18
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,120
these groups especially groups of

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,579
regenerative farmers because we really

20
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,750
do see a divide between you know the

21
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:12,469
Korean natural farming and the you know

22
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:15,540
food soil web biological protocols and

23
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:17,158
so in that divide like how do we come

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,650
together and how do we acknowledge that

25
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,030
both methods work and where does that

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,040
misinformation and misunderstanding

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,228
happen and what we're realizing is that

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,290
a lot of the people who followed a lot

29
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:31,530
of elaine adams work she's very much a

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,240
staunch proponent of making sure that

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,400
your inputs are what you think that they

32
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,798
are and making sure that things don't go

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,359
anaerobic because anaerobic is generally

34
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,360
bad and generally you get pathogenic

35
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,328
things happening and it's it can quickly

36
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,969
become a problem so when you talk with

37
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:50,008
people who you know kind of believe in

38
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:52,739
that mentality what they're thinking is

39
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,769
that Korean natural farming is a ferment

40
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:58,319
and since it's not an aerated situation

41
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:01,349
it's going anaerobic and therefore an

42
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,758
aerobics are bad but when you talk to

43
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:04,319
the Korean natural farming and you start

44
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,989
getting into this you see that it's not

45
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,848
really an anaerobic process it's open to

46
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,098
the air you have breathable lids there's

47
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,869
a ferment going on so there's you know

48
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,590
things happening inside with gas

49
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,830
exchange

50
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,209
and I think that as time goes on and

51
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,250
more and more people are going down this

52
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,170
methodology with Korean natural farming

53
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,969
because it's so cool and it's so

54
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:26,479
effective and it's just a really fun

55
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:30,090
process to get into they're saying well

56
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:32,488
this works really well and plants aren't

57
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,080
dying and there aren't pathogens so

58
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,950
there must be something to it actually

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,049
and for me I have my microscope so when

60
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,699
I'm making my indigenous microorganism

61
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,920
collections I'm actually looking at it

62
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,208
under the scope so that I do know what

63
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,969
I'm putting in there

64
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,189
my opinion is you know you can go just

65
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:52,409
as easily really wrong with a compost

66
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:55,009
tea as you can with your rotten rice if

67
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,818
you don't know what your basis of your

68
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,859
microorganisms are that are in there

69
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:01,078
doesn't really matter which method you

70
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,910
do you could blow it on either side you

71
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,170
can do things different ways and still

72
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,389
have it work out and still have it be

73
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:07,738
beneficial just maybe not exactly how

74
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,878
you thought of it originally

75
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:14,340
can you talk kind of with each

76
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:16,139
methodology what could go wrong and and

77
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,180
what like what are you actually seeing

78
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:22,919
under the microscope like when someone

79
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,469
messes up the KNF process can you tell

80
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,659
me which microbes are showing up to the

81
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:30,090
party I actually can't tell you which

82
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,209
microbes because the microbes are still

83
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,709
so small that even with our shadow

84
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:37,829
microscopes that we're using we we don't

85
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:40,439
know which ones they are necessarily but

86
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:44,459
I have definitely had inoculation zuv

87
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:46,739
bad fungi like they're clearer they're

88
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,129
thinner they don't have a uniformity to

89
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:53,250
them they don't have these septums that

90
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:55,289
separate them so what you want with your

91
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,680
beneficial fungi is like a big fat

92
00:03:55,289 --> 00:04:01,289
mycelium that's dark in color has little

93
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,849
walls basically in between them and is

94
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:05,879
uniform throughout the whole thing and

95
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:08,030
of a large size so if I have that I know

96
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,348
that I'm pretty good to go

97
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,329
learning other things that can be

98
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:14,039
pathogenic like what a Fusarium spore

99
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,470
looks like is a really good one to know

100
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,469
so if you see tons of those you know you

101
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,090
have a problem if you end up with a ton

102
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,890
of Scilly it's swimming around that's

103
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,709
usually not a very good indicator that's

104
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,379
an indicator of an anaerobic condition

105
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,120
and that's more on

106
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:31,389
compost tea side that we see that rather

107
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,250
than on Korean natural farming and yeah

108
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:34,449
I mean with most of the firmaments that

109
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,540
we're making I mean it just looks like

110
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,159
you know happy bubbly things so as funny

111
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,430
as you mentioned ciliates and i remember

112
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,740
the first time i you know looked at

113
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,959
stuff under the microscope and I saw

114
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,939
these microbes whizzing around and they

115
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,859
looked so cool and I was so proud of

116
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:54,670
them and I filmed it and I put it up on

117
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,680
YouTube and people were like those are

118
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,670
those are an indication of an anaerobic

119
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,319
environment that was like yeah yep I

120
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,879
think my first flageolet I found I

121
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,829
followed it for like half an hour I got

122
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:09,790
the worst kink in my neck I was like

123
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:12,250
this is so cool oh my gosh but

124
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:15,220
flageolets are good you just talked

125
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,199
about kind of after you go through the

126
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,530
KNF process what you're looking for

127
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:25,740
under the microscope to see if you did

128
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:30,219
well or poorly in in like brewing teas

129
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,019
which is an aerobic activity what are

130
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,470
you looking for into the microscope in

131
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:39,399
terms of I'm gonna put this on my plants

132
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,630
or not so when I'm doing my compost teas

133
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:42,370
I'm looking for something different

134
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:45,219
because we use a lot of our own

135
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,639
earthworm castings so ideally what I

136
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,380
want there is I want some of those

137
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,779
larger microorganisms so I want some

138
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:54,490
testate amoebae in there I would love to

139
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:56,679
see a nematode but those usually aren't

140
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,910
in the compost tea but you know if

141
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,230
you're there in the compost or if

142
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,300
they're in your soil like that's a

143
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,850
really good sign as long as it's a you

144
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,060
know bacteria eating or I've never seen

145
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:10,330
the omnivorous nematodes I've only seen

146
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,620
the bacterial feeders and I don't think

147
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,449
I've ever seen a root feeder which is

148
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,350
really good says something that we're

149
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:16,810
doing something right with our

150
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,330
composting process and our our earthworm

151
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,769
castings but definitely looking for

152
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:22,990
those tests date amoebas still looking

153
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:25,329
for the beneficial fungi and then

154
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,040
there's a way to do your counts where

155
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:29,079
you're counting how many microbes in

156
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,050
each slide and you're figuring out what

157
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:34,418
your you know call informing colony

158
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,600
forming unit CF use are things like that

159
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:39,339
I usually don't go that deep into it

160
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,290
because you know I see my

161
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:48,668
J and I say Miami BAM I'm a happy camper

162
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:51,160
so I think of these two processes when

163
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:53,409
you're making compost teas do you kind

164
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,240
of have different brews for different

165
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,100
stages of plant growth like maybe you'll

166
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,970
do more fungal dominant in the early

167
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:03,220
stages and you know progressively move

168
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,530
towards more bacterial dominant and then

169
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,590
certain specific bacteria maybe at the

170
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:13,000
end that are known pathogen fighters and

171
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:15,310
then with KN F is it kind of are you

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,189
dialing things in the same way that you

173
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:21,310
do with tears I actually dial it more

174
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:23,500
with with KN f than I do with the t's so

175
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,629
the t's I want it fungal e dominant

176
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,449
always if I can get it there

177
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:31,180
we know that cannabis really responds

178
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:34,329
well to like up to a 30 to 1 fungal to

179
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,579
bacterial ratio so that's a really

180
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,959
really great thing to to see is make

181
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:41,469
sure that you have that fungi in there

182
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,599
all the time and then with compost teas

183
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,280
a lot of that we temper it with you know

184
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,560
like a little more heavy on the nitrogen

185
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,500
side like green grasses or something

186
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,259
like that or we'll add some fish amino

187
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,910
acids or fish hydrolysate at not we

188
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:57,009
won't brew that into it but we'll add it

189
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:01,950
in when we're using it for our drenches

190
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:03,969
and then with kns you get it's it's more

191
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:06,189
so Korean natural farming is

192
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,200
traditionally a foliar method it's not

193
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:10,000
meant to be a soil drench you have your

194
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,639
indigenous microorganisms you inoculate

195
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,259
the soil with those but all of your

196
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,990
ferments that you're making are just for

197
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:18,579
foliar so it's a little bit different

198
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,728
because what we're finding is that

199
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:23,800
cannabis it doesn't quite have the same

200
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:25,750
nutrient cycling that like a tomato does

201
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,098
so tomatoes go through some very

202
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,360
distinctive phases it goes through

203
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:29,860
flower it goes through you know

204
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,139
vegetative and then it puts on flowers

205
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,750
and puts on fruits and then it dies but

206
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:36,490
with cannabis we don't ever really let

207
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,870
it do the fruiting part because we want

208
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,479
it to be sinsemilla so we're not

209
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,490
pollinating it so you just see it's got

210
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,209
it's got a different kind of rhythm to

211
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,740
it especially when it comes to what

212
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:50,588
we're using and when we're using it so

213
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,169
we're finding that and a lot of us have

214
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:53,149
found it

215
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:54,679
things you know some of us like to

216
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,419
continue spraying some of our sprays

217
00:08:54,679 --> 00:09:00,169
further into flowers some of us like to

218
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:02,419
do it you know end it later one of our

219
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:04,669
one of the farmers that we speak with

220
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:06,588
does turns it into a drench at the end

221
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:10,069
so he stops foliar feeding and starts

222
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:12,170
drenching the soil instead which I've

223
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,180
done also when I started Korea natural

224
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:17,269
farming I didn't know it was a foliar so

225
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:19,099
I was using it as a soil trench which

226
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:21,500
worked really well but as a foliar it

227
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,879
works much better and a lot of that has

228
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,220
to do with when you're using your sea

229
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,948
water your water soluble calcium and

230
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,699
your water soluble calcium phosphate

231
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:30,379
normally they're used at very specific

232
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,939
times but we're finding with cannabis

233
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:34,639
you kind of have to tweak it a little

234
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,380
bit more and really read what your plant

235
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,379
wants and because it's a full year it

236
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:40,789
picks it up and responds very quickly so

237
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:48,828
does that imply that you kind of have a

238
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:50,778
mixed process of what's your that's hope

239
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:53,208
yeah that's what we did a lot of last

240
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:55,970
year we did have one area of our garden

241
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:57,859
that was strictly KNF and then the rest

242
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,949
of it we kind of did a mishmash of the

243
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,528
two and so this year were actually

244
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:05,539
really excited we've got our 8,000

245
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:08,328
square foot full term outdoor garden

246
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:11,088
that's gonna be separated into eight to

247
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:13,429
ten different cultivars each one will

248
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:15,800
have 10 to 12 plants and we're gonna

249
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:18,049
split it right down the in two-thirds

250
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,909
one-third is gonna be strictly Korean

251
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:22,278
natural farming so we'll do indigenous

252
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:25,698
microorganisms on the soil will do a

253
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:27,470
liquid indigenous microorganism extract

254
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:30,528
at a few different times during the

255
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,920
cycle and then Korean national farming

256
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:35,838
implements for the all the foliar the

257
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:39,110
other far side we're going to do a

258
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,959
strict food soil web system so we're

259
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,720
gonna use compost compost teas some

260
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:46,250
fulvic acid as a full year after the

261
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,528
compost tea and I believe that's gonna

262
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,929
be about it on that one and then in the

263
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:52,730
middle we're gonna do both so I'm going

264
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:54,708
to use indigenous microorganisms and

265
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:58,819
compost tea and compost tea extract and

266
00:10:54,708 --> 00:11:01,009
liquid IMO for the for the soil and then

267
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:02,990
for the foliar we'll do a combination

268
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:05,659
also of the compost tea and

269
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,430
KNF and we'll just kind of take it out

270
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:09,889
through the year and see what happens at

271
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:14,659
the end you've already gone through a

272
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:17,330
season with KNF correct yes and can you

273
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:20,750
give us kind of a a can you distinguish

274
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:23,570
between like pre-k NF and post KF and

275
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,940
turnt like what have you looked for or

276
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,459
noticed have you had any more bountiful

277
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,520
harvest more terpenes less pathogens

278
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:34,399
what's what are you looking for and and

279
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,000
what's happened as a result of adopting

280
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:41,690
KNF methods um we've definitely seen

281
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,950
higher resin production so we were I've

282
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:48,110
been very impressed by just the overall

283
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,820
quantity of the resin is way higher than

284
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,589
we've seen in the past which I was

285
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,629
really fairly surprised about actually

286
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,370
so frenchie can only we'll be very happy

287
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:58,549
yes French would be right she's gonna

288
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:07,500
love KF when he gets into it destroy

289
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:09,909
those tri-coat everything for the hash

290
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,120
[Laughter]

291
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:15,860
so lots more tricone production

292
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,450
healthier plants overall they were just

293
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,089
easier they just seemed to be more

294
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,670
resistant to kind of everything we did

295
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:25,490
have thrips last year which was the

296
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:27,559
first time and I'm I'm sure I manifested

297
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,909
it on accident because I heard the rips

298
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,979
were coming back to cannabis and I was

299
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:32,870
like drips we haven't seen thrips in

300
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,970
cannabis since like the 80s that's crazy

301
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,589
what I was gonna be my question is that

302
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:40,250
something that was unique to you or was

303
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:43,339
that endemic to kind of humble overall

304
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:46,190
to the cannabis industry overall like

305
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:49,490
thrips kind of hit everyone last year a

306
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,930
little bit more than you know then than

307
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,230
we expected or than I've seen in a

308
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:56,359
really long time and I happen to know

309
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,129
Suzanne Wainwright who's one of the lead

310
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,079
entomologists for the United States for

311
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:01,519
horticulture most she used to be in like

312
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,269
hanging baskets and cut flower industry

313
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,819
and as she sees more of how much

314
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:09,559
cannabis really needs some help with

315
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,500
their integrated pest management plans

316
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:15,559
and you know IPM strategies she's come

317
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,778
into this space and so I actually you

318
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,789
know caught these little thrips and put

319
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:21,679
them in this little vial and sent them

320
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:23,360
off to her and it's a brand new species

321
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,059
of thrips that is all over the west

322
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,980
coast well and I don't know if it's a

323
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:31,088
thrip specifically but I remember there

324
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:34,459
was something that was unleashed

325
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:35,990
somewhere north of you know you're

326
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:39,169
shaking your head but you know the story

327
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:42,860
I'm telling to combat something else

328
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:44,809
yeah but is that a false it's a really

329
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,610
bad rumor it's this is this is one of

330
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:48,528
those rumors that just makes me cringe a

331
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,769
little bit because it got so widespread

332
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:54,948
and it took me maybe 10 minutes of

333
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:57,649
googling to find the information so what

334
00:13:54,948 --> 00:14:00,948
it is is that Caltrans workers created

335
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:04,578
this biological assay to combat star

336
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:07,328
thistle and tumbleweed and there were

337
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:09,229
yeah there were two different predator

338
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:11,299
not predator there were two different

339
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,690
pests that they released and one of them

340
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:16,458
was a type of might but it was a grecian

341
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,720
gall mite I believe or a grecian blister

342
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,819
might I can't quite remember exactly

343
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,970
what it was totally different species

344
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:26,420
totally different you know very very

345
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:28,278
different animal altogether and somebody

346
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:30,169
found out about that and went oh my gosh

347
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:31,578
Caltrans released mites and that's

348
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,979
basically where that whole thing came

349
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:36,019
from but it's not the same mite the hemp

350
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,420
Russert mite is very specific to

351
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:40,490
cannabis it doesn't go to other plants

352
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,860
so people worry about like oh it's gonna

353
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,389
go to my tomatoes and live on my

354
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,740
tomatoes and I'll never get rid of it

355
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,120
and then it'll you know move back and

356
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,159
forth it doesn't actually work that way

357
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,120
hem press it my it's very much a hemp

358
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:55,278
recipe exactly

359
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,980
the proud canvas enthusiast it's not

360
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:01,278
like vegetables okay so it seems like

361
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:04,789
thrips hit everyone yeah nobody was

362
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,860
spared how did it like when you were

363
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:08,689
talking to other cultivators who weren't

364
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,419
using some of the methodologies that you

365
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,149
were using kind of what was the the

366
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:18,319
comparison and the damage done or the

367
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:20,089
plants rigorous defense against the

368
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,160
pests yeah I mean that is the

369
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:24,860
interesting thing that I hadn't really

370
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,948
thought about too much most people with

371
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,230
their thrips

372
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:30,479
it damaged the plants pretty bad I mean

373
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,209
we had them pretty bad it was they were

374
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,519
like you know it was not hard to find

375
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,988
some to put in a little jar but we don't

376
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,369
really like spring pesticides or

377
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:39,899
anything and we were getting close to

378
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:42,809
the end of the run so we were just like

379
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,578
well you know we'll just kind of I don't

380
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,858
know wash them down with water and you

381
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:48,778
know try and mitigate and manage them a

382
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:51,509
little bit but the interesting thing is

383
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:53,009
the end result flower was still really

384
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:56,188
good I mean we still had really great

385
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:58,350
nutrient uptake the plants didn't really

386
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,909
suffer at all I mean unless you got up

387
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,220
close he couldn't really even tell there

388
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:04,198
was that much of a problem and we did do

389
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,859
a lot of predatory releases we released

390
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:08,969
aureus which is a my new pirate bug is

391
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:09,389
what it's called and so that's a

392
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,609
predator

393
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:15,028
we released a predatory wasp and then we

394
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:17,850
released them my new pirate bug both to

395
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:19,558
kind of help us combat them and it took

396
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,168
down the population it made it

397
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:24,088
manageable but it didn't again it didn't

398
00:16:22,168 --> 00:16:27,149
seem to impact the plants terribly

399
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:30,959
detrimental II so so your main strategy

400
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:32,159
was predatory bugs mm-hmm yeah did you

401
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,359
have any friends who had other

402
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:38,789
strategies that were effective or people

403
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,850
still kind of like to pretend like

404
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:43,139
things happen that didn't so like I know

405
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,360
a friend there was like oh we totally

406
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,100
got rid of our threats of like by I

407
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,808
think they use doctors AIIMS or

408
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,548
something and I was like that's awesome

409
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:52,909
and then when I looked at you know one

410
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:56,399
of the leaves them all no you didn't

411
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:59,100
like almost like everybody feels shame

412
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:03,028
yeah yeah I want to just come out and

413
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,409
say we all got it yeah I have no shame

414
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm like people are like Oh have you

415
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:06,839
ever dealt with russets I'm like oh yeah

416
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,399
plenty of times

417
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:10,078
of course I mean any time you bring a

418
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:12,208
plant onto your property you're probably

419
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,178
bringing russets in but the great thing

420
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:16,828
is if you deal with them once generally

421
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,259
that's all it takes to get really good

422
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:21,000
on your quarantine process and then

423
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:22,888
after that you're like oh whatever

424
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,480
russets aren't a big deal spider mites

425
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:33,569
easy to take care of the West Side Story

426
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,149
yeah two gangs in the West Side Story or

427
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:38,009
the Bloods and the Crips or any the

428
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:42,929
Celtics and the Lakers

429
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:45,869
being from Boston what would you say to

430
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:51,570
kind of the living soy or the soil food

431
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:53,309
web cam to to get them to give KF a

432
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:56,939
chance like what are some of the

433
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:59,129
compelling arguments you know it's

434
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,019
really there's a I actually just spoke

435
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,180
with somebody at one of our regenerative

436
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:06,289
conference because point me two years or

437
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:09,779
how many years ago did you do zero kfm

438
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:14,690
yeah four years ago so it's only been

439
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:17,700
three years for you so talk about the

440
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,200
finding Jesus and I will be honest like

441
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,569
when I first heard about it I was like

442
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,019
Korean natural farming but we're not in

443
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:27,569
Korea like we're using rice to collect

444
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:29,480
our indigenous microorganisms but we

445
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:32,039
don't have right like we don't grow rice

446
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,250
and I'm like Locke California does grant

447
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,690
rice but um but at the beginning I was

448
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,069
kind of like I don't know about this

449
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:43,650
this seems like pretty bizarre to me and

450
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:45,210
what turned for me was we went out to

451
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,550
the beach and I collected a bunch of

452
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,319
seaweed and I was talking with my friend

453
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:51,149
Layton who's a scientist on the East

454
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,429
Coast and I was like okay so I have all

455
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,350
this seaweed like I'm kind of thinking

456
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,580
should i dry it out and like pulverize

457
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:58,079
it and like how much work do I really

458
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:00,059
want to do on this maybe I'll just dump

459
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,199
it in the compost should I feed it to my

460
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,849
earthworms I don't know what do you

461
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,250
think Laden and he's like you know what

462
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:08,579
you should do you should ferment it and

463
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,589
it was like oh boy are you going down

464
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:12,059
the rabbit hole - he's like I am I've

465
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:13,529
gone down the K enough rabbit hole I'm

466
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,000
going deep it's pretty interesting

467
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:16,079
actually like why don't you just just

468
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,950
try it just give it a shot see what

469
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:23,069
happens so I took the seaweed that we

470
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:26,039
had which was a bladder wrack and it was

471
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:28,319
the weirdest thing and I loved it it

472
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,839
turned into this like when you poured it

473
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:34,589
it was like thick yeasty cake batter

474
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:37,289
almost and it was like kind of slimy and

475
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:39,599
gooey and it was just so fun to play

476
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:42,269
with and by the time the ferment was

477
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:45,209
done I was like okay if this is this

478
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:48,029
much fun like if this is this cool I

479
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,669
have to learn more about it and and then

480
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:51,618
just started using it and

481
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:53,419
for me I really like the fact that these

482
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:55,699
are all inputs that are made for our

483
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:57,229
human body as well so as soon as I

484
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,778
started getting into that and I made our

485
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:02,359
first or oriental herbal nutrient or o

486
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:05,509
hn and started taking that internally I

487
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:07,189
was like man this stuff is gold this we

488
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:08,929
do not my family doesn't get sick

489
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,129
anymore I have a four year old and an

490
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:12,589
eight year old and I guarantee you

491
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:14,748
they're swimming in germs the only one

492
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:17,118
who got a cold in the last two years

493
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:19,669
pretty much has been my four-year-old

494
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:21,348
who doesn't like the Oh HN and myself

495
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:23,119
when I was on vacation and forgot to

496
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:24,678
bring it with me and I knew I that my

497
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:26,868
kids were sick and I was like aha man

498
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,269
but you know it's just like wow if this

499
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:32,148
if this can help the human body this

500
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:34,009
much against pathogens and diseases and

501
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:37,518
things like it's got to be good for our

502
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:39,769
plants and so just you know started

503
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,058
using it pretty minimally at the

504
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:42,229
beginning and again like I said when I

505
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:44,598
first started I didn't know it was a

506
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:48,139
full year so I was like you know making

507
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:50,598
a big huge vat with a had some fpj and

508
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:52,758
some Oh HN and a little bit of thought

509
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:55,249
about was I putting it at the time brown

510
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,719
rice vinegar and I didn't have recipes I

511
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:58,489
was just kind of going off what people

512
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:59,558
were saying online so I was just kind of

513
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:03,078
well that's what I was gonna ask man

514
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:05,118
what was kind of your original recipe

515
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:08,808
and then kind of what's the iterative

516
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:10,368
improvement of that yeah the I don't

517
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:12,648
think they even had an original recipe

518
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:14,148
honestly I was just like you know how

519
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:15,768
much do we put in guys people like I

520
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:17,958
don't know try this much and we're like

521
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:21,019
okay Oh an L a B that was the other one

522
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:23,899
actually Li B was our first first foray

523
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:25,548
into can F so that's lactic acid

524
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:27,528
bacteria serum so you're basically

525
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:28,999
taking milk and you're letting it kind

526
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:30,709
of ferment and turn into curds and whey

527
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:33,499
and then you take the curds off and

528
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:36,528
you're left with this beautiful la B

529
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:40,159
that is just phenomenal I mean like we

530
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:42,648
had a micronutrient deficiency I think

531
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,690
that's what it was at some point there

532
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:46,248
was something going on and that was all

533
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,719
we had made because that was the first

534
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:50,598
thing I tried and I was like this was

535
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:51,709
easy like let's do this more and my

536
00:21:50,598 --> 00:21:53,838
husband was like well what do we do with

537
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:55,070
it now and I'm like I don't know what do

538
00:21:53,838 --> 00:21:56,868
we do with the people when people are

539
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:59,679
like I don't know water it in we're like

540
00:21:56,868 --> 00:22:01,839
okay so we did and with

541
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,660
two days we saw that micronutrient

542
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,129
deficiency just disappear and I still

543
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,630
like I mean you know I'm going from

544
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,390
memory from a couple years back so I

545
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,490
don't know for certain what exactly else

546
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,800
was happening but I was just like okay

547
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,920
this is cool and so then playing with

548
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,190
things finally last year I went to Boise

549
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,250
Idaho and studied under Chris Trump and

550
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,500
that was where everything started really

551
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,750
making sense because you leave there

552
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,009
with this beautiful sheet of recipes and

553
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,109
you leave with all this intrinsic

554
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:34,599
knowledge about how to use each recipe

555
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:36,729
and when to use it and in what ratios

556
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:38,169
and it's like okay how do you make

557
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,730
fermented seawater and why do you want

558
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,640
to do that and what do you use it for

559
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,440
and so then getting to come back and

560
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,960
really start implementing that and doing

561
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,549
it the right way and then having a

562
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,340
background in growing cannabis and

563
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:53,019
knowing how to see nutrient deficiencies

564
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:54,369
and be like oh I have the input for that

565
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:56,139
that's gonna be a little bit of this and

566
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:57,639
a little bit of that so we'll kind of

567
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,040
you know there's some blending of

568
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,930
recipes that does happen now just

569
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:03,609
because I've done it enough where I know

570
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,320
like okay this I know this needs

571
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:07,959
potassium and I know that water soluble

572
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:10,599
calcium phosphate phosphate pardon me

573
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,340
and I know that WC AP as our phosphate

574
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:14,469
for this so I know that I'm going to add

575
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:17,079
that but we're not in this particular

576
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,900
stage of development so we're gonna add

577
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,389
it to this one instead and then I also

578
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,550
love doing the side-by-sides so that's

579
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:27,730
been really eye-opening this year as

580
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:31,990
well we did our seed so treatment and I

581
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:33,640
did the same seeds same cultivar started

582
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,460
them in the same soils the whole nine

583
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,320
yards and I did the SES which is our

584
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,740
main institutions or a seed so treatment

585
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:44,019
I did plain water and then a few years

586
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,819
back I'd soaked in a fulvic acid

587
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:48,190
solution and it worked really well I got

588
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:50,529
really much faster germination a better

589
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:52,600
germination rate so I was like well if

590
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,920
SES is good and fulvic acid was good I

591
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:57,719
should add them together and then it'll

592
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,860
be like gangbusters absolutely incorrect

593
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,750
absolutely incorrect I was shocked we

594
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:04,990
got the worst germination rate worse

595
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:07,240
than plain water and the plants did not

596
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,920
grow as fast right now I've got some

597
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,319
pictures up on our Instagram that shows

598
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,840
you can see this was SES and this is SES

599
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:15,549
and fulvic the ones that we had just the

600
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,500
straight korean natural farming darker

601
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:18,909
green they don't have any leaf drop

602
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,309
showing they're not picking up any

603
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:23,529
micronutrient deficiencies the ones that

604
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:25,240
had fulvic acid added and this is months

605
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:28,269
ago months ago they've been treated the

606
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,039
same ever since micronutrient

607
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:32,200
deficiencies lighter green is having a

608
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:33,519
harder time with up taking nitrogen the

609
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,920
bottoms of lilies are yellowing and

610
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,079
following off I mean it's it's just like

611
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,480
I was like wow this is so cool

612
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,069
to actually see this and you know do a

613
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,289
side by side and really know that like

614
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:46,240
it's been developed a certain way and

615
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:52,359
it's probably perfect the way it is for

616
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:55,390
the most part yes like these two drugs

617
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:58,259
should not be together yeah and we found

618
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:01,660
it was even worse for our loofah sponges

619
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:04,240
so the loofah sponges was an 85 percent

620
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,830
germination rate I think yeah I think

621
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,839
was 85 percent is what we ended with

622
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:10,929
with the SES and they started

623
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,369
germinating within like 24 hours loofah

624
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,259
sponges can take two up to three months

625
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:18,000
for these seeds to germinate I was like

626
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:21,220
oh this is really fast the plain water

627
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,410
we had I think 80% germination rate but

628
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,420
they were last I measured they were a

629
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:28,300
good two and a half inches shorter in

630
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,279
average height than the SES and the SES

631
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:33,190
and fulvic we had a 40% germination rate

632
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:37,089
and they just kind of like grew up and

633
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:41,350
fell over I was like okay good to know

634
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:42,849
that was that was not a wise choice spj

635
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:45,189
I think is a really good one for people

636
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:48,189
to start with it's really easy it's

637
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:51,279
pretty hard to mess up FPGAs ferment and

638
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:53,170
plant juice so basically the only

639
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,490
difficulty with that one is that you're

640
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,980
supposed to be up in the morning before

641
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,720
the Sun touches your plants and you want

642
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,370
to just take the growing tips of your

643
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,370
plants not the whole plant not the roots

644
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:06,519
if you go off information online or in

645
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:08,409
old books there's all kinds of different

646
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:10,180
ways to do it that are not the right way

647
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,680
and one of the first ones I made had

648
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,140
like the roots and it was like not the

649
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,180
soil off but you know gently it's okay

650
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:20,410
if it's in there and turns out that no

651
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,970
that's not really a good idea but yeah

652
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,580
like I said we do our fpga

653
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:27,700
with seaweed so that has this whole

654
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:29,769
different profile than like the growing

655
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,809
mustard tips from the you know wild

656
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:34,480
mustard that's in our yard a lot of

657
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:36,849
people do FPGAs out of aloe vera so

658
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,370
there's just you know it's just it's so

659
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:40,929
widely diverse and it's so easy to do

660
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:43,689
it's a great one for people to start

661
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:46,570
getting into but you never spray fpj

662
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,980
alone so you always have to at least add

663
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:51,159
your Oh H n which is your oriental

664
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:54,039
herbal nutrient and that's a tincture so

665
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:57,009
you have Angelica garlic ginger cinnamon

666
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:59,470
and licorice and you ferment it first

667
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:01,269
with either sugar or sugar and beer and

668
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:04,180
then you do a tincture and you stir it

669
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:06,220
every day for three months and you do

670
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,720
different five different extractions and

671
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,049
at the end you end up with this really

672
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,370
amazing nutrient solution that's really

673
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:14,079
healthy for you and it's really healthy

674
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:16,649
for the plants and when you add it to

675
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,879
your fpj it just creates this beautiful

676
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,920
microbial colonies on your plants that

677
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,200
make it extremely resistant to pests and

678
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:26,500
diseases and are you applying a

679
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:31,569
consistent concoction throughout the

680
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:36,220
lifecycle or like the what was the first

681
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:38,950
one fpj o hn f pj and o hn you basically

682
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:42,039
create those two solutions you mix them

683
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:45,069
and then that's kind of your foliar

684
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:48,539
spray for the entire process or are you

685
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:51,339
adding other things at certain points

686
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,869
yeah you can use that that's that's the

687
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:57,039
maintenance spray so it's brown rice

688
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:58,059
vinegar o HN and fpj your F PJ's I have

689
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,889
one too

690
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:01,929
let's see FPGA is one two five hundred I

691
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,240
think and then Oh H n is one to a

692
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,890
thousand and brown rice vinegar is one

693
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,109
to one thousand so you're using very

694
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,420
very minut amounts of this maintenance

695
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:12,549
spray you can use up to once a week any

696
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,350
time doesn't matter but what you really

697
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:16,839
want to do is dial into your life cycle

698
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:18,459
and the nutrient cycling of the plant so

699
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:20,289
if you're at the beginning in the

700
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,930
vegetative stage then you want to add

701
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:25,809
some other things to it so FA a which is

702
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:28,690
your fish amino acid so that takes about

703
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:30,250
three to six months at least to make so

704
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,660
a lot of these are processes that you

705
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,169
know you have to really start them and

706
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,200
this is all

707
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:36,970
foliar fullier yep yep so you want to

708
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,249
start some of these way ahead of time in

709
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,200
a pinch we've used fish hydrolysate

710
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:44,259
instead of FAA because we didn't have it

711
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,450
but and then you have your water soluble

712
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:48,548
calcium and you have a water soluble

713
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,350
calcium phosphate and those are used at

714
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:52,118
different times to see if your

715
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:55,148
maintenance solution good to go anytime

716
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:57,908
you have a vegetative growth solution

717
00:28:55,148 --> 00:29:00,668
you have a you know flowering or

718
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:04,330
finishing fruiting solution you have a

719
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:06,038
changeover solution so that's generally

720
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:08,439
used like if you were doing light

721
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:09,878
deprivation or an indoor you'd use that

722
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,528
during your transition phase which is

723
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:14,769
usually about a week before your light

724
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:17,558
cycle changes in a week into it and then

725
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:20,200
you also there's a ripening formula a

726
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:21,999
ripening enhancement formula that we've

727
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,499
just kind of started playing with in

728
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:26,980
tinkering with a little bit and seeing

729
00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:28,868
how to use it and when to use it and you

730
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,389
know what the effects are yeah and what

731
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:32,589
the effects are because that's the key

732
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:34,508
so that's when those control groups

733
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:36,398
really come into play like if you put it

734
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:37,569
on everything you don't really know what

735
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:39,699
worked and what didn't because you put

736
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:42,220
it on everything but if I know that this

737
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,499
plant got it and this plant didn't or

738
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,899
this section did and this section didn't

739
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:48,608
and I have that control group I can come

740
00:29:46,898 --> 00:29:50,858
back and really say listen this isn't

741
00:29:48,608 --> 00:29:53,230
subjective this isn't means thinking

742
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:55,658
that this has a better terpene profile

743
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,519
or that this was more pest resistant

744
00:29:55,659 --> 00:30:00,129
this is me actually having data to prove

745
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,169
it and I think that the cannabis

746
00:30:00,128 --> 00:30:05,498
industry has a very difficult time

747
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:07,359
collecting some relevant data because we

748
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:09,129
get excited about things and we just go

749
00:30:07,358 --> 00:30:10,480
you know hog-wild and do it on

750
00:30:09,128 --> 00:30:13,388
everything and we forget about the fact

751
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,919
that we now really don't don't have

752
00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:18,189
anything to show that it actually did

753
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:20,139
what we think it did so I I'm a big

754
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,389
proponent of like at least just at least

755
00:30:20,138 --> 00:30:24,069
you know a few of them leave them alone

756
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:25,628
and see what happens and make sure that

757
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:29,230
it is doing what it's you know what you

758
00:30:25,628 --> 00:30:32,319
think it's doing it seems like nutrients

759
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:36,278
are there is nutrient intake through the

760
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:38,589
leaves mm-hmm yeah absolutely okay

761
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:41,079
which is why KNF is so cool for cannabis

762
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:43,509
because it is so responsive like you

763
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:44,769
really you do really see changes in a

764
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,390
day or two men

765
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:48,220
if you're doing if you're doing it right

766
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,080
and if you're doing it wrong you'll see

767
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,309
that pretty quickly - which is nice

768
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,230
because then you can bounce back and be

769
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:55,990
like okay fix it with that whoops

770
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,610
so you could I mean as an example just

771
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,069
to test things out you could have like

772
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:02,859
soil that's deficient in some critical

773
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:05,829
nutrient and you're providing these

774
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:08,319
foliar sprays where the plant will the

775
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:10,480
leaves won't turn yellow the plants like

776
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,159
I'm still cool yeah like I may not be

777
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,339
getting it through the roots I'm getting

778
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,990
the suppository or so like I'm not

779
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:20,589
getting the suppository but it's still

780
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:23,019
it's still doing its job and then Korean

781
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:25,750
natural farming also does implement a

782
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:28,480
living soil very much so indigenous

783
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:31,450
microorganisms is like the base of it so

784
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,750
without that you have a harder time I

785
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:37,539
mean we did one in I think I had a

786
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,950
little isolated bed that didn't have you

787
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:41,259
know the soil wasn't great it was

788
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,150
there's one the ends of one of our beds

789
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:44,559
it's just always lacking it still can't

790
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:47,530
figure out what's going on down there

791
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:50,159
but those ones even with the Korean

792
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:53,470
natural farming they were lacking so

793
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,360
we're gonna do a better inoculation with

794
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,940
our indigenous microorganisms this year

795
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:00,069
and see if that doesn't snap that area

796
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:03,460
out of it but you usually are using

797
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:05,139
these you know mycelial mats to keep

798
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,360
your soils up to health and to keep that

799
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,070
fungal a dominant as well and what do

800
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:12,009
you are you growing and like raised beds

801
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:13,960
or pots or in the ground or all of the

802
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:17,259
above no no pots no pots we don't do

803
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,200
pots anymore so we have raised beds we

804
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:23,109
have mounded they're not like cool you

805
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,640
know Hugo who do gorgeou yeah yes I

806
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:27,729
actually my mother would pronounce it

807
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:32,860
correctly but I love my I have my Hugo

808
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:36,640
beds at home and oh my gosh the water

809
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:39,069
usage on that is insanely small like I

810
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,780
was shocked i watered it one third of

811
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:43,869
the time compared to the rest of my

812
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:45,849
garden I was just like absolutely mind

813
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:47,619
blown it's it's so cool and just the

814
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:50,019
fungal dominance of it I mean I can like

815
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:52,000
dig a sample of soil out and get it

816
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:53,950
under my microscope and immediately find

817
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,930
beneficial fungi it's not sure like you

818
00:32:53,950 --> 00:33:00,539
basically have Roddy

819
00:32:54,930 --> 00:33:03,450
logs yep dank environment yeah so with

820
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:06,000
the raised beds are you like what's kind

821
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:08,160
of the typical dimension of a raised bed

822
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,049
oh gosh everybody does it differently

823
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:14,480
ours happen to be four feet by eighty

824
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:18,359
feet okay

825
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,160
three feet by eighty feet and so

826
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:23,669
basically what you're doing there is

827
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:26,300
you're and so in that eighty feet how

828
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:31,019
many plants are you getting well our

829
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:33,210
well it depends I think that we depends

830
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:35,849
on the size so you know generally are

831
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,590
light depth we're using clones and we're

832
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:39,000
planting them every foot two foot and a

833
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:42,990
half and we have I think two rows that

834
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,579
go down the bed and I know that in the

835
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:46,079
entire five thousand square foot garden

836
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:49,169
we run nine hundred and sixty plants

837
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:51,299
okay and that's in 1/2 that's in 8

838
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:54,029
different beds but I guess where I'm

839
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:55,559
going is is the idea here that like a

840
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:58,379
lot of people historically have done

841
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:01,049
pots where each plants root system is

842
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:04,650
isolated but you kind of want every all

843
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:07,649
the root systems to be partying together

844
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:11,630
and with the microbes and the fun you

845
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:16,500
know the fungal just everything together

846
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:20,670
not like pot one its own ecosystem pot

847
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:22,769
to its own ecosystem like silo siloed

848
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:27,090
ecosystems you want kind of everything

849
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:29,130
and then I guess with like your like

850
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,100
drip irrigation are using like blue Matt

851
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:35,970
or anything like that to kind of keep

852
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:38,699
sort of the the moisture level

853
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:42,539
consistent like you're using tensiometer

854
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:45,779
x' or anything to like so do you get

855
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:47,940
scenarios where like you know the the

856
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,560
warmer sunnier side of the greenhouse

857
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:55,139
maybe is drier in the soil then like the

858
00:34:52,559 --> 00:35:01,529
far end of the greenhouse that's maybe

859
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:03,539
cooler and less light so are in that 180

860
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,160
foot raised bed right so our light

861
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:08,369
deprivation is actually open air

862
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:12,179
we don't have it enclosed so there is no

863
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:14,369
house effect happening we don't tend to

864
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:16,109
see that much of a difference in I mean

865
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:18,719
we do have drip tape irrigation but it's

866
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:21,480
just on a timer and you know we hand

867
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,159
water in our you know our soil drench of

868
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,300
whichever it might be usually at least

869
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:28,769
once or twice a week and really just

870
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,289
yeah I don't see a lot of difference

871
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:33,389
with that and I mean I don't know I'm

872
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:34,710
kind of an old-school farmer people take

873
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:36,329
this they're like oh you got a pH your

874
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,460
water and you gotta get your blue mat on

875
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:40,529
your little thing that measures all that

876
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,659
and I'm like or you could just talk to

877
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,730
your plants and go stick your finger in

878
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:46,980
the dirt and find out what's going on

879
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,110
so generally that's kind of what we do

880
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,639
is we you know watch our plants and we

881
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:55,800
see what they need and we take it as a

882
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:58,199
you know as part of our interaction with

883
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,820
what we do and with what we love to do

884
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:01,799
and I think that makes a difference too

885
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,360
I think it you know you you notice

886
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,220
things a lot faster when you're out

887
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,570
there you know if you're assuming that

888
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:09,629
your blue mats gonna take care of all

889
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,730
your watering needs so that you're you

890
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,619
know doing something else with your time

891
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,179
and you're not in your garden it's

892
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:16,949
really easy to miss those things and all

893
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:19,440
of a sudden you know you see these

894
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:21,389
horrible photos of people with like it's

895
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,670
like aphids like I've seen cannabis

896
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:26,369
covered in Athens and I'm like how did

897
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:28,800
it get to this point like where did that

898
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:32,369
how did you not notice you had a fence

899
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,610
before they were so encrusted that like

900
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:38,369
there's just no salvaging that and when

901
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:40,140
you're out there you know in your plants

902
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:41,670
with your face you know in the leaves

903
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:43,619
and your fingers in the soil and you're

904
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,930
really interacting it's just you you

905
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,949
notice things way faster and that's

906
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:48,149
another great thing with the Curie

907
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:50,339
natural farming is you're in there and

908
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:51,750
you're like oh you know I this is I got

909
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,539
a little bit of a zinc deficiency okay

910
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:56,519
let's see let's go check out our inputs

911
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:58,500
and you know figure out which one of

912
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:59,039
these might have zinc in it and go do a

913
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,590
foliar

914
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:04,279
all right well Wendy I appreciate the

915
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:09,300
time it is probably like 8:30 at night

916
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:11,540
on camera all day and I think we're

917
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,710
gonna do a course out of this right

918
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:18,690
specific video but you're gonna do a

919
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:21,568
seminar a six-week two-hour each week

920
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:24,659
workshop and we're gonna film

921
00:37:21,568 --> 00:37:26,998
and make an online version of it so that

922
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,929
people who don't live in humble - can

923
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:30,808
yeah

924
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:32,999
come enjoy and appreciate so I'm excited

925
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:37,349
for that I'm really excited to teach

926
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:39,418
people cuz that's or one it's a it's

927
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:41,969
really easy to get bad information

928
00:37:39,418 --> 00:37:43,708
online and you know having gone through

929
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:45,059
it myself and really made a lot of

930
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:47,278
errors at the beginning because I'm

931
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:48,959
trying to figure out how to do things

932
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:51,179
and people say oh you'd do it like this

933
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:53,028
and I'm like okay and like no that's

934
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:58,259
actually that's totally not right at all

935
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:59,699
maybe one day helene yes well we we

936
00:37:58,259 --> 00:38:02,099
still meet she'll be in the front row

937
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:03,869
she will be in she'll be like I'll I

938
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:05,548
don't know about this I don't know

939
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:06,899
and then eventually I'll look at her to

940
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:10,489
scope my rice and she'll be like all

941
00:38:06,898 --> 00:38:10,489
okay it looks pretty good

942
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:16,889
[Music]

943
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:20,559
