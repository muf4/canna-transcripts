2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,000
it's an honor to be in the position I am

3
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:16,890
right now and so I'll tell you a little

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,109
bit about what we've been doing the last

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,089
year and what's been happening over the

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,669
last couple weeks as all of you know

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:26,730
last year I was appointed but my

8
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:28,980
responsibility was to put together the

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,259
first state regulatory system for

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,659
medical cannabis and then something

11
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:36,899
happened in November and it changed just

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:40,288
a little bit and our role is expanded to

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:43,558
adult youth also so the Bureau serves as

14
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:46,320
the lead agency on this effort but we're

15
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,669
not doing it alone we also work together

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,378
with the Department of Food and

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,588
Agriculture and Department of Public

18
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,928
Health Food NAG is is they're the ones

19
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:56,670
who are licensing our cultivators Public

20
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,640
Health and manufacturers and then the

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,588
bureau is handling the rest with the

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,838
testing laboratories the distributor's

23
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:06,629
transporters dispensaries and micro

24
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:08,129
businesses so so we've been working

25
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:10,170
pretty hard doing a lot of public

26
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:13,709
outreach happy to be in Orange County

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,710
again because a lot of us all of us from

28
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:19,530
the three agencies one we all started

29
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,419
with practically no staff and as we got

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,239
them on board we need to learn we need

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,340
to learn about cannabis I'll tell you I

32
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,828
came from alcohol and I thought okay

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,320
I'll come do cannabis oh they're so

34
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:33,779
different I always say alcohol is easy

35
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,688
cannabis is more complicated a lot more

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,549
complicated there's a lot of learning a

37
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:41,519
lot of talking to the public and the

38
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,810
industry and seeing what you've been

39
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,670
doing and I think our job you know we've

40
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,439
tried to take an approach that we want

41
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,140
to hear from you and one of the first

42
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,118
things out the gate that really

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,989
surprised me I think was how open

44
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,879
everybody was to telling us about

45
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:01,589
cannabis about their business about

46
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:05,339
their struggles over the last couple

47
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:09,210
decades and I think I didn't expect that

48
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,759
and that has been a tremendous asset to

49
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,540
the three licensing authorities because

50
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,518
unless we

51
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,789
know what you're doing it's really hard

52
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,438
to regulate and regulate in a thoughtful

53
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:22,280
manner and so that's what we've been

54
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:24,780
working on our medical regulations and

55
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,539
along with other things too isn't just

56
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,680
that we're all three standing up an IT

57
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:34,019
system and and we have you know food nag

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,640
has to do an environmental study the

59
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,340
Bureau is also doing an environmental

60
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:41,789
initial study so a lot of things going

61
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,650
on simultaneously and I do I have to ask

62
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:46,548
what what is our aggressive timeline

63
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,539
we're going to be issuing licenses when

64
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:52,769
yeah you guys are supposed to be more

65
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:54,750
excited about that right and I know it

66
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:58,438
sounds really aggressive and what do I

67
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:02,310
keep saying we can do this we've got to

68
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:04,289
do it it's the law right and so a big

69
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,989
part of this list was getting our

70
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:09,269
medical regulations so as most of you

71
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,810
how many is already taking a look at our

72
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:16,319
regulations so far good that's pretty

73
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:19,650
good so for all three of us we came out

74
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,719
with our regulations last Friday and

75
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,908
then we had one straggler that was a

76
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,878
testing laboratory that came out today

77
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:30,090
by the way so that is out on our website

78
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:32,638
right now and we separated the packages

79
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,128
let me tell you having testing labs was

80
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,889
that was the biggest probably challenge

81
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:40,500
is putting together those regulations

82
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:42,870
but what now we're looking at is one

83
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,989
thing we need from you and we don't I

84
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,560
don't take this lightly Cal California

85
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,419
has a very robust rulemaking process and

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,180
I know we talk about we always say

87
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:56,370
regulations or what are regulations well

88
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,430
they're basically the requirements that

89
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,658
we're putting into place for our

90
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,469
everybody that's going to get a license

91
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:05,818
with us so we have the statutes we have

92
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:07,469
proposition 64 we have the medical

93
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:10,078
cannabis and regulation and Safety Act

94
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,848
so now it's it's further defining those

95
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,349
requirements so some of the things that

96
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:15,238
you're going to see in our regulations

97
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:17,969
first of all we're going to define a

98
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,899
whole bunch of things that you see in

99
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,310
the statutes we define them we also have

100
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:26,348
detailed what the application require

101
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,910
so exactly what you're going to see on

102
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:31,000
day one when you fill out an application

103
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,120
and then we go into further things like

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,399
what who's an owner is a spouse and

105
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,699
owner and all of those things what's

106
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,888
priority licensing and and some of the

107
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,379
things then when we went into specific

108
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:47,079
license types and we laid out things for

109
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:49,569
example the dispensaries there's their

110
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,029
requirements for storage and packaging

111
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:54,520
and hours of operation delivery

112
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:56,619
requirements so all those things are in

113
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,149
there but the California rulemaking

114
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,860
process you know I have this question

115
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:02,079
all the time people ask what's taking so

116
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,000
long what you know what's going on you

117
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,609
know and any why don't you just take

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,399
Colorado or Washington regulations and

119
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,199
just copy them and I say well well we

120
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,179
probably don't want to do that not that

121
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,699
they're not good regulations but they're

122
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,560
not those were those were those statutes

123
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:19,449
weren't weren't for California that was

124
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,810
for Colorado and they're very different

125
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:25,960
and the other thing is is when we do the

126
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,968
California rulemaking process is a I'll

127
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,620
tell you it for the regulator is

128
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:32,649
probably difficult but for the public

129
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,110
it's a great thing because of all the

130
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:37,239
feedback that you all the commenting

131
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,919
that you can have on our regulation so

132
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,500
you basically can shape those

133
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:44,379
regulations so what you see right now

134
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,848
are proposed regulations and I I may say

135
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:48,069
that a couple times tonight they're

136
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:51,728
draft or proposed they're by no means

137
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:54,400
final it is our first step of saying

138
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:55,899
okay we've gone about we've we've talked

139
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,370
to other states we've talked to the

140
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:59,198
industry we've talked to local

141
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,360
jurisdictions we've talked to the public

142
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,360
this is what we came up with in addition

143
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,949
to that text we also have to put

144
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,860
together what's called an initial

145
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:12,788
statement of reason for every regulation

146
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:15,669
that we have text for we have to justify

147
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:19,509
why we put it in there you don't see

148
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:21,218
that a lot across the other state so for

149
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:23,590
California if you want to say well why

150
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:26,019
in the heck does the bureau say this you

151
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:28,329
can go back to that initial statement of

152
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,948
reason and say oh that's why they said

153
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:32,859
it now that doesn't mean you're going to

154
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:35,020
agree with us and that's okay

155
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,330
we're okay with you not agreeing with us

156
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:40,990
but what we would like to hear is hey

157
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:43,029
did we get some stuff right hopefully we

158
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,620
got a few things right did we get some

159
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:46,750
where did we get some stuff and we're

160
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,870
not quite there yet well we want to hear

161
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:53,709
that tell us what did we get wrong and

162
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,509
and and then tell us how we can make it

163
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:58,508
better and that's what this is all about

164
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:01,930
this whole public process so right now

165
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:04,538
we're in the 45 day a period for us so

166
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:07,209
from last Friday from all of the regs

167
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:09,728
there's a 45-day comment period again

168
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:12,399
the testing lab straggled they came out

169
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:15,038
today so it started out a 45-day comment

170
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:18,370
period that's a chance for you to weigh

171
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,418
in and help develop these regs so what

172
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,728
happens next

173
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:23,649
well we look at those comments and we

174
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:26,258
have to respond to those comments

175
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:28,598
anyway what so so we will have to

176
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,310
respond to your comment and it's

177
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:33,788
important to note that these are for

178
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:36,370
medical regulations but a lot of the

179
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:38,649
work and what we put into them it's a

180
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,949
lot of it's going to apply on adult use

181
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:44,620
side also a lot of things are not going

182
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:46,030
to change so then what are we going to

183
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,340
do what are we doing right now well

184
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:49,959
we're already well we wait for comments

185
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:51,939
we're already developing the adult youth

186
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,859
regulations because we have to because

187
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:55,778
our regulations have to be finalized by

188
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,500
the end of this year otherwise we can't

189
00:07:55,778 --> 00:08:01,360
issue licenses so we will be issuing our

190
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,668
adult regulations probably in the early

191
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,038
fall and we are going to do that through

192
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:08,560
what we have in a statute which is an

193
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:10,839
emergency rulemaking Authority meaning

194
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,538
when we notice them they pretty much go

195
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:16,209
into effect immediately and then all the

196
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:18,250
public comment is on the back end and we

197
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:21,459
have a certain time period we have to

198
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,408
get that done so a lot of why we want to

199
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,388
release the medical right now is because

200
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:27,610
we want to hear from you we want to take

201
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:29,949
you know you could give us comments that

202
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,070
I think will help us with the adult use

203
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:39,490
also another reason we'll probably wait

204
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:42,760
to the fall is why yeah he said harvest

205
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,669
not not really I was I guess I was we

206
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:48,240
were looking at that but

207
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:52,019
so but I think that's brilliant by the

208
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,110
way I'm going to start using that one so

209
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:57,029
we have two statutes right and so if you

210
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,240
want to be we want to have a medical

211
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:02,669
dispensary or you want to be a retailer

212
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,860
adult youth you have so far now we have

213
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:07,829
two statutes and the governor's budget

214
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:11,009
has said they want to try to align the

215
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:18,570
two statutes and why do you think we

216
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:21,689
want to do that true all sorts yeah all

217
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,480
those things but probably also but it's

218
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,880
a lot more efficient and productive for

219
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,340
and cheaper for all of us if we align

220
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,899
them together how confusing would it be

221
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,730
for you guys if I said well if you get a

222
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,289
medical dispensary you're under this set

223
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,000
of rules but if you get an adult use

224
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:38,490
you're going to be under this rule it

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
would be confusing for the state of he's

226
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,909
confusing for you

227
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,909
so what we're what we're seeing right

228
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:47,009
now is what's called the governor's

229
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:49,679
budget trailer bill how many have looked

230
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:52,230
at that yeah that's caught a lot of

231
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,789
attention so right now with the

232
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:58,009
governor's trailer bill they're trying

233
00:09:53,789 --> 00:10:01,259
to align the two models and so likely

234
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:04,319
that won't that is currently a bill it

235
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:06,929
has to be passed by two-thirds of the

236
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,300
legislature and we likely won't know

237
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:12,989
what the results are of that until late

238
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:15,359
June and then we will know what it will

239
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,759
look like so right now we're preparing

240
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,379
we're always like we're always preparing

241
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,769
for whatever we think might come down

242
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:24,000
the road and then we also have some

243
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:27,829
legislative bills out there how many do

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,830
we have out there right now for cannabis

245
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,720
so it's so Kenya it's like a moving

246
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:36,120
target around you know it's very it

247
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,769
makes my job pretty interesting and

248
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,590
exciting because every day something

249
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:44,039
changes so we're waiting to see what

250
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,750
happens on some of those 60 I didn't

251
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,899
think it was that many but anyway those

252
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,580
60 bills to see how it may further

253
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,730
change what our roles and

254
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,750
responsibilities are but what we're

255
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,340
trying to do with these regulations and

256
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,549
I think it's important for you to know I

257
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,500
mean we we do as California we want the

258
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:05,329
best model we want people to look at our

259
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,250
model and say gosh California got it

260
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,740
right and that's important to me and I

261
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,120
think it's important to all of you but

262
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,460
then we also want to make sure we're

263
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,769
protecting our the patience and the

264
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,470
consumer and the public and the

265
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,120
environment I mean but at the same time

266
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,730
we don't want our regulations that are

267
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,340
so onerous on a business that it's very

268
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,129
difficult to comply so it's trying to

269
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,070
strike that balance and I'll tell you

270
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:33,379
it's not easy to do that and and and so

271
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:36,230
you're going to hear me saying this we

272
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:38,179
truly want you to read these and comment

273
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,480
on them because I think it's important

274
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:43,519
you have to you need to weigh in and I

275
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,529
think that's where we get to I don't

276
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,529
think the Bureau food mag and public

277
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:50,569
health can alone come up with the best

278
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:53,360
model for California I think it takes

279
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,410
everybody in this room to help us with

280
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,100
that

281
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:59,449
so please

282
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,120
[Applause]

283
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,980
so everybody so that so now is everybody

284
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,830
going to go home and download the text

285
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,960
of our regs right so to help you with

286
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,820

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,710

statement of reasons by the way we all

298
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:46,009
because these are considered major

299
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:48,679
regulations we all had to do an economic

300

of you went to that there was a lot of

328
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,740
small group discussions a lot of

329
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:00,529
back-and-forth on regulation hearings

330
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,539
are there they're a different format we

331
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:04,819
we actually will just do an introduction

332
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:07,699
and it's just a chance for you to go up

333
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,379
to the mic and give us your comments we

334
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,240
have a court reporter there and they're

335
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:12,350
going to take they're going to take that

336
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,480
all down

337
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,220
and it'll be sort of it'll be different

338
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,200
for you guys because we're not supposed

339
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,990
to say anything back we're just going to

340
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,090
listen to you so I'm sure for some of me

341
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,590
some of us who like to talk that's going

342
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,200
to be very difficult not to say anything

343
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:29,990
back but it's just the format of how

344
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,570
they do regularly how we do regulations

345
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,899
hearing for this so we're going to be in

346
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:38,090
LA we're going to be in San Jose

347
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:41,319
Sacramento and Eureka and then Public

348
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,320
Health and Department of Food and

349
00:14:41,889 --> 00:15:08,960
Agriculture mendes challenge and I know

350
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:10,879
folks have said you know I just was out

351
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,470
of budget hearing and I know people

352
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,480
worried how are you going to make this

353
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:18,200
deadline how are you going to do it and

354
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,779
I think we've you know from day one that

355
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,270
was my calf they said this is this is

356
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,850
our deadline January 1st of 2018 the

357
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:28,370
only thing that proposition 64 did was

358
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,610
it just made it even more clear that we

359
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:35,450
had to issue licenses and so we have

360
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:39,279
learned to adapt and respond when things

361
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:42,080
change and I I really believe more time

362
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,269
isn't going to make that much of a

363
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,960
difference we need to start regulating

364
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:51,379
this process at this product at the

365
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,300
state level and and so is there going to

366
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:55,610
be some bumps along the road do you turn

367
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:58,490
on a switch on January 1st and license

368
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,990
everybody no you don't and so when

369
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,759
you're going to see in our regulations

370
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,560
and I would really like to hear what

371
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,720
people think of these especially those

372
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:07,959
of you who are in the industry and you

373
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,389
have your local permit we've looked at

374
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,910
having temporary permits for folks that

375
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:17,240
are in compliance to continue on we've

376
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:19,100
also looked continue operations and

377
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,930
giving you some grace period to get your

378
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,970
application in so we're not going to say

379
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:26,179
everybody has to be in day one we get we

380
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:29,180
gave like a six month period and we also

381
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:30,769
looked at testing because all canvas is

382
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:32,659
going to have to be tested but we knew

383
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:34,939
like if we start licensing people in the

384
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:37,149
first couple months likely the product

385
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,710
that you have in your dispensaries or

386
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:42,559
weirdest trip distributors or wherever

387
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:45,170
is not going to have tested so we put

388
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,539
some grace period to be able to test and

389
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:49,338
also get your packaging up and running

390
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,559
so I think those are things you need to

391
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:53,870
look at and really respond because I

392
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:55,969
think what's going to what I envision

393
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,500
January 1 is we're going to try to have

394
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,200
these transition and we're going to try

395
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,149
to transition as best we can to bring

396
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,170
folks into the regulated market because

397
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:07,429
I think it it's one of those things that

398
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,350
we need to work to everything's not

399
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:11,929
going to be perfect at once but one of

400
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:14,750
the things I say is maybe something

401
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:16,910
doesn't work us as the state has to be

402
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,400
ready to respond when things don't work

403
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,769
and we have to respond quickly because

404
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,990
this is an industry that evolves very

405
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:27,500
quick thing I'll tell you it is evolved

406
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,299
very quickly and so my commitment is is

407
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,980
when we do get you up and running we

408
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,839
have those regulations in place if

409
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,370
things aren't working then we have to be

410
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:37,159
able to respond and change those things

411
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:38,839
anyway it's an absolute pleasure to be

412
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,000
here I won't take any more time and

413
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:44,139
anxious to listen to your questions and

414
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,140
answer them thank you very much

415
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:57,009
what areas of the regulations are you

416
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:59,500
struggling with well I'll tell you uh I

417
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:03,069
think I said earlier the lab regulations

418
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:06,569
were that was a big heavy lift because I

419
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:08,950
know that as you see in both a um a and

420
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:11,769
medical campus regulation and Safety Act

421
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,558
that is a can you hear me okay that was

422
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:17,798
a big thing about the cannabis test and

423
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:20,289
making sure we're testing for pesticides

424
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:21,819
and having those levels of pesticide so

425
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:26,409
that was probably the biggest challenge

426
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:29,470
for us the other one was just I think

427
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:32,710
some of these things for me some of it I

428
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:35,140
was used to doing regulations at my

429
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,819
previous agency but actually coming up

430
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,919
with what we were going to require on an

431
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:40,539
application sometimes can be challenging

432
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,160
and what we are going to require who's

433
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:46,000
going to be an ownership who qualifies

434
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,950
as owners if you look at that was a big

435
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,079
question at a pre regulation is who

436
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,360
who's going to have to be background and

437
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,539
fingerprint and when you see our

438
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:58,449
regulations you'll see we have really

439
00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:01,539
taken the approach of going aligning it

440
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:05,380
with Proposition 64 so we're looking at

441
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:07,389
a 20% aggregate ownership and what not

442
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,370
and not having spouses having to be

443
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,590
background but having to be disclosed so

444
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:13,599
that was a lot of back-and-forth because

445
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:15,609
we had different sides more people

446
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,859
wanted you know more you know more

447
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:20,168
background checks employee background

448
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:22,119
checks and then we looked at you know

449
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:23,530
there was two different sides so yeah

450
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,689
there's no employee background checks

451
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:29,500
either so we really try to strike that

452
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,730
balance thank you Laurie

453
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:35,169
last question before I introduce the

454
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:39,039
next speaker people in the business I

455
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:41,049
hear a lot of questions about Bank how

456
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:45,009
do we how do we Bank how these credit

457
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:46,839
cards is there it's probably a tad out

458
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:48,940
of your purview but I'm curious because

459
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:50,859
everything marijuana right now is sort

460
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,558
of under your purview comments on

461
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:57,099
banking yeah thank you that's a really

462
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:58,250
tough issue if any of you watched our

463
00:19:57,099 --> 00:20:01,669
budget hearing

464
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:04,279
today that was a big question how are

465
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:06,289
all these state agencies going to accept

466
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:10,009
cash especially if we can't bank

467
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:13,490
cannabis and so a lot of time was spent

468
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:16,430
on talking about that you know Board of

469
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,809
Equalization the bureau everybody that

470
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:22,430
you're going to have to be bringing cash

471
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:24,259
and and I think you know we're preparing

472
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,759
for that our facilities are preparing

473
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:27,589
that to make sure we have a facility

474
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,910
that can take cash but is that really

475
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:36,619
the answer probably not the best answer

476
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:38,810
right now we're working with John Chung

477
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:41,179
our state treasurer has a banking

478
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,639
cannabis working group that I serve as a

479
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:46,130
member on that committee and he we are

480
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,130
trying to look for solutions if there is

481
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:51,260
there a solution for California and

482
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:54,110
looking to having a coordinated approach

483
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:56,839
with all the different agencies and the

484
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:58,609
local agencies and we also have the can

485
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,730
of it you know the Association the

486
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:02,869
cannabis associations on this board

487
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,960
likely we are not going to find a

488
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:09,429
solution by January 1st of 2018 I think

489
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,049
there still needs to be some federal

490
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,360
there's there has to be something having

491
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:17,779
at the federal level I think to make it

492
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:21,199
easier for people to bank cannabis in

493
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:22,549
the meantime we are going to all of us

494
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,100
are going to have an online system that

495
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:27,769
can take credit cards that can take

496
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:30,709
debit cards we're going to just take all

497
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:32,089
forms of whatever you're going to come

498
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,700
to us that we haven't figured out

499
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:36,829
Bitcoin yet but everything else what

500
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,779
we'll pay basically somebody asked me to

501
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:43,819
do that so I I think that's ongoing and

502
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:46,009
that's not the bureau that's that's

503
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:48,919
everybody that's that's the industry

504
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:51,379
that the state agencies the federal

505
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,840
government and I think you know at some

506
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,330
point we all need to find this solution

507
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,849
together and I think California coming

508
00:21:56,329 --> 00:22:01,549
on board with the legalized market I'm

509
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:03,619
hoping there will be some movement on

510
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:05,210
that and that's someday you know because

511
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:07,639
I'll tell you from from my point of view

512
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,950
I know you guys are dealing with cash is

513
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,040
the safety issue the public safety

514
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,180
issues but even

515
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,549
when you look at here we're going to

516
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,320
regulate this highly regulated product

517
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:19,649
that we're going to regulate you and yes

518
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,419
a lot of regulations and then you're

519
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,180
going to still be using cash as a

520
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:26,100
regulator you following the cash and

521
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,410
figuring out that that you it's very

522
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:32,399
difficult as a regulator to do that and

523
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:34,340
so it you know I think for all of us we

524
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,870
all want to find a solution to this

525
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:39,359
thank you I will tell you there's some

526
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:41,489
people in this room from the grow

527
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,079
facility invests in supposed to gross

528
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,079
when it's all really going thirty

529
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:49,079
million a year and state tax are

530
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,699
thirteen percent you can imagine it's

531
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,799
like Scarface or something with big

532
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,519
barrels of cash so it's a pretty scary

533
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,519
proposition

534
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,809
hi my name is Jackie McGowan and I have

535
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:06,339
a question for Lori Ajax not also like

536
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:07,928
to say thank you all for all the hard

537
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:11,019
work that you're doing in many different

538
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:15,240
aspects of this industry I tracks local

539
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:17,650
regulations specifically the medical but

540
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,980
my question is regarding the

541
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:22,990
recreational adult youth and I've only

542
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,410
seen two cities talk about allowing

543
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:28,450
adult use dispensaries and if they were

544
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,970
to open their doors on January 1st of

545
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,350
2018 nobody's talking about the fact

546
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,829
that there is not one single

547
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:38,230
municipality in the entire state that is

548
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:40,000
even thinking about allowing adult

549
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,150
youths cultivation manufacturing

550
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,490
distribution testing so on January 1st

551
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,830
if you're ready to accept applications

552
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:50,980
for adult use dispensaries like the

553
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:53,710
voters have voted for where's the supply

554
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,839
chain that have come from so I think a

555
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,490
lot of you know a lot of these

556
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,859
jurisdictions I think what was said

557
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,240
earlier I think they are waiting to see

558
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:03,129
what the state is doing with their

559
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,529
regulations on both medical and adult

560
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:08,140
use a lot of them just don't have the

561
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:10,119
resources and so you know it's it's

562
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,919
usually the state rolling out the

563
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:13,928
regulations and the city and counties

564
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,270
following in this case they've been

565
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:19,330
doing it a lot longer than the state so

566
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:22,150
we have we do a lot of outreach with the

567
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:23,949
local municipalities it's not our job to

568
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,200
convince them one way or the other but

569
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,870
it's important to explain to them where

570
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,940
we're at on our regulation product in

571
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:33,879
our process you know when they're coming

572
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,200
out and we're we're thinking there'll be

573
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,799
a lot more movement but you're

574
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,009
absolutely right even in adult use we

575
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:45,009
can't issue a license if it violates

576
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:48,490
local ordinance or regulation so it is

577
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:51,190
local control which puts is challenging

578
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:53,349
for us at the state because we do have

579
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,870
to make sure that we're not violating

580
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:57,159
anything by issuing that license but one

581
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:00,489
of the things we're looking at too and

582
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,380
just to give you an idea on it's not

583
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,210
just the supply chain its the supply

584
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,740
chain across the whole state we worry

585
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,519
about whether there's enough testing

586
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:12,880
labs to test the product right and so we

587
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,589
are trying to get to a point where RIT

588
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,530
some would be able to start taking

589
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:20,949
applications sooner than January 1st

590
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:24,220
2018 and so we are on we are trying to

591
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,539
fast-track that and I you know I'm not

592
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,009
going to sit here and say we're going to

593
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:30,909
it's going to be ready because a lot

594
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:33,190
determines with RIT right now what we're

595
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,990
working on we are working we I have

596
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,930
staff that that's what they spend all

597
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:40,150
day long as configuring our system but

598
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:42,759
if we could take applications ahead of

599
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:46,720
time it gives us an idea of where people

600
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:48,789
are applying what how many license types

601
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,860
are out there and would really give us a

602
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:52,269
lot of runway for January 1st to give us

603
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:55,329
it would give everybody a lot more

604
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:57,609
information my name is Tamara Krusty

605
00:25:55,329 --> 00:26:00,970
onion I'm a small edible manufacturer

606
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:02,259
and my question is to lori Ajax but

607
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,759
first I'd like to thank everyone in the

608
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:06,849
panel for coming tonight and for Susan

609
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,799
for helping put this event together as

610
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:12,159
someone that was in the pre regulatory

611
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,319
meetings that the bureau held I'm not

612
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,230
very optimistic about the viewer being

613
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:20,230
open to feedback from the public to

614
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:22,420
these regulations because most of the

615
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:25,000
comments that were brought up in our pre

616
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:27,700
regulatory discussions were I think the

617
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,440
exact opposite of it is in distress I'll

618
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:34,330
take for one example the milligram limit

619
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,330
100 milligram per package I know that

620
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:39,189
there are a lot of patients that you

621
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:41,409
know some of them are vets that have

622
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,170
PTSD and require higher dosages for

623
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:45,759
example 2 or 300 milligrams now if you

624
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,950
break it down and you think that a 10

625
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,279
milligram dose is maybe the equivalent

626
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:54,430
of 75 calories that means that in 100

627
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:58,000
milligram pack there's 750 calories and

628
00:26:54,430 --> 00:27:01,810
in their dose there would be 20 250

629
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,809
calories that's above the allocated

630
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:07,599
calorie consumption per day how are they

631
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:10,750
supposed to take their medicine if

632
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:13,109
they're forced to eat so much calories

633
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,519
the bureau didn't develop the

634
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:17,019
manufacturing regulations that's from

635
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,029
the Department of Public Health but they

636
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:23,049
were with us that our pre regulation

637
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:24,759
hearings so I can't comment on on

638
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:28,059
on how they you know because they have a

639
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:31,029
lot of folks there research scientists

640
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:34,059
that came up with those regulations but

641
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:35,950
I will tell you for all three of us we

642
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:38,019
have continued to say these are proposed

643
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,269
regulations they're draft regulations

644
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:41,910
exactly what you're saying right now is

645
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:45,009
what I would hope that you would

646
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,420
communicate that to my colleagues at the

647
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:48,369
Department of Public Health because I'm

648
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,220
going to tell you they are very open to

649
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:55,269
comment but you have to also understand

650
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:57,279
there also when you went there when we

651
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:59,589
look at lessons learned from other

652
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,480
states or looking at some of what has

653
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:04,359
happened with the edibles in Colorado

654
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,920
and whatnot so I think you know maybe in

655
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:08,529
the beginning they came out a little

656
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,590
conservative but I think they're open to

657
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:14,349
just two other things especially if you

658
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:17,740
can justify the reason why it should be

659
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:19,480
higher my name is Pamela Epstein and I

660
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,890
am an attorney and a consultant in the

661
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,980
space I've had the pleasure of working

662
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:26,710
with operators and both with cities

663
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,569
drafting mtrs a compliant ordinances and

664
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,620
regulations and so as I'm reading

665
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:32,079
through the regulations

666
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:34,299
I have operator to our delivery service

667
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,279
providers who are able to go and get

668
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:38,589
medication to the patients that need it

669
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:40,450
that can't come into a dispensary I have

670
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:43,329
cities that look at dispenser or

671
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,480
delivery as an option that's easier for

672
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:47,679
them more palatable than a storefront

673
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,349
unfortunately in the trailer bill and in

674
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,600
the regs there is no outlet for them so

675
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:56,469
they need to comment and whereas I

676
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:58,809
appreciate the Department of Public

677
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:02,049
Health giving and in a pee license so

678
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:04,179
that we can have a more robust situation

679
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:05,710
in that realm we don't have that same

680
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,029
thing for the delivery so Lori my

681
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,559
question is for you but thank you

682
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:11,170
everybody for the work you do in the

683
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,589
space I think there's some bills that

684
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:17,410
are dressing the non front dispensaries

685
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:19,629
but even so even in a um a there's

686
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:22,509
nothing in there that says you have to

687
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:24,910
advertise that your storefront

688
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:26,859
dispensary I think when you look at our

689
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:30,759
regs as we go forward with adult use

690
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:33,009
it's for delivery it has to be delivery

691
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:35,680
it has to be dispensary employees so it

692
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:36,519
can't be a third party delivery but

693
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,879
there

694
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:41,950
or you just need to have a location and

695
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:44,558
comply with our definition of premises

696
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:46,569
which is separate and distinct whether

697
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:47,558
or not you advertise I think there's

698
00:29:46,569 --> 00:29:49,118
going to be different cities and

699
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:52,088
counties that may not want you to

700
00:29:49,118 --> 00:29:54,699
advertise so I think when we go forward

701
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:57,898
with our adult use regulations I I think

702
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,899
some of that may be resolved

703
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:06,090
