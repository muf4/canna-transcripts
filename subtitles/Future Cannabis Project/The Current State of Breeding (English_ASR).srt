1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,500
give some love to someone who's genetic

2
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,750
Tsar like blowing you away honest it's

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,699
been a genetic that was an 11-year hunt

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,740
for me I thought it was in seed form

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:19,198
turns out it was a clone only form and

6
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:22,259
it was from southern Ohio it was a

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,090
strain called lemon G a lot of our

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,429
breeders are currently using it it's a

9
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,320
strain that's predominantly or I'm sorry

10
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,778
a cut that's predominantly saturated the

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,780
market but the terpene profile to me is

12
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,820
timeless and the original formation of

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,739
that was totally by chance it was a bag

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,450
seed from what I'm told I actually had

15
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,399
contact with the original breeders over

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,870
the years the original breeders I can't

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,939
necessarily tell you their names just

18
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,280
based on the fact that they're still in

19
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:50,699
a state where technically they could be

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,439
obtained for what they did however I can

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,910
tell you this they are some the most

22
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,089
fantastic people I've ever had the

23
00:00:53,909 --> 00:01:00,419
graces of coming into contact with very

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,280
very much community type people that was

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,079
a seed strain where it was a total

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,780
random crack they got everything from a

27
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,908
waxy overtone of the lemon terpene down

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,310
where they crossing it was a lemon

29
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,780
genome ir i'm sorry it was a skunk

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,609
genome I believe they said somewhere in

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,969
there was the original G 13 but to be

32
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,680
totally direct I'm not 100% the

33
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,298
statement I had only heard them actually

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,880
referenced the original parent genetics

35
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,490
twice in my lifetime after countless

36
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,289
sit-downs so it's something that I know

37
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,359
they hold very dear and I'm kind of glad

38
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,890
I don't know if that's the case but

39
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,090
ultimately I do know that the skunk

40
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,820
genetic is in there and that's

41
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,030
attributing to the terpene profile from

42
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,398
what they they were gathering that lemon

43
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,939
terpene ended up being everything from

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,879
acrylic wax to full-on just straight-up

45
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,859
hind saw and the one that I came into

46
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,618
contact with actually nine years ago

47
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,899
well no it would be 11 now I've had the

48
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:01,920
strange for two years so that would have

49
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,960
been a nine year hunt that one was the

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,460
pine Sophie no that was one that didn't

51
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,519
sell and like Rick was saying earlier

52
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,598
when we were talking about sometimes the

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,489
terpenes can be a double-edged sword

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,289
because all of a sudden it's a great

55
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,289
after-dinner

56
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:17,090
strean but not necessarily a every

57
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:18,938
moment strain and that becomes a very

58
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,468
big issue when you're producing

59
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:23,959
especially on a commercial scale because

60
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:26,358
sell ability is always number one on

61
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,489
that based on well I shouldn't say

62
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:30,319
number one because ideally the health of

63
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:32,299
the plan and the people consuming it is

64
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,729
the number one let's say that be the

65
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:35,780
number two so ultimately it's one of

66
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,280
those things where you've got to pay

67
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,688
attention to your market you've got to

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,789
adjust which is one of the reasons why

69
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:42,530
we're seeing the Mac takeover what

70
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:44,179
worries me about this is yes it's a

71
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,579
great strain and yes the cookies are

72
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,409
great but when the cookies over saturate

73
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:50,659
the market and the glue over saturates

74
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:52,878
the market we start to see crossbreeding

75
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:54,408
reliant on these strains this is where

76
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,668
it becomes a very big danger for us

77
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:58,219
because now we're starting to

78
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:00,379
single-channel all of our genetics into

79
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,969
another genetic what this does is it

80
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:04,370
actually lop sides the market and

81
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:06,438
creates a dog breeding issue if you will

82
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,840
where all of a sudden inbreeding is

83
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:10,370
almost a direct result and there's no

84
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,680
around it because of the way that the

85
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,419
prior genetics have been bred and that's

86
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,060
going to destabilize over time and

87
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:19,549
create issues or genetic mutations which

88
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,469
could be good could be bad I also

89
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:23,599
believe that that's part possibly why

90
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:26,269
we've seen such a dramatic THC increase

91
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,098
because in the last twenty years all the

92
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,139
breeding we've been doing has been

93
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:32,388
crossing these genomes so aggressively

94
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:34,159
that we see stresses that we never would

95
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:35,419
have seen in a naturalised environment

96
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,030
these are plants that would have never

97
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:39,620
met in nature when that happens we're

98
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,209
stretching the genetic rubberband and

99
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,609
creating a lot of genetic variability

100
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,739
that don't necessarily mean everything

101
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:48,019
we want and a lot of destabilization

102
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:51,169
comes from these processes which is also

103
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:53,750
part of the cause of today's multi Fino

104
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:55,519
generation we'll call it where it's okay

105
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,009
if I have 30 different phenols

106
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,379
come out of a seed pack it's a sellable

107
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:01,759
seed really in the old market that would

108
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:03,018
have not have been sellable in fact

109
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,969
that's one of the reasons why the

110
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,039
Amsterdam market was so closed off

111
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:09,438
because those readers had processes to

112
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,539
maintain quality and we don't see those

113
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,848
practices being transformed today in

114
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:15,769
very many seed banks they'll be at great

115
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:18,199
genetics coming out of those seed banks

116
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:20,269
so as far as quality of genetics that's

117
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,629
not necessarily the equation here what's

118
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,360
the equation is the lawn

119
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:26,430
the long game of having that genetic or

120
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,550
some traits of that genetic not be

121
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,639
mutated down the line by a incestual

122
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,310
pattern of breeding which is almost in

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,560
some cases and in some markets

124
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:40,370
impossible to escape so imagine the old

125
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,139
days you know when we had a lot more

126
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,970
quarantine going on to our groups and

127
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,469
collectives we maybe had three friends

128
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,270
that we got introduced into the same

129
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,460
thing we were doing and then out of

130
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:53,519
those three friends maybe we have six

131
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:56,099
seven genetics that's our breeding pile

132
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,599
that's a very shallow breeding pool and

133
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,879
that's where a lot of these hybridized

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,820
things came out of and you know as

135
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:05,939
America expanded its seed collaborations

136
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:09,240
and became a seed creating populous

137
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,850
which used to only belong over in you

138
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,120
know Europe at the time and maybe down

139
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,040
south in South America we we literally

140
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,360
skipped some processes you know we

141
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,250
didn't have a teacher so they were

142
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,560
accidents that were made accidentally

143
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,589
which is should be harmless but they're

144
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,089
not to the endgame so you know it's one

145
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:28,949
of those things where a miss education

146
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:31,199
and a little bit too much fun too early

147
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:32,399
is gonna cause us future problems in

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,189
this industry if we don't pay attention

149
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,169
to them currently so when I say things

150
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:39,360
like you know that the max grade or the

151
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,830
cookies are great but what I really mean

152
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,780
by that are they fantastic the people

153
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:44,519
working with them are working with them

154
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,409
for a very specific reason and that's

155
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,449
awesome and I hope that they get what

156
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,950
they need out of it but if we're over

157
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,409
breeding these strains we're

158
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,870
destabilizing our future availability to

159
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,780
further creation of terpene profiles

160
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,360
chirping mixes the availability to

161
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,939
having a good THC volume with heavy

162
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,110
terpenes or you know just the anomalies

163
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:06,540
that we're not currently seeing

164
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,400
prevalently on today's market and really

165
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,970
prevalently ever because we've been

166
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,859
continually developing this crop only

167
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:17,070
aggressively let's say in the last 20

168
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,930
years notably that's really different

169
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,519
when we talk about agriculture we're

170
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,590
talking about things that have been kind

171
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,849
of corn was something that had over 200

172
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,369
years of development

173
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,930
so you know it's a big change in pace

174
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,819
and we still have time to fix these

175
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,060
problems that we're now realizing have

176
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:35,969
been caused by shallow breed chello gene

177
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,129
pools so you know when we see

178
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,200
destabilizing genetics we see pollen

179
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:41,699
late-stage like basically week seven

180
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,920
week eight popping out single little

181
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,509
bananas these are all things that say we

182
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,520
shouldn't went further generations or

183
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,560
further genomes out before back breeding

184
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,359
back in and that's really where the

185
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,439
stabilization comes into play and one of

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,080
the reasons we're not seeing it in

187
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,879
today's game that takes years because

188
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,649
we're gonna do that maybe three four or

189
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,649
five times but in order to do that

190
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:03,689
that's four times a set oh then it has

191
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:05,699
to mix with its parents for generations

192
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,069
back then we go back and do the same

193
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:11,009
line of sequence over and over again and

194
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:13,230
that's how you get to the f-16s f-18s F

195
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:16,579
20s and when you get there you narrow

196
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:19,350
down your fee nose that way and so what

197
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:21,060
basically Rick was talking about with

198
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,200
the parents breeding to create those

199
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,129
seeds is once you have that that is your

200
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,519
that's your Mona Lisa

201
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:31,500
and so what his techniques allow and why

202
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,349
I have such a respect for for Rick and

203
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,779
Brothers Grimm is they do a great deal

204
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,610
of work just safe lining their painting

205
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,009
they don't store their paintings in

206
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,960
direct sunlight they literally sit there

207
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:44,819
and have them behind covered glass

208
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,829
making sure that they're protected so

209
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,449
when somebody wants to enjoy them they

210
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:51,329
enjoy what they are expecting they're

211
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,490
enjoying what they remember for instance

212
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:55,199
and this is not a slam on nirvana I've

213
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,350
gotten great great genetics out of

214
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,069
nirvana back in the early days we worked

215
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:04,200
with nirvana on a couple of strands ice

216
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:05,069
we worked with them on mystic blue and

217
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,129
papaya

218
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:10,110
great strains we all amongst others

219
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:13,079
Medusa Snow White all kinds of stuff

220
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:18,480
from them but what I noticed was after

221
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:21,359
the EU formed and kind of took over and

222
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,700
altered our industry over in Europe we

223
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,430
ended up having genetic issues with

224
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,870
retaining what we remember now some of

225
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,750
the turkeys were still there but the

226
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,389
flower formation was completely

227
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,820
prynt I had a papaya that looked like it

228
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:36,439
could have been wheat from the way it

229
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,300
grew I mean it would it would have

230
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,550
produced crazy amounts due to that

231
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:43,279
almost I'd have to say a thousand heads

232
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:45,139
it had but they were all no bigger than

233
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,850
wheat so you know it was kind of a

234
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:49,129
really weird flower formation papaya is

235
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,470
known for big chunky flowers had the

236
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:53,029
smell so somewhere along the line

237
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,200
destabilization of these genetics

238
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,759
occurred because now these are

239
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,920
phenotypes that we never used to see in

240
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,870
the early days these are all obscurities

241
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,019
and they're from the same genetic

242
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,789
profiles that's why were quite rick was

243
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,679
talking about with going back and having

244
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:09,500
these parents on safeline is a big deal

245
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:11,569
now over in europe with the EU shifts

246
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,440
and the raids that happen in switzerland

247
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,920
and austria we started to see that

248
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,020
destabilization because by the

249
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,659
government and not necessarily something

250
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:22,669
these breeders did so to hold it against

251
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:24,259
them is absolutely asinine because they

252
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:25,969
were just trying to make sure that they

253
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:28,340
were staying in line with what they had

254
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,230
now granted they just got crippled by

255
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,030
their own people and pushed back super

256
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,590
far in their genetic lines and had to go

257
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,569
back and crack seats for mothers again

258
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,129
and like Rick was saying if you want to

259
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,060
change your line up and get variants

260
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:40,429
that's how you do it

261
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:41,809
if you want to go for consistency you

262
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:43,669
need your mother and your father to

263
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:45,529
rebreathe reburied otherwise your seed

264
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:47,990
batches will vary from time to time and

265
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:50,029
yes aging can be an issue but that's

266
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,519
where proper usage of boron would during

267
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:54,230
these processes and phosphates end up

268
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,600
allowing for these seeds to be produced

269
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,060
with all the micro macro minerals and

270
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,710
elements that's needed for the

271
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:03,579
protection of this genetic now I

272
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,720
reference boron mainly because it's main

273
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,210
thing in a plant system is to create

274
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,190
plasma which is basically the cushion

275
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,170
inside the cell for all the material to

276
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,240
stay from clacking and getting damaged

277
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:15,709
so that's one of the reasons why boron

278
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,659
is actually very important in the seed

279
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,610
industry as well as phosphates because

280
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:22,009
that increases vigor to the plant and

281
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:26,539
generally keeps the root base healthy as

282
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:28,970
well so there are ways to kind of almost

283
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:30,829
have better and worse seed batches based

284
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,930
on your chemistry's in your grow room as

285
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,700
well so there's a lot of variables that

286
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:35,370
we don't necessarily take into account

287
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,770
when looking

288
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,350
whose consistent and who's not and

289
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,759
that's a big deal because we get one

290
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,710
chance to draw an opinion off of most

291
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,419
seed packs very few of us are like

292
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:49,019
myself and a few other breeders I know

293
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:51,299
that go out and buy 1015 packs of you

294
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,799
know regular seeds to go phyno hunting

295
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:54,750
through get a feel for the genetic and

296
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,120
try and pull something that we can make

297
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,980
a market with and that's really where

298
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,870
feminization loses its foothold

299
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,519
because feminization yes we'll give you

300
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,710
what the breeder wants but you're going

301
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,960
to ultimately end up with the same fee

302
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,780
know that the dude 200 miles away has

303
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,450
now in your markets mesh it's gonna

304
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:14,939
interfere so the whole idea with Renko

305
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,790
seeds or regular seeds as I am sorry for

306
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,870
callin breakouts regular regular seeds

307
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:24,089
is the idea of actually getting a true

308
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,429
unrepeatable phenotype because like Rick

309
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,259
was saying there's very fine subtleties

310
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:29,939
that will change along the way and

311
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,370
that's really what your corners stoning

312
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,170
on you want that change in the flavor

313
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,970
you want that change to the actual

314
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:38,129
physical growth at the plant maybe it's

315
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,399
a denser plant than the others have we

316
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:42,480
look at the gorilla glue an original

317
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,009
conception of the gorilla glue when it

318
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,899
came out there were two actual gorilla

319
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:47,429
coup cuts from my knowledge of what it

320
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,319
was in the first one out with a lower

321
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:51,209
yielding strain that was identical to

322
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,940
the higher yielding strain in almost

323
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,460
every way and now this could be a little

324
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,410
bit of folklore mind you so there's no I

325
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,730
don't have this I haven't spoken with

326
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:03,110
the breeder and had him say yes this

327
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:06,830
happened okay so but the idea is this

328
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:09,930
they sold out on the lower yield and

329
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,389
Aidid that in the public market and from

330
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:14,309
what I remember they handed it out which

331
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:15,870
at that point you're thankful to have an

332
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:17,609
awesome genetic right I mean it's

333
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,429
gorilla glue is freakin great regardless

334
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,680
of how much he deals well later on there

335
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:25,169
was some issue that ended up happening

336
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,449
and I guess they lost ability to have

337
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:30,269
access to that strain and there was kind

338
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:33,240
of the all of a sudden lift in the

339
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:36,539
volumes we saw from gorilla glue now is

340
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,299
that substantially due to genetic

341
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,500
drifting off of cuttings could be or it

342
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,699
could be that they actually came out

343
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,740
with the two different cuts which is

344
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,960
something that can happen and that's

345
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,180
just kind of an example of genetics

346
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,730
it's literally like looking like your

347
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,679
brother but being two inches taller and

348
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,920
that's exactly kind of the process and

349
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,899
why it's important to have your own is

350
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:59,669
out of a pack of a thousand we say there

351
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,409
will be a couple of superstars you're

352
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:03,539
looking at the superstar to really build

353
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:05,610
your facility with maintaining your

354
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:08,009
market if you want to go national or

355
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,019
even want to go and take over a state or

356
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:12,028
even a portion of a state or even a

357
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,829
portion of your city with what you're

358
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:17,490
doing you've got to have something

359
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:19,020
nobody else has otherwise the next guy

360
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,549
can come down knock ten bucks off your

361
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,500
price and he's gonna take your market

362
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,389
and walk with it that's where we see

363
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,759
this drastic destabilization of the

364
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:28,139
pound - and that's where I get worried

365
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,689
because like we were talking earlier

366
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,819
with all the genomes kind of Bible

367
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,230
necking we're starting to see price per

368
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,910
pound drop because everybody's going to

369
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,379
have this or everybody's going to have

370
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:40,649
that and that's going to eventually

371
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:42,509
affect the entire market and so not only

372
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:44,519
are we shooting ourselves in the foot in

373
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:47,000
the future of having variabilities to

374
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,289
our genomes but we're also creating a

375
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,389
decomposition to our market at a much

376
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:53,519
faster rate by centering around just a

377
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:55,679
couple of these genomes and not truly

378
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,720
having that kind of what's next field

379
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,129
and it's one of my favorite parts about

380
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,170
this is not knowing what's around the

381
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,970
corner you get a seed pack from a

382
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:04,528
regular bag that you had from years and

383
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,209
years ago and you get a sativa that

384
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:08,458
blows your socks off because it was done

385
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:10,708
inside not out or it wasn't brought over

386
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:13,769
in a tire and sprayed with ammonia now

387
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:15,179
granted that's extremely rare but if

388
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,069
you're not going on looking for these

389
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:20,278
genomes you're never gonna find the new

390
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:22,860
genetic crunch the thing that everybody

391
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,720
wants and we all have this essence of

392
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,820
wanting to be the creator of our own art

393
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,399
and that's really what it comes down to

394
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,140
when we want a canvas do we want

395
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,819
something that consistently has a road

396
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:35,039
painted in it before we get there such

397
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,440
as having a genetic that everybody else

398
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,179
has in that genome and all of a sudden

399
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,650
I'm stuck painting Lansing's what

400
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:43,139
happens if I want to paint an ocean

401
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:46,110
scene and have a big wave in an iceberg

402
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:48,028
I got a a road sitting right in middle

403
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,220
it's like somehow there's a road there

404
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:50,509
folks but you know and that's kind of

405
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,639
what

406
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:55,159
doing with the genomes and it's it's

407
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,720
exciting though you know I speak on it

408
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,000
as almost a negative thing but it's the

409
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,070
exciting parts because you never get the

410
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,750
bruises until you fall you never get the

411
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,090
bumps on the nose to tell you not to run

412
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,370
down the hall until you face the wall

413
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,230
okay so you know these are our wake-up

414
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,940
calls these are our moments to see and

415
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,430
and we've hit that point in the creation

416
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,630
of these genetic availabilities to

417
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,759
really start to see the flaws and

418
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:18,740
follies and also the Grands and the

419
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:21,679
glories and know what's what now to

420
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,720
produce and proceed with it thankfully

421
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,789
with today's Internet age we have access

422
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,580
to more books than we could speak up

423
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:30,980
back in the day when we first started it

424
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,389
was a situation where you go to Barnes

425
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,860
and Nobles and have your friend buy your

426
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,569
book and then he'd meet you at a gas

427
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,730
station ten miles from your house I mean

428
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,430
it was absurd but it was what we had to

429
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,379
do to feel safe and nowadays you just

430
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:43,579
hop on the internet Google up plant the

431
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,169
fish and seeds and you'll find out

432
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,090
what's going wrong in your garden I mean

433
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:51,559
it's it's one of the greatest

434
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:53,269
turnarounds this industry I would have

435
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,799
let me say this it's a great turnaround

436
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,539
that I would have never seen coming in

437
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,870
my lifetime especially growing up in

438
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:01,519
this industry at the ages of 15 16

439
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,560
figuring it out and having the old ways

440
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,319
kind of translate into the new

441
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:08,779
availability and what I see from that is

442
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,400
a lot of carelessness but from this

443
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:13,579
carelessness can come a lot of greatness

444
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,709
comes a lot of wake-up calls it also can

445
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,300
cause a lot of problems but just like

446
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,340
anything else anybody who's grown a

447
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:22,699
business or a grown genetics or grown

448
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,259
anything it all comes with problems so

449
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,390
these problems that I speak of are not

450
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:28,129
necessarily truly negative in fact

451
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:30,259
they're absolutely positive to this

452
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:32,899
industry because without these lessons

453
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:34,220
we ultimately might find ourselves lost

454
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:36,379
in the middle of the woods instead of

455
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,360
still in view of the path and that's a

456
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:42,230
big deal when we're able to create

457
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,690
health in my garden I'm able to do this

458
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,779
I'm able to maintain and care for others

459
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:50,110
and myself and and really focus on the

460
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:51,129
health and quality of the material

461
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,750
and that's some we're starting to see

462
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:55,328
with commercialization with mass

463
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,278
spectrometry and it's creating a safer

464
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:59,019
product for all of us and ultimately

465
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,149
when you have the genetics the next

466
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:03,429
thing is what was that genetics grown

467
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:06,459
with I mean we look at this market we

468
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:07,990
say old foods food well no it's not are

469
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,699
you gonna feed your kid noodles everyday

470
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,519
and just oatmeal and see him develop

471
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,170
into a great fantastic multi-dimensional

472
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,670
human being no he's gonna lose his

473
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,650
eyesight he may not have brain

474
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,939
development these are the same things

475
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,370
that we don't know we're doing to these

476
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,860
plants yet by not knowing how to feed it

477
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:25,178
properly we aren't necessarily giving

478
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,918
these plants everything they can to

479
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:28,750
create their best and we don't know it

480
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:29,980
and that's what we're realizing in the

481
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,970
hemp industry as well

482
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,860
and a lot of these farmers are

483
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,650
intentionally starving these crops to

484
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:37,029
not permit to making THC so the

485
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,919
understanding of food in the cannabis

486
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:41,379
plant is very much in its infancy in

487
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,090
this industry just based on the

488
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,070
understanding of the public it's not in

489
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:46,599
its infancy as far as its development

490
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:48,490
and that's where a really interesting

491
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,949
correlation comes in so it's almost like

492
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,569
handing a six-year-old a cellphone they

493
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,919
may not know what they have but they

494
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:56,019
know they like it and they know that it

495
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,330
does well and that's we're focusing on

496
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:59,829
all aspects of your grow comes into play

497
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:01,359
I mean you talk to a gardener about

498
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:03,339
what's their water source and all of a

499
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,428
sudden oh I do well are you treating

500
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:08,859
your water no why are you not treating

501
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:10,660
your water why are you not setting a

502
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:12,909
zero variability in the biggest variable

503
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,440
area of your room I mean your

504
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,660
chemistry's your genetics

505
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,419
none of that may work right with the

506
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:22,090
wrong water so it's very important to

507
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:24,009
start with at the full picture you start

508
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:26,619
at the base and work your way up but

509
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:28,419
every single volume of this cultivation

510
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:31,089
in the state of being is important and

511
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:32,470
just as important and so it's

512
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,909
interesting because you may say Oh

513
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,429
nutrients are more important or

514
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:39,100
Lighting's more important or mediums

515
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,480
just as important but the reality is is

516
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:43,000
it's all important because it's a

517
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,798
symbiotic nature in which they mesh

518
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,289
that's going to create that end product

519
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,210
you can use a nutritional line and see a

520
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:51,339
pound and a half reduction perlite or

521
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,079
you can use that same nutritional line

522
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,148
properly and

523
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:56,439
three pounds of light and there's a

524
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:57,939
variance we don't know as gardeners

525
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,100
because it's it's a misunderstanding

526
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,288
we've been working with GMO crops on the

527
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:04,658
AG fields for too long and so when we

528
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:06,489
associate farming we ultimately think a

529
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:08,320
big AG and then we think of genetic

530
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:10,090
development and not realizing that those

531
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,418
implementations have not been applied to

532
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:15,398
this area yet and hopefully never

533
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:17,679
because that will ultimately narrow down

534
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:21,668
genetics and lead into the problem we

535
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:25,330
originated from it's a it's a monster

536
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:27,159
deal so what I'm excited about is the

537
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:28,269
massive allowance of education that

538
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,700
we've been able to get from the internet

539
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:32,618
the availability of clean nutrition the

540
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,278
availability of clean mediums the

541
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:37,808
availability of good stable genetics

542
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:40,558
that we've been working on for decades

543
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:51,759
and breeding the same parents to create

544
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:53,950
repeatable seed crops so I've been doing

545
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,690
a lot of I've worked with brothers

546
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,399
grints for years I done work with

547
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,769
Nirvana I've done work with green house

548
00:19:57,398 --> 00:20:01,748
Barney's Paradise was a really

549
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:07,149
interesting kind of run for me because a

550
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:08,649
15 to 18 percent ice cream plant went

551
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:11,288
through mass spectrometry from a

552
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:13,118
greenhouse and hit 30 percent so

553
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:15,908
somewhere along the lines those genetics

554
00:20:13,118 --> 00:20:17,980
got upgraded but after going over what I

555
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:20,379
knew of it from the book of buds it sit

556
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,868
every format and profile of the original

557
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:24,788
genetic and that creamy flavor down to

558
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:26,470
the rock-hard flowers down to the you

559
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:29,349
know two and a half ounce maximum per

560
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:35,019
plant that I was seeing it was

561
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:37,089
phenomenal so really just about

562
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:38,259
anybody's good I like the older breeders

563
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:40,658
because they tend to have a certain

564
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:42,339
style I've been working aggressively

565
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:44,169
with ethos lately as well I've been

566
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:46,898
really excited with a lot of his limited

567
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:48,369
releases and like I said you know just

568
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:50,108
because it's limited just because it's a

569
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:53,528
one-time run doesn't mean that it's

570
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:55,658
truly a lazy man strain some of us may

571
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:57,029
call it that but it really is something

572
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:59,490
special and

573
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:01,710
maintain its being special some of these

574
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,930
guys will put out limited's that are not

575
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:07,069
just hey I had this accident and here

576
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:10,799
you go they're actually limited for

577
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:12,869
being awesome I mean we look at some of

578
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,359
the old like the reservoir soured the

579
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:17,099
reservoir Sour Diesel you couldn't

580
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,469
necessarily get that it was a cut only I

581
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:21,659
mean a lot of these old school strains

582
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,339
that were breeder strains and backbones

583
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,370
for a lot of these new new-school

584
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:29,549
genetics as well as old school genetics

585
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:31,139
came from that time period and what's

586
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:32,730
messed up about it is that bottle

587
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,790
necking because we're sitting in the

588
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,170
middle of that issue right now and we're

589
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:39,480
seeing that with the saturation of

590
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,250
cookies and glues I mean you look at any

591
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,750
breeders line and if they don't have a

592
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,970
glue or a cookie then they're not in

593
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,650
today's market that says something

594
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,019
because that's been in their shop the

595
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,300
potentiality for issues down the line

596
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:53,849
are there because that genetic is

597
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:55,649
everywhere it's one of those things

598
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:57,689
where it's cool until everybody has it

599
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,509
and that's been the cannabis game that's

600
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,799
kind of been our crowd and it's

601
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:03,869
important to remember that's where we

602
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,519
come from because that's gonna safeline

603
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:06,989
not only the future where we can have

604
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,119
things like the cookies in the glue come

605
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,250
out saturate the market but as long as

606
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,729
we recognize not to necessarily take

607
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,230
that as a crutch but to use it as a tool

608
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,789
that's going to be the biggest thing and

609
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,500
right now we're getting a good

610
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,180
equalization of people realizing that

611
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,609
it's more of a crutch than a tool right

612
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,940
now in most Gardens and that we need to

613
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:28,439
walk away from so as as much as I love

614
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,730
these genetics and have great respect

615
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,440
for the breeders because they did a lot

616
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,410
of hard work to get these phenomenal

617
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,539
things to the market there's a lot of

618
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,900
danger in the excitement that surrounds

619
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,690
them

620
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,330
so it's almost

621
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,370
it's almost dangerous to a certain level

622
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:46,049
so you know it's kind of been one of my

623
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:47,669
more focal points of concern in the

624
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:50,490
industry lately and one of the reasons

625
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:52,650
I've been focusing on terpenes because

626
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,269
turkeys are a really interesting profile

627
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,250
format that follows through those

628
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,259
genetic lines like the Haze's for

629
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,829
instance you'll smoke a lemonade she'll

630
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:04,799
smoke a silver haze you'll smoke super

631
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:06,779
Silver Haze and you will find that exact

632
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,759
terpene profile that's dominant in the

633
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:11,730
haze genome I have the same thing going

634
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:14,460
on in our elephant tooth which was a you

635
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,980
know blue ice cream which is blue tooth

636
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,400
from BC seeds before the scandal mixed

637
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,460
with elephant and paradises ice cream

638
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,610
and that one turned into a full-blown

639
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,529
hey it's based on the blue tooth genetic

640
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:30,240
now what was interesting about that was

641
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:32,430
the ice cream would have been the main

642
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,529
genetic producer I would have thought or

643
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,269
the dominant replicant based on the fact

644
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:38,279
that the seeds came from the ice cream

645
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:40,079
plant which is one of the reasons why I

646
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,539
really wanted it I thought hey that'd be

647
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,220
dominant well it doesn't always work

648
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:46,589
like that and that's something that

649
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,440
we're starting to also evolve and

650
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:51,750
recognizes it's not as easy as it seems

651
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,799
and it's it's interesting because if

652
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,349
we're paying attention it will show us

653
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,210
that constantly and we got a lot of

654
00:23:55,349 --> 00:24:00,659
interests in this market as far as

655
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:03,090
retention but we got a lot of people

656
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,560
wondering how to do that so if they're

657
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:06,089
wondering how to do that and it's their

658
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,460
end goal to do it currently it's not

659
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:13,369
being done and we're starting to see

660
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,370
that interfere with

661
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:22,079
you know I I think we beat that one up a

662
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,669
bit so I'm just gonna leave it there but

663
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,689
it's been a big bothersome reason for me

664
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,690
to be very bold
