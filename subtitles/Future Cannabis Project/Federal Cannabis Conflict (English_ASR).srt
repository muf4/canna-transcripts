glad to be on this panel about the

00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:13,560
federal conflict because the really

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,159
primary purpose of ncia is to make sure

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,479
that the industry has a seat at the

46
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:20,840
table in Washington DC to ultimately uh

47
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,518
take down the the barriers that that

48
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,479
Federal conflict poses to our businesses

49
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,039
uh and while we're not seeing uh those

50
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,439
of you who've been involved especially

51
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:31,719
in California for a long time may

52
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,120
remember the days where we were seeing

53
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,759
you know criminal uh justice actions

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,439
taken against medical cannabis

55
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,878
collectives throughout the state and the

56
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,199
the country on a regular basis while

57
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:47,479
fortunately that has has slowed way way

58
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:51,238
down uh there's other issues that uh in

59
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:53,119
some ways are more Insidious uh to to to

60
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,920
undermining the industry because of the

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,920
federal conflict primarily uh section

62
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,639
280e of the tax code uh which is a

63
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,318
little little known know to to most

64
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,119
people in this country but hopefully

65
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,878
very well known to those in this room uh

66
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,920
disallows any ordinary business

67
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,518
deductions Associated uh with the

68
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,199
trafficking quote unquote of cannabis

69
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,400
meaning your rents your marketing

70
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,919
payroll uh many of the the ordinary

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,640
expenses that any other business can

72
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,318
take for take for granted as an expense

73
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,839
uh can't in our industry and that has

74
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,798
many of our members facing 80 to even

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,640
90% effective tax rat rates as opposed

76
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,120
to 35% or so that that other comparable

77
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,919
businesses would face um the other big

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,840
issue that we're working on is resolving

79
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:47,199
the banking crisis so that businesses

80
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:49,239
can safely deposit their cash into uh a

81
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,079
depository institution into a bank not

82
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,000
have to run on a full you know some

83
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,599
operations are running entirely cash

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,759
only basis which is a public safety

85
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,878
nightmare uh and very costly to anybody

86
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,878
uh in the industry um we maintain a

87
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,199
full-time uh lobbying presence on the

88
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,959
hill working on these issues as well as

89
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,719
really the end goal which is ending

90
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,640
Federal prohibition removing cannabis

91
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,000
from the list of Controlled Substances

92
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,199
entirely and allowing states to regulate

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,519

under four different brands in two

135
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,720
different

136
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,919
states uh now I I got into the industry

137
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,759
about four years ago I'm a lawyer by

138
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:18,120
trade a recovering attorney and I I came

139
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,479
by way of private equity and I was uh

140
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,280
doing investment both private and

141
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,478
institutional money and Luxury Resorts

142
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:27,000
and hotels around the Caribbean and

143
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,879
Latin America so you can imagine I

144
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,319
actually love that so I found this

145
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,478
opportunity to be so compelling the

146
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,960
first time I ever walked into a large

147
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:40,439
scale grow it was just a eureca moment

148
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,879
for me and I knew that uh and after

149
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,319
doing research I realized this is a

150
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,680
multi-billion dollar industry clear

151
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,000
clear macr Trends towards legalization

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,400
and acceptance and yet not a dollar of

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,839
institutional capital and why is that

154
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,079
well it's because of the conflict with

155
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,198
federal law and so for the last four

156
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:03,198
years I've been trying to navigate that

157
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:05,439
process um thankfully I'm still free uh

158
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,680
I have fewer concerns today about my

159
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,839
door getting kicked in but that was that

160
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,639
was always a concern and it still is for

161
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,560
for many people things are getting

162
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,840
better but we have a a very far way to

163
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,160
go

164
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:21,598
still that's great thank you Adam um my

165

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,360
before there was much of an industry to

169
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,598
speak of so I've seen a lot of change in

170
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,360
the past 2 years I've been primarily

171
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:40,079
focused on raising money for our Arizona

172
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,120
legalization campaign and that's been

173
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,120
really fun for me the industry there is

174
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,560
pretty mature and um very actively

175
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,680
engaged in ending

176
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,158
prohibition so Aaron touched on these

177
00:07:50,680 --> 00:08:00,038
the three biggest issues uh Federal

178
00:07:54,158 --> 00:08:02,240
issues are 280e the tax issue banking

179
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:04,000
and I have donors all the time tell me

180
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,240
their check is going to be delayed

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,478
because their account got shut down so I

182
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,158
know it's real um and then the

183
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:14,918
Controlled Substances Act the need to

184
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:16,959
remove marijuana from it so I wonder if

185
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:19,799
one of you could jump in with which of

186
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,318
these you think is most pressing where

187
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,598
we're at on the issue and where we're

188
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:29,120
headed they're all pressing but

189
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:30,000
280e is uh our largest concern for sure

190
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,000
um

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,958
um the the history of how this all came

192
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,599
about um is that a lot of people don't

193
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,518
know and I actually wrote something

194
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,080
about this last week um that the United

195
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,600
States Supreme Court ruled that the

196
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,519
marijuana Tax Act of 1937 was

197
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,720
unconstitutional back in

198
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,959
1969 which led to the creation of the

199
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,600
Controlled Substances Act which was a

200
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,559
more constitutionally defensible

201
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,920
prohibition scheme than the one that

202
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,639
existed

203
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,838
the problem is that uh it was placed

204
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,639
into schedule one upon the creation by

205
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,320
the Nixon Administration temporarily

206
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:12,159
while they formed their handpick

207
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,200
commission uh to justify the science

208
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,278
behind making marijuana schedule one

209
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,320
controlled

210
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,639
substance the commission uh now referred

211
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
to as the Schaefer commission came back

212
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,000
and said marijuana should be

213
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,519
decriminalized but I guess at that point

214
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,958
uh the Nixon Administration did no

215
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,879
longer felt the need for scientific

216
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,399
justification and marijuana remains

217
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,200
skill one where it is to this day the

218
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,120
second thing that happened was in the'

219
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,160
70s an industrious drug dealer from

220
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:43,078
Minneapolis um uh took a bunch of

221
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:46,078
deductions for his business selling

222
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:48,399
cocaine and marijuana and he went to Tax

223
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,359
Court and successfully defended a

224
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,519
portion of those deductions so the

225
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,839
Congress responded with tax code IRS

226
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,879
code 280e in 1982 which said that you

227
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,800
cannot take standard deductions if you

228
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,120
are violating state or federal law in a

229
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:08,078
schedule one marijuana or schedule 2

230
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,078
cocaine controlled substance now we go

231
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,719
fast forward to 1996 where California

232
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,679
becomes the first state to opt out a

233
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,079
federal prohibition on the state level

234
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:21,759
in anyway uh under prop

235
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:23,359
215 and President Clinton who was just

236
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,559
reelected and wasn't going to face

237
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,159
another election asked Barry mcaffrey

238
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:33,239
his drugar the head of the ondcp to

239
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:36,278
craft a strategy to crush the new laws

240
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,240
and in that memo from December 20th 1996

241
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,799
the ondcp specifically all the stuff

242
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,159
that we saw happen for the last 20 years

243
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,799
are in that memo the raids everything

244
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:49,120
and they they spell out using 280e as a

245
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,078
weapon to crush the industry in the

246
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,240
Cradle so when you take a look at this

247
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:54,399
historically marijuana never should have

248
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,959
been the controlled substance act to

249
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,000
begin with that's number one and this is

250
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,439
on purpose it's not like the IRS

251
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,320
stumbled upon this code uh that was

252
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,680
there from 1982 and they're using it as

253
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,399
a weapon this was weaponized by the

254
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:13,199
Clinton Administration in

255
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:16,399
1996 as a as a Lynch pin in modern

256
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,120
Federal prohibition so what we need to

257
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,000
do is marijuana needs to be removed from

258
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,560
the control substance act entirely which

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
will take care of banking which will

260
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:27,759
take care of 28e in the interim uh we

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,519
we've heard from a lot of folks Ethan

262
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,720
was just here on this stage

263
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,759
uh I keep hearing from my friends in the

264
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,839
Cannabis legalization movement that a

265
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,799
lot of the philanthropists that have

266
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,160
historically funded the movement are

267
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,759
pulling back they're pulling they're

268
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:44,439
giving back so they're looking to us in

269
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,958
the industry to fill that Gap but we're

270
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,040
being kept small and poor on purpose

271
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,359
dealing with an effective tax rate of

272
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,599
upwards of 80% because we can't take any

273
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
standard business deductions based on

274
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,200
tax code

275
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,800
280e so this is it this is the Lynch pin

276
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,800
to to prohibition remove marijuana from

277
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,919
the controlled substance act entirely

278
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:08,159
like tobacco like alcohol where it was

279
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,519
never meant to be get rid of 280e and

280
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,838
then yeah we can end prohibition once

281
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,839
and for

282
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:17,759
all thank you

283
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,879
Neil I I want to shift and ask H how

284
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,720
does some of this tie into to what's

285
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,240
happening at the state level like like

286
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,800
what are we seeing happening at the

287
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,440
state level that could positively or

288
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,879
negatively impact these issues

289
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,760
well you know obviously we have a huge

290
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:38,278
election coming up on November 8th uh

291
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:41,000
that will has the potential if we

292
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:43,519
succeed in California and at least a

293
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,958
majority of the eight other states to

294
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,120
really reshape the debate around

295
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,919
marijuana um it's absolutely vital that

296
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,440
uh as an industry that we're supporting

297
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:56,198
those efforts at the state level because

298
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,839
uh there's a direct correlation between

299
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:59,399
the state policies and what's happening

300
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,399
in Congress you know members of Congress

301
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,839
are very timid they're they're already

302
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,480
probably 20 30 years behind public

303
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,440
opinion on this issue as it is uh they

304
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,879
tend to only really care about what's

305
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,160
happening in their districts and their

306
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:15,600
backyard and if you look at you know if

307
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,559
you look at this election you know right

308
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,959
now we have less than two dozen just

309
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:22,838
over 20 I think members of the House of

310
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:26,359
Representatives that represent the four

311
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,839
adult youth States uh and after if if we

312
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,800
pass all five this year this be what

313
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,440
over 100 that will be representing

314
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:36,159
states where marijuana is legal and

315
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,839
regulated uh not to mention uh 34 or so

316
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,399
of the house and a majority of the

317
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,639
Senate representing states that have

318
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,799
some form of regulated uh marijuana that

319
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,320
departs from federal law meaning medical

320
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,078
Canabis um so I think that that uh you

321
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,399
know we're already seeing the issue

322
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:56,000
being taken more and more seriously

323
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:59,399
after uh you know amendment 64 and i502

324
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,759
passed uh in 2012 uh we're going to see

325
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,919
another big flood of of interest uh in

326
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,759
this issue and resolving the federal

327
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,759
conflict uh because you know if you

328
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:14,000
think about like California here alone

329
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:17,240
in by 2020 if uh given passage of 64 uh

330
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,600
in November the the market here alone

331
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,440
could be upwards of $7 billion like the

332
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,959
size of the whole the whole country

333
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,560
right now and if we don't fix things

334
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,958
like Banking 28e and the bank banking

335
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,119
issue specifically is one that is very

336
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,838
uh kind of pressing for our opponents

337
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,799
and those who maybe don't really care

338
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,360
about whether our businesses succeed but

339
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:39,958
they want to resolve that because that's

340
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,639
$7 billion that's outside of the banking

341
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:46,039
system and and creating Public Safety

342
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,000
hazards and transparency issues so uh

343
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:49,719
that that alone I think is you know one

344
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,278
of the biggest things that we you know

345
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,440
and clearly is pressing because I think

346
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,838
that that's I think it's six weeks away

347
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,440
from tomorrow that we have uh this

348
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,240
election before us and um it's also

349
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,639
really critical that as industries

350
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,959
develop in new states that that the

351
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,759
industry be involved not not just

352
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:11,319
involved through the association of

353
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,879
course but involved in in local politics

354
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,160
involved with with their members of

355
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,159
Congress and meet you know meeting with

356
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,799
their members of Congress in the

357
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:19,319
districts attending fundraisers giving

358
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,078
money uh I know you know I know that

359
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,240
we're all asking for money but those

360
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:26,198
members of Congress who support our

361
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,839
issues deserve your support and as the

362
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:30,758
more States flip there will be more uh

363
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,759
you know what ncia is you know what we

364
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,519
do is we work to build coalitions and

365
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,959
move move the members of Congress kind

366
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,720
of along the ladder so you know the the

367
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,799
moderate opponents are now you'll now

368
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,720
seeing them come on board as you know

369
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:46,719
championing uh things like CBD access

370
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,079
and those are laws that we probably you

371
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,879
know largely ineffectual CBD laws but

372
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,000
they're pushing something those that

373
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,679
were just for medical are now moving

374
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,958
along and and supporting just a full

375
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,159
states rights approach to adult adult

376
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,879
use and we'll just I think we're going

377
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,838
to see that that uh

378
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,039
exponentially uh that pace increase

379
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:07,279
after November if if we're successful

380
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,879
and that's that's uh what's absolutely

381
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,240
important that we all know that this is

382
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,078
not inevitable because if the opposite

383
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,440
happens and California loses or a

384
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,919
majority of the other states uh go down

385
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,240
the narrative will change and especially

386
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,000
with California the headline will will

387
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,198
say you know public not ready for

388
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,519
marijuana legalization so get out and

389
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,078
vote and donate

390
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,078
money can thank you can I jump in real

391
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:35,519
quick uh one real world application on

392
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,599
the state level to Federal prohibition I

393
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,078
think is really uh and this I'm talking

394
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,800
about impact on people I see my friend

395
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:43,599
Sue sisly sitting in the front right

396
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:46,559
here

397
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,040
so a bunch of you probably know that

398
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,359
Congress through the appropriation

399
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:53,759
process was going to allow veterans to

400
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,839
go to the VA in states that have medical

401
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,000
marijuana laws and not be subject to

402
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,319
sanction for getting their medicine and

403
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,480
actually being transparent open and

404
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:05,199
working with the VA and that was killed

405
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:09,240
so because of the federal conflict

406
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:12,000
veterans with with conditions protected

407
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,798
under state law who are going through

408
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,359
the VA or are worried about the

409
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:19,679
retirement cannot go into medical

410
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:22,240
marijuana systems in Colorado uh where I

411
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,839
live PTSD Is Not An approved condition

412
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,199
it looks like the legislature is going

413
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:29,519
to move on that finally in 2017 knock on

414
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:31,320
wood hopefully but that's a real impact

415
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,359
and then when you get down into Aaron's

416
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,119
100% right on the policy impacts but the

417
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,240
real life impacts down the state level

418
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,000
with Federal prohibition it's just when

419
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,880
it when when when they get so toned deaf

420
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,839
that they're putting our veterans

421
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,760
retirement at risk and their health at

422
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:49,678
risk how can you not be disgusted with

423
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:50,599
the state of federal Prohibition in in

424
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,000
its

425
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:57,439
entirety and Adam I want to and and if I

426
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,599
may it's not just the veterans it's the

427
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,679
youth it's every everyone this we're not

428
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,000
creating a new market here this product

429
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,120
exists what we're doing is providing an

430
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,960
opportunity to test it regulate it and

431
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,918
tax it it's time for the federal

432
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,919
government to get its head out of its

433
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:17,000
ass and deal with this the right way we

434
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,600
and the public policy around the banking

435
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,599
in particular is just terrible I mean we

436
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,599
live in a different world financially

437
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:27,079
post 911 and the government strives for

438
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:28,798
transparency and accountability and yes

439
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:31,319
they yet they want to force this

440
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:34,558
multi-billion Dollar Cash Underground

441
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:36,720
Market which sets sets us up for all

442
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,798
kinds of problems from tax evasion money

443
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,679
laundering theft physical insecurity for

444
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:43,879
people who are transferring uh money

445
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,840
from one location to another it's just

446
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,799
terrible public

447
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:51,038
policy speaking of real world impacts

448
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:54,558
Adam I mean I want I'm interested in

449
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:59,000
knowing in your business dealings with

450
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:01,839
clients um how are they impacted by

451
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,798
Federal prohibition and how what steps

452
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:07,319
are you able to take to try to lessen

453
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,759
the risk lessen the impact on them are

454
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,960
you asking specifically like my clients

455
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,720
or my investors and the people I work

456
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,038
with yeah your investors any any of the

457
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,159
folks that you deal with through M

458
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:20,319
hardine or through any of your business

459
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,159
entities you know originally the way

460
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,079
that we structured the company now mind

461
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:26,280
you this is going back several years so

462
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,960
things were even more challenging

463
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,399
imagine trying to ask somebody to write

464
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,038
aill million dollar check for a

465
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,798
federally illegal business everyone's

466
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,319
very interested in the industry we hear

467
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:39,200
that we feel it every day but when push

468
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,319
comes to shove to write that check I

469
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,400
can't tell you how many calls I've had

470
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:46,038
you know the day of a closing where my

471
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,798
wife's not comfortable with this my

472
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:50,279
lawyer advised me not to do this so you

473
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,079
you really need to structure in a way

474
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,440
that protects your investors the way we

475
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,798
did that is we formed a separate um

476
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,600
intellectual property holding company

477
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:02,400
that would never touch the plant it

478
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:05,519
simply licensed the IP to the operating

479
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,159
company and kept a degree of separation

480
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,480
but it's it's not bulletproof um but

481
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:14,360
that's that's one thing that we've done

482
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,120
okay um so I'm curious what can can one

483
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:18,839
of you or several of you paint the

484
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:21,519
picture for me what does the end of

485
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:24,480
federal prohibition look like where are

486
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,720
we headed ideally and maybe actually

487
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,960
after the big

488
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:32,360
party yes

489
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,919
um well you know there's this is

490
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,959
actually a very important question we

491
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,440
could have several panel discussions on

492
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,960
this alone because there are a lot of

493
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,279
different I think there's eight

494
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,759
different legalization bills right now

495
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:49,639
pending in Congress um ranging from just

496
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:51,079
pure states rights where remove uh like

497
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,280
the Sanders bill and the Senate remove

498
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:57,079
cannabis from the CSA and just defer to

499
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:59,119
the states uh to a more uh alcohol

500
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,359
related model that has a federal excise

501
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:05,519
tax but still uh puts

502
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,199
marijuana uh regulation primarily under

503
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,558
the purview of the states and then

504
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,720
there's also move to to reschedule uh

505
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,519
marijuana rather than deschedule it and

506
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,360
put it in a two or three uh category and

507
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,599
and so in my in you know from an

508
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,038
industry perspective probably the worst

509
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:24,918
thing we could do is

510
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:27,079
rescheduling uh because that would

511
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:28,520
essentially create a whole you know

512
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:31,918
create a whole new Juris ition that

513
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:33,278
we're dealing with the FDA uh that you

514
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,440
know you're not going to get clinical

515
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:38,919
trials of you know raw cannabis strains

516
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,720
approved through the FDA and and even if

517
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,520
you did that those would only be

518
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,600
dispensed through pharmacies and pretty

519
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:47,319
much everybody in this in this room is

520
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:49,439
no longer in business except maybe a few

521
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:52,798
uh possibly that that might be able to

522
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,720
to navigate that um so what we what we

523
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:58,558
want to see is cannabis to be treated

524
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,319
more similarly to alcohol uh not not

525
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:05,759
under the purview of the FDA under the

526
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:08,558
purview of ATF ATF NC um that would also

527
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,119
allow still defer to the states uh so

528
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:14,599
that states can continue to experiment

529
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,918
with different regulatory models and uh

530
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,558
you know so that we can continue to have

531
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,759
this laboratory of democracy and and

532
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:23,678
frankly I think that's more

533
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,720
politically winnable uh than because it

534
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,240
would still allow states that are really

535
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,960
really backwards to maybe just have IAL

536
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,960
marijuana for a few more years and we're

537
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,720
not so as far as when it goes to you

538
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,440
know like I said most members of

539
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,798
Congress care about their district and

540
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,480
what's happening in their state so we

541
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:42,038
can go to somebody who represents you

542
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,519
know North Carolina and say well

543
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:45,679
actually this doesn't affect you until

544
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,960
your state legislature you know makes

545
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,480
makes a change um so there's a lot

546
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,558
there's also I think something that we

547
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,839
need to be really concerned about is

548
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:58,480
there are growing uh influencers in the

549
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,519
space that are starting to acknowledge

550
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,919
that you know marijuana prohibition

551
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:05,119
isn't working or maybe they're just

552
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,880
acknowledging that it's on its way out

553
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,839
anyway and that legalization is

554
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,720
inevitable and they are proposing models

555
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,359
that would not be good for the the

556
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,159
Cannabis industry and that would not be

557
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,079
good with P for patients or consumers

558
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,919
models like state run stores where

559
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:23,000
government employees would be tasked

560
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,200
with with selling marijuana and

561
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,679
marijuana users would have to get onto a

562
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,000
registry uh to in order to access sort

563
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,679
of like the uh the heroin model in the

564
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,200
UK um and those those forces are out

565
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,960
there uh one you know one of them is you

566
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,519
know botch is uh uh you know hired by

567
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,480
some of the State uh regul Regulators

568
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,960
throughout the country is pushing that

569
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,120
model uh and as this you know as this

570
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,720
issue heats up uh our our voice will be

571
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,959
Amplified but so will theirs and we

572
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,000
really as an industry need to unify to

573
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,640
make sure that that's not the direction

574
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,119
that we take that that that we take

575
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,038
reform because uh they're they're they

576
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:07,038
do have a seat at the table as it is and

577
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:10,480
it will uh they will continue to gain

578
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,919
influence yeah Erin um just piggybacking

579
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,679
on that I have been hearing more and

580
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:19,278
more about companies offering compliance

581
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:23,200
related solutions for the Cannabis

582
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:24,919
industry that um they feel have a strong

583
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,480
foothold in the marketplace because the

584
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,880
government is looking for all these um

585
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,960
trans parency mechanisms to make sure

586
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,080
that the Cannabis industry is compliant

587
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,159
and um but some of the ones I've heard

588
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:40,038
about so far are really scary sounding

589
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,520
and and along the lines of what you were

590
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:45,679
just talking about like um causing every

591
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,759
Canabis consumer at a dispensary to have

592
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,038
to show their driver's license and every

593
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:53,798
every transaction would therefore be

594
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,679
recorded um is that the direction that

595
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:59,319
we're headed in a complete lack of

596
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,399
privacy for all can abis

597
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:03,639
consumers well I I don't think that

598
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:04,639
that's necessary um I think I think what

599
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,320
you're getting at with some of the

600
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,278
compliance solutions that are that

601
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,879
you're seeing out there and not to talk

602
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,919
about any companies and specifically um

603
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,000
they're providing solutions for banks

604
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,000
because the banks are now under

605
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
direction from you know under the the

606
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,278
guidance from finsen in the Department

607
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,119
of Treasury and Department of Justice uh

608
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:25,480
they have guidance that basically says

609
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,359
you know what you can do business with

610
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,960
state legal into uh marijuana businesses

611
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,678
but oversight of the compliance their

612
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,200
compliance and their legality under

613
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,038
state law is your responsibility to

614
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,319
track that so of course banks are

615
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:40,720
extremely conservative institutions and

616
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:42,240
I don't think they should be put in that

617
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,960
position when you have a state license

618
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,079
hanging on the wall and regular state

619
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,038
inspections and such but that's the

620
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,439
current the current state and so some of

621
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,919
these Solutions are there to so that the

622
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,798
banks can have that level of comfort to

623
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,360
fill the Gap to fill the Gap so once we

624
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:59,158
address the banking issue we can kind of

625
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,558
do away with those concerns it sounds

626
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,520
like right okay it looks like you had

627
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:08,240
yeah I think it all it all runs together

628
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,918
right it and as these gentleman

629
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,359
indicated rescheduling is not a good

630
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,919
option and frankly I'm glad that the DEA

631
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,079
declined to do that in this this summer

632
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,759
because they think that the best they

633
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:20,639
would have done was to make it a a

634
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:22,079
schedule two and that would have done no

635
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,399
one any favor it just sort of

636
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,798
complicated the matter uh it needs to be

637
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:28,879
three or lower or completely removed

638
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,679
which is the most apprpriate and once

639
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,200
you do that you solve the banking almost

640
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,679
automatically I believe uh you'll start

641
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,480
to see institutional Capital come into

642
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:43,080
the industry in very significant ways uh

643
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,919
280e goes away we start to normalize so

644
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:47,199
this is really the Crux of the issue it

645
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,640
needs to be

646
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,159
descheduled so if you want to ask a

647
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,600
question please come up here to the

648
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,559
front corner where Susan is

649
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,719
standing okay so the question was

650
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:59,918
basically why are we talking about

651
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,440
regulating cannabis like alcohol rather

652
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,399
than like a medication that's not really

653
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,278
a federal question unfortunately because

654
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:12,079
we're not necessarily proposing um

655
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,558
Federal Regulations like alcohol like I

656
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:17,240
guess alcohol is regulated by the ATF

657
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,278
but not as granularly as it is at the

658
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,798
state level is that right right and I

659
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:24,839
and and you know a lot of it is about

660
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:29,158
like okay there what models already

661
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:31,839
exist what's politically possible and in

662
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,679
my mind what's it's it's going to be

663
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:37,678
much harder to create some you know

664
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,679
third regulatory regime that's that that

665
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,960
has never been invented before and get

666
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,880
that through Congress so it's really FDA

667
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,720
the pharmaceutical you know that

668
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,240
direction or something more similar to

669
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,798
alcohol and and I think that you know

670
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,038
that what's best for the industry is to

671
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:55,639
not try to shove this down into the

672
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:57,640
because this is also not a dangerous

673
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,840
pharmaceutical it shouldn't be treated

674
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,120
like oxycotton or or any you know it's

675
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:06,959
it's safer it's a safer substance than

676
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,959
most over-the-counter drugs for that

677
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,079
matter but but those are State she's

678
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,640
saying every city in the US has Public

679
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,119
Health departments again that's state

680
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,960
level and we're we're really talking

681
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,359
about Federal level policy here this

682
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,399
this should be taken out of the hands of

683
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,439
the federal government altogether the

684
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,639
best model that I've seen is just to

685
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,720
Simply create a safe Harbor for the

686
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,159
states that choose to regulate it allow

687
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,200
the states to do what they want to do

688
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,080
with it and a number of things are

689
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,679
accomplished there and one of the things

690
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,000
that we'll see now in a number of these

691
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,278
states they have very well developed

692
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,798
programs that are creating a lot of jobs

693
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:46,720
and a lot of tax revenue Colorado last

694
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,798
year generated twice the amount of tax

695
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,759
revenue for marijuana that they did for

696
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:54,480
alcohol $1 billion of direct marijuana

697
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,919
purchases last year Colorado is not just

698
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,200
going to fold that up they're going to

699
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,679
protect that system and all the states

700
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,278
presumably many of the states will want

701
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,278
to do the same thing the federal

702
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,359
government simply needs to back off and

703
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,839
allow the states to regulate it yeah

704
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,759
money makes the world go around it's an

705
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:10,879
incentive to to the point on the federal

706
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:12,319
level you know we do want it to be like

707
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,120
alcohol and that we want it removed from

708
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:19,359
the CSA entirely right and you know the

709
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:22,759
the we don't want to be in the FDA

710
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,359
system the FDA system if we go into re

711
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:26,720
open up research what does that actually

712
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:28,158
mean that means spend tens of millions

713
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,679
of dollars

714
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,480
to find something that you can replicate

715
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:35,679
that then gets rescheduled like Marinol

716
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,159
into schedule 3 I mean is that what we

717
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,640
want for whole plant marijuana I mean

718
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,679
the FDA system is not now can can

719
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,480
pharmaceutical companies derrive

720
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,798
cannabis-based medicine through the FDA

721
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,960
system that gets prescribed yes

722
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:52,000
absolutely but to take marijuana and put

723
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,120
it schedule two or even schedule three

724
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,038
and put it into the FDA system is not

725
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:57,319
where the plan is supposed to be in our

726
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:59,839
opinion it should be removed from the

727
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:02,079
CSA entirely though there is a role for

728
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,959
the FDA certainly when it comes to Pure

729
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:07,319
Pharma and the development of drugs that

730
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,840
are designed to uh address very specific

731
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:11,158
ailments and you want to go through the

732
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:13,759
clinical trials and the fa approval

733
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,320
process for that so I really see two

734
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,398
Divergent paths one being a pure Pharma

735
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,038
play and the other being everything else

736
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:24,278
the neutraceuticals the adult use soft

737
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,558
medical Etc right okay any other

738
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:27,319
questions from the audience please come

739
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:29,398
up here to Susan so you can use this the

740
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:31,439
the microphone thanks a lot uh really

741
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:33,639
appreciate your Insight um the question

742
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,798
I have is how do you as two physical

743
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,000
retailers feel about delivery and what

744
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:38,960
do you see as the future of kind of

745
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,519
delivery in Colorado or the other states

746
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,519
that you operate

747
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:49,840
in we both want to jump on that one

748
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:54,079
um that's interesting um you know as a

749
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:55,638
general policy as a company um we tend

750
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,558
to be pretty I think everybody in the

751
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:59,839
industry tends to be pretty adaptable

752
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:02,960
when it comes to local regulations right

753
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,599
so you know when it comes to to to

754
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,600
something like delivery that that's very

755
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:11,079
much a local issue as far as the history

756
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:12,278
uh delivery in Colorado I I I don't hear

757
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,359
anything about allowing delivery in

758
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:16,398
Colorado anytime soon and you know if we

759
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,439
were in a jurisdiction that allowed

760
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:19,918
delivery maybe we'd consider it we're

761
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,320
not so we haven't had that internal

762
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,278
discussion I don't know there there are

763
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,918
there there are bright obviously

764
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:27,599
delivery especially when you're dealing

765
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:33,278
with patients that could be a huge

766
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:36,480
benefit um the the the I I think that uh

767
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:37,798
as far as we're concerned um we there

768
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,038
there are certain things that we are

769
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:42,119
really really concerned about right we

770
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:45,240
are concerned about 280e we are

771
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,918
concerned about banking other stuff

772
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,798
where it's you know we're pretty

773
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:52,480
malleable with if the businesses in this

774
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:55,638
industry are pretty they're as tough and

775
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,960
as Hardy as the plan right so um when it

776
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:58,678
comes to local stuff like that we can

777
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,960
kind kind of go with the roll with the

778
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:04,159
punches uh but uh we haven't had to deal

779
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,639
with it we're only in Colorado so as a

780
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,440
company we don't even have a position on

781
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:11,719
that Nevada allows for delivery uh I I

782
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,558
look at it honestly as more of

783
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,038
a pain than anything good from from an

784
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,720
economic standpoint as the business

785
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,720
owner certainly you're providing a

786
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,880
valuable service for people who are

787
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,159
Indigent or somehow inconvenience or

788
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,799
simply can't go to a location to to buy

789
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,919
the product so there's certainly some

790
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,359
Public Service benefit to that but as a

791
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,639
business owner it's certainly not a um a

792
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:38,759
Big Driver of the business I'd like to

793
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:42,278
see drive-throughs I think that could be

794
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:43,720
interesting and social use clubs those

795
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:45,599
are those would be more important to me

796
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,880
than than focused on

797
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,519
delivery okay other questions can you go

798
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,399
back to your banking system with regards

799
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,960
to uh federal law uh you had basically

800
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:58,119
said that it's there's no federal

801
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,919
prohibition but the burden is so great

802
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:01,359
uh that banks are choosing not to can

803
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,159
you speak more to

804
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,599
that well there is federal prohibition

805
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,320
but there's there's guidance that was uh

806
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:11,480
released in 2014 by Department of

807
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:14,918
Treasury and Department of Justice

808
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,798
jointly that essentially outlined the

809
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:18,679
priorities of Jus of the justice

810
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,480
department in their enforcement against

811
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,200
state legal businesses which to be clear

812
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,639
all of them no matter how compliant they

813
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,000
are are committing felonies every time

814
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:30,839
they open their door uh but but the

815
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,440
Obama administrations you know had their

816
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,000
guidelines which were things that I

817
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,360
think everybody here can agree on no

818
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,359
diversion out of state no ties to you

819
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:41,599
know violent criminal Enterprises no

820
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:44,158
sales to miners uh ensuring you know

821
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:46,599
100% compliance with with all the state

822
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,278
guidelines and so but they they left

823
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:51,158
that burden to the banks at least the

824
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:54,038
way that it's been interpreted it was

825
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:55,440
it's sort of it's sort of vague actually

826
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:58,359
but the way that it's been interpreted

827
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,080
pretty much univ un Al is that it's up

828
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:03,759
to the banks to know their customer and

829
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,798
ensure that all of these guidelines are

830
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,960
being met so therefore a bank wouldn't

831
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:09,639
want to take a very conservative one

832
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,559
would would be would not want to take

833
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,599
the client uh unless they knew 100% that

834
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,199
client wasn't selling to miners so how

835
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,919
how does a bank do that without being in

836
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,519
the in the store um the way that you

837
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,398
know what we asked for you know that was

838
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,239
a step forward when we got that guidance

839
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:28,519
but it was a compromise to what we were

840
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:30,118
asking for which was that if a if a a

841
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:32,159
client could walk into a bank and

842
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,679
present a valid you know all of the

843
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,159
paperwork that they to show that they

844
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,320
have a license in their state and in

845
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,599
their local jurisdiction then the bank

846
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,359
would would treat them like any other

847
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:43,159
business but this again uh politics is

848
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:46,319
often about compromises and that's what

849
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:48,720
we got um there's other you know the

850
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,879
real solution is to carve out in the

851
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:54,878
statute uh Safe Harbor to banks that do

852
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:56,398
business with uh any state legal

853
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:57,920
marijuana operation and that would be an

854
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:59,559
amendment to the the bank secrecy act

855
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,960
and there's there's legislation pending

856
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:03,679
right now to do to do just that uh so

857
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,400
the guidance is really a Band-Aid and

858
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,519
then all of the other compliant software

859
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,240
and things that um that have kind of

860
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,039
popped up for banks to use or or part of

861
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,838
that

862
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:16,639
Band-Aid interestingly enough um I'm

863
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:18,358
we're fortunate all of our companies

864
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,039
including our dispensaries are fully

865
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:22,759
banked and we have open transparent and

866
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,358
good relationships with all of our banks

867
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,960
they know exactly what we do uh we have

868
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,440
audited financials for all of our

869
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,480
companies and we've been doing this for

870
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,960
a few years now and yet on the personal

871
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,519
side I bank with a big national bank and

872
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,400
they shut down all my accounts last week

873
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:44,000
so it's it's still I mean it's this is a

874
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,960
real issue it's not going away MPP also

875
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,639
has difficulty getting banking services

876
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,400
and we don't do anything illegal so it's

877
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,358
frustrating and we have banking too but

878
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,440
when we say banking there a huge we have

879
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:57,318
banking right we have check deposit

880
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,838
services that we pay in a norm amount of

881
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:00,960
money for we don't have commercial

882
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:03,880
banking services we can't get a loan you

883
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,480
know there there's so so we don't have

884
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,519
banking but yes some of the folks that

885
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,920
are able to establish a relationship

886
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:12,920
with their Banks and show that this is

887
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,639
who we are and we can be transparent

888
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,519
that yes we have access to banking

889
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,879
services but it's always a struggle and

890
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:21,559
then and and stuff always gets ripped

891
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,519
out and you'll have a you'll have a

892
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:25,519
vendor that's dealing with you that all

893
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,880
of a sudden will randomly call and say

894
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,159
we can't deal with you anymore cuz we

895
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,400
got shut down over here if we're dealing

896
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,598
with you um and so and personal banking

897
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:37,039
accounts being pulled and on and on and

898
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:41,039
on and on losing Payroll Services

899
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:43,599
Etc hi Jon Irvine um I was involved in

900
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,039
policy and child protection in the adult

901
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:49,280
entertainment industry and talking about

902
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:51,440
an industry that was legal and still

903
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,760
could not get banking accounts it was

904
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,440
make me you know five or six Banks

905
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,079
across the country that could you know

906
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,240
would work with them and then they they

907
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,640
would disappear and even as a Child

908
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:05,799
Protection Association in a 501c3 and

909
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:09,239
four they questioned our banking account

910
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,839
so even with it becoming legalized don't

911
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,519
you think that there's still going to be

912
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:16,239
that same issue and what can really be

913
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:18,039
done around that cuz we were you no when

914
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,959
I was in that industry it was not

915
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:21,880
something that was really being handled

916
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,119
very

917
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,240
well we could

918
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,440
remove we could remove cannabis from the

919
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:31,879
CSA entirely that could be that's what

920
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,880
could be done that's the

921
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,759
idea like Adam said this is all

922
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,719
related this is all related this all

923
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,680
part of the federal prohibition

924
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:45,399
scheme and there's one thing that you

925
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:47,919
can all do about this go

926
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,880
vote go vote and we continue to fight

927
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,318
the good fight we have made a tremendous

928
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,318
amount of progress over the last few

929
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:55,639
years I've seen a sea change from when I

930
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:57,679
got involved in the industry hopefully

931
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:59,559
we're at that Tipping Point Point uh but

932
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:03,239
as Aaron indicated it could go either

933
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:05,239
way if um a number or a majority or God

934
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:08,039
willing all of these referend to pass

935
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:10,078
this year there's no turning back if on

936
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:13,079
the other hand we have a setback and few

937
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,839
or none of these initiatives pass we we

938
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,480
set back quite a few

939
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:19,159
years the other thing you do is you can

940
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,880
uh contact your congressman and you can

941
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:23,679
contact your Senator um in Congressional

942
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,800
offices they have the 100 to1 rule for

943
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:29,838
every contact they receive they figure

944
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:32,160
it represents 100 people so contact your

945
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,119
congressmen if they contact if they are

946
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,679
good on this issue thank them if they're

947
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:39,079
not ask them why put on social whatever

948
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:41,639
they put you as put as a response either

949
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,440
praising them or shaming them this is

950
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:45,639
this has got to get done through the US

951
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,960
Congress the the good thing is I don't

952
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:49,000
think there's much to be gained

953
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,920
politically for most at the state or

954
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,719
federal level to be fighting cannabis as

955
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,519
much as they once were at least we're

956
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:57,358
talking about it now four or five years

957
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,039
ago there's very little discussion in

958
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:02,719
the halls of Congress about changing the

959
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:05,000
laws around cannabis although

960
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:07,519
unfortunately in two of our initiative

961
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,358
States it's the governor who's actually

962
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:12,719
spearheading the opposition effort

963
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,598
that's in Massachusetts and Arizona and

964
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,000
Neil was just telling me about Harry

965
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,680
Reid in Nevada coming out against our

966
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,599
initiative so unfortunately these folks

967
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,480
do still need to hear from their

968
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,880
constituents and hear that indeed they

969
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,838
are they're hardworking business people

970
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,119
they support a better approach to to how

971
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:33,440
we regulate

972
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:37,480
marijuana and for the record the the

973
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,800
governor the AG the mayor of Boston they

974
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,240
all came out against us in 2008 for DM

975
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,960
in Massachusetts and we got 63% of the

976
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:48,039
votes so awes more than Obama got you

977
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,760
know at at some 65% of the vote in

978
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:52,440
Massachusetts actually so you know at

979
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,640
some point you know the endorsement game

980
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,480
people I think are seeing through this

981
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:57,118
for what it is right especially when it

982
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,559
gets to those folks I think think you

983
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,519
know it's it's dog bites man for the

984
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:05,000
governor to say that they're against

985
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:06,679
legalizing marijuana right um but the

986
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,199
news is really the other way and that's

987
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:11,199
even getting less and less um but it's a

988
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,679
really good point though is that we have

989
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,559
this stubborn

990
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:16,199
misperception that the people are not

991
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,358
where they are and the politicians are

992
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:20,919
behind the people and that's the key

993
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:22,480
Point here and so you know we wouldn't

994
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,519
be where we are if it wasn't for direct

995
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,800
democracy and unfortunately at the state

996
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,400
level it's taken us almost as far as we

997
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,839
can go the California initiative is

998
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,480
enormous and it has to pass this

999
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:37,000
November but we are now positioning

1000
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,960
ourselves we have to affect change on

1001
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,199
the federal level it takes a lot of work

1002
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,119
to unwind 70 years of

1003
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:47,559
misinformation and and also add like

1004
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,440
it's we've made a lot of progress if you

1005
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:54,039
you know when we count noses in you know

1006
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,679
in Congress like counting votes I I'm

1007
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:57,480
pretty confident we have the votes for a

1008
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,399
medical marijuana

1009
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,519
law already as it stands I we've seen

1010
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,920
rakar pass on you know more than one

1011
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,960
year running um we we're only maybe half

1012
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,079
a dozen votes away in the house from

1013
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,720
some form of States you know support for

1014
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:16,079
some form of states rights around

1015
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:18,358
marijuana entirely um and a lot of what

1016
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,519
we're up against now are are just the

1017
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:21,719
general dysfunction of Congress and that

1018
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,199
you know if you've been paying any

1019
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:25,199
attention you know Congress hasn't done

1020
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:28,239
anything uh this entire you know their

1021
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,879
entire two years the in this session so

1022
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,199
next year we have a really good

1023
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,358
opportunity given success on the ballot

1024
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:35,399
in November uh given that we're going to

1025
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,799
be in the first year of a new

1026
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,280
Administration whichever Administration

1027
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,359
that ends up being uh we have a huge

1028
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,319
opportunity to just as long as we don't

1029
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:48,078
screw this up I think that we can see uh

1030
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:49,920
280e reform banking reform and

1031
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,039
ultimately uh the end of federal

1032
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,838
marijuana prohibition uh across the

1033
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:59,318
country thanks Aaron

1034
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:02,679
so on the federal question on the on the

1035
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:05,480
presidential election coming up um I've

1036
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:08,358
heard a lot of people say that the Trump

1037
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,039
and Clinton are very similar candidates

1038
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:11,719
in terms of their stance on marijuana

1039
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:15,079
which is essentially let the states kind

1040
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:17,559
of do their thing but there is one area

1041
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:21,160
where they differ significantly and that

1042
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:24,318
is in who they plan to pick for AG

1043
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:27,078
attorney general can you all speak to

1044
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:29,679
what impact that may or may not have on

1045
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:31,359
marijuana policy going forward I don't

1046
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,279
think the candidates are the same

1047
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:37,159
Hillary has come out and said that she

1048
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,960
will pursue um rescheduling probably not

1049
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:40,920
nearly as aggressively as we might like

1050
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,039
to see but worst case we're going to

1051
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,159
have status quo I can live with that

1052
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,318
Trump's Wild Card nobody knows what he's

1053
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:49,879
going to do or who he's going to appoint

1054
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,599
I heard him give a speech in the last

1055
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,119
week talking about the great scourge of

1056
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:56,920
drugs on our nation's youth it's the

1057
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,640
same old shit we've been hearing ing for

1058
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:03,358
my entire lifetime so I I think that

1059
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:06,679
that is uh the riskier of the the two

1060
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:09,159
options one man's opinion at the risk of

1061
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:12,919
offending any Republican friends in the

1062
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:15,199
audience um I refuse to acknowledge

1063
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:19,358
Trump as a normal candidate in any way

1064
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:21,598
shape or form so you know he's running a

1065
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,759
racist misogynistic campaign and he's

1066
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,720
trying to bring fascism to America and I

1067
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,079
reject him entirely so I won't I won't

1068
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:30,838
even take the question there's no

1069
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:34,280
there's nothing similar between them as

1070
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:34,279
candidates yes thank

1071
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,480
you um yeah he's he's just like such a a

1072
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,039
wild card he has he has said some good

1073
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,039
things on marijuana but he's also said

1074
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,759
some really disastrous things he's too

1075
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:50,119
too close to Chris Christie uh for me to

1076
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,200
be comfortable with him uh so yeah

1077
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:55,039
beware that's a danger right that he

1078
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:56,838
points chrisy as AG yeah that's that's

1079
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,000
what I'm really getting at the the

1080
00:43:56,838 --> 00:44:00,400
danger is we give them the nuke codes is

1081
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,679
I'm sorry we give them the nuclear codes

1082
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,440
that's the danger yeah to be honest I

1083
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:06,558
don't know if if I you know how much

1084
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,720
I'll be worried about marijuana uh in a

1085
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,920
trump presidency given everything else

1086
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,799
so but now I'm I'm steering away from

1087
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,119
ncia scope I guess when I say that up

1088
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,240
here you you may become a heavy

1089
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,599
user well so in Arizona where I've been

1090
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,239
doing a lot of work the Democratic party

1091
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:24,920
is doing a lot of get out the vote work

1092
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:27,439
right now because it's turning out to be

1093
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,000
a swing state there are a lot of folks

1094
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,318
in the state who are Republican but

1095
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,800
there are also a lot who are very

1096
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,599
dissatisfied with Trump as an option so

1097
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,039
Hillary could end up saving the

1098
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:40,200
marijuana vote in Arizona but this is a

1099
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:43,400
real this is a very real question I mean

1100
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:46,799
what what if the crazies get their way

1101
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,358
and Trump H be gets elected um Chris

1102
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,079
Christie has made it well known that he

1103
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:55,598
is not um he doesn't see this issue the

1104
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:57,960
way we do so that that's that's a real

1105
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,960
concern

1106
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:03,519
well regardless of who you want to vote

1107
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,760
for president please go out and support

1108
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,519
these referenda and the jurisdictions in

1109
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,760
which you live and take your friends and

1110
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,639
take your family this year is so

1111
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,440
important for our

1112
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:18,039
industry okay I have one last question

1113
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,400
for you all um so I hate these

1114
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:22,960
prognostication questions because they

1115
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,920
assume some level of inevitability in

1116
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,358
forward progress but I am going to ask

1117
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:31,720
you to pregnant ostic a little bit um so

1118
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:34,358
say we do pass one or more of our five

1119
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:37,000
legalization initiatives in November so

1120
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:39,920
those are California Arizona Nevada

1121
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,318
Massachusetts and Maine so say

1122
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,599
California passes who knows about the

1123
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:49,558
others um all these municipalities in

1124
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:52,880
California and and probably elsewhere

1125
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:56,319
who raise as a as a reason for not

1126
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,000
moving forward the federal conflict

1127
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:01,279
excuse oh oh it's ferally illegal we

1128
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,960
can't do anything because we would be

1129
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,680
breaking federal

1130
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,720
law what do we see happening you know

1131
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:10,799
not just here in California but in

1132
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:12,439
States like Louisiana who probably would

1133
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,599
would throw out that excuse as a reason

1134
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,838
for not passing better marijuana laws

1135
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,838
what's

1136
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,598
ahead well I mean we're always going to

1137
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,679
hear that from some of the the you know

1138
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:26,200
backwards jurisdictions and you know

1139
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:28,519
places like California that's very

1140
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:31,399
diverse you know you've got some parts

1141
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:33,039
of the the state that are very red uh

1142
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,160
and the answer is let's work on fixing

1143
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:37,880
federal law and ending that conflict um

1144
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:39,838
but also if you're working in those

1145
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,720
jurisdictions you know what we what

1146
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:45,000
we're seeing is and we've see in

1147
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:47,318
Colorado Cal in California when you know

1148
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,960
neighboring jurisdictions are regulating

1149
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:53,000
cannabis cultivation and reaping the

1150
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,960
sales ta or the tax benefits from that

1151
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,239
uh and not seeing any increase in crime

1152
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,240
the the usually their Neighbors start

1153
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,639
coming around and and deciding that it's

1154
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,598
time to to allow you know allow

1155
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,879
cultivation or retail and so I think

1156
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,640
that it's you know economically it makes

1157
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:13,240
it just makes more sense uh for these

1158
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,358
these uh jurisdictions to come on board

1159
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:16,679
but I know that it's you know we've been

1160
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:20,159
working on it here in California for 20

1161
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:21,480
years now um but you know the answer is

1162
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:23,078
yeah we got it that's another reason we

1163
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,480
need to change federal law because a lot

1164
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:27,240
of the local problems even if with you

1165
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:30,079
know talking to your zoning commission

1166
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:32,838
your your city council at the you know

1167
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,839
very very local level are rooted in this

1168
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:36,639
Federal conflict and that's why we we

1169
00:47:34,838 --> 00:47:38,838
can't lose sight of of the need to keep

1170
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:40,799
pushing hard in

1171
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:42,838
Congress this relates to your earlier

1172
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,559
question actually right because

1173
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:46,039
federally our entire industry is built

1174
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:49,880
on a

1175
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:51,719
memo and a restriction on da being able

1176
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,400
to use funds to go after medical

1177
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:55,759
providers so we need real change on the

1178
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,280
federal level we've got to that point

1179
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,960
Point if's Let's play that scenario out

1180
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,920
and Chris Christie or whomever becomes

1181
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:08,838
the AG and the head of

1182
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:11,960
Justice uh the co memo is gone and that

1183
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:14,920
Pro all that is a prosecutorial guidance

1184
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:17,720
and it's over and now they're free to

1185
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:21,480
begin the raids what does that look like

1186
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:24,039
in Colorado where we have 29,000 badged

1187
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,639
employees in the industry as of last

1188
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:28,440
month what do you do what when when

1189
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,358
you're going to go and start rounding

1190
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,318
all the tens of thousands of people up

1191
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:33,838
hundreds of thousands of people

1192
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:35,639
throughout the country seizing all their

1193
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:38,480
funds destroying those jobs crashing

1194
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:40,519
local economies o o only after we're

1195
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,519
done with the

1196
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:46,119
immigrants the

1197
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:47,838
wall so but no look that's that's a joke

1198
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:49,119
but it's not a joke right that's that's

1199
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:54,880
what we're dealing with today it's

1200
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:57,880
insane so you know the the it it we need

1201
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,280
real Federal reform and it really it all

1202
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:03,039
comes down everyone you know everyone

1203
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:05,240
says it's Pie in the Sky no there's no

1204
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:07,838
appetite on the federal level right now

1205
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:09,279
for real 280 reform there's no appetite

1206
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:11,318
to remove marijuana from the control

1207
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,760
Substances Act the very first political

1208
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:14,480
campaign I was ever involved in with

1209
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,640
Jesse vur for governor of Minnesota in

1210
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,358
1998 there was no chance he could become

1211
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,118
governor of Minnesota there was no

1212
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:22,239
chance that rep that Donald Trump could

1213
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:25,200
become the Republican nominee last year

1214
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:28,598
there's no chance when in 2004 we went

1215
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:30,159
to Vermont uh with Gary Johnson and the

1216
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,760
governor of Vermont and the Speaker of

1217
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:34,159
the House told us you will never ever

1218
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,760
ever get a medical marijuana law passed

1219
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:37,159
as long as we're in this position and

1220
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,799
four months later we passed a medical

1221
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:40,679
marijuana law that the governor let go

1222
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:42,519
into law without his signature people

1223
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:44,159
keep saying it's impossible you can't do

1224
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:46,119
it you can't do it politically we have

1225
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:47,960
to ask for what we need not what we

1226
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:50,000
think we can

1227
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:53,079
get and what we need is to remove

1228
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,079
marijuana from the CSA

1229
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:59,119
entirely and I guess that's where I was

1230
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:03,559
headed with my question too is um state

1231
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:05,240
level progress is crucial to to achieve

1232
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:09,319
Federal level progress in fact that's

1233
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:11,118
MP's whole strategy is to make progress

1234
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:12,719
state by state by state and that builds

1235
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,519
the support in Congress like Erin was

1236
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:17,318
talking about earlier and that helps us

1237
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,000
make that Federal level

1238
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:21,480
change so I think I'm going to wrap it

1239
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
up right there unless we have more

1240
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,159
questions give you all a chance to hit

1241
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,079
the bathroom before the debate question

1242
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:32,318
oh one more

1243
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:35,160
question just for you thanks so um would

1244
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:38,079
an increase in state level product

1245
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:41,639
liability lawsuits have an impact on the

1246
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,640
fed's taste for

1247
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,960
reform I'm not sure they're directly

1248
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,519
connected to be honest with you as a

1249
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,920
business owner I can tell you I worry

1250
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:54,960
about that quite a bit uh but I'm not

1251
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,680
sure that the state's seeing more

1252
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,599
litigation around product safety or even

1253
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:02,719
enhanced state regulations is going to

1254
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,640
make a make too much of a

1255
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,719
difference yeah I don't I don't think

1256
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:09,078
that that's something that Congress is

1257
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:11,679
is concerned about right now um I mean I

1258
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:14,920
think what what what matters is that the

1259
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:17,279
state regulations are effective and that

1260
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,880
the the all of the the major actors in

1261
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,119
the states are following the

1262
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,400
regulations um and of you know sometimes

1263
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,480
we get them obviously we get them wrong

1264
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,720
sometimes and it takes you know time to

1265
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,240
improve uh and work at the state level

1266
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:32,399
but that isn't something that's that's

1267
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:35,598
really being looked at uh that that you

1268
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,599
know deeply as far as I can

1269
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:45,119
tell
