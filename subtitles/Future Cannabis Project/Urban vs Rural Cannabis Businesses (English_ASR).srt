1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,318
we talk a lot about you know sun-grown

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,000
versus indoor in terms of different

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,859
types of policies but I think we also

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,559
need to start talking about rural versus

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,349
urban and there's a whole set of

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:15,750
barriers for rural cannabis businesses

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,879
that urban cannabis businesses do not

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,640
have to deal with but yeah we are put up

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,710
against the same processes so things

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,469
like having things affixed to the ground

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,050
or having a DEA accessibility if you

12
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:30,239
have employees or having separate areas

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,210
for everything or having you know a

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,519
paved road to and from your facility if

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,829
you have employees there's a day every

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,540
day of the week exactly so I think we

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,000
can start thinking about that and maybe

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,850
next legislative session we need to come

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,619
with a bill that is specifically

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,859
addressing issues for rural cannabis

21
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,929
businesses and not just farmers just you

22
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,329
know manufacturers and retail and

23
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,429
anybody that has to exist in a rural

24
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,799
area where you don't have good internet

25
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,929
right and you and your micro businesses

26
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,250
can't all be on the same premise and no

27
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,228
one else does it that way and the

28
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,599
wineries grow grapes here and make wine

29
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:09,390
here and have a tasting room here and so

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,359
why are we being subject to a very urban

31
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,489
centered policy structure it's just not

32
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,709
fair to the people that are the legacy

33
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:19,408
producers in this industry was there any

34
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,089
kind of shift in the requirement for the

35
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,330
micro business and everything needed to

36
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,820
be at the same no there wasn't a shift

37
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:29,069
in that there was a shift in the number

38
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,798
of pricing tiers for almost all of the

39
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:35,099
licenses within the BCC everything from

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,430
testing labs to self distribution micro

41
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,809
businesses and also cannabis event

42
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,720
organizers I thought that was pretty

43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,670
fascinating but a couple of things that

44
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,408
I thought like speaking of rural farmers

45
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,200
I think about seasonal farmers right

46
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,109
we're in an urban area you are more

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,689
likely to have electricity or resources

48
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:57,239
available right that flat area that

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,908
allows you to maybe cultivate year-round

50
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,059
or develop in that manner row farmers

51
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,049
often have it

52
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:08,289
in that manner and so they're not those

53
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:10,689
kind of cultivators we still don't have

54
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:14,259
the ability to utilize light deprivation

55
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:16,209
in the outdoor tier and it seems like

56
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,669
that didn't happen either and it seems

57
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,250
like there's some concern about whether

58
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:23,559
or not if you're in a structure say like

59
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,050
a hoop house or a green house but you

60
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,000
don't use DEP tarps and you don't use

61
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,790
lighting it looks like you might get

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,549
forced into the ml1 tier in that

63
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:37,179
structure but then I also there was a

64
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:39,370
series of recent inspections and what

65
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,219
we've been told is if you are licensed

66
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:45,819
under the mix light one tear and you

67
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:49,299
have say I don't know nine thousand

68
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:51,939
square feet in white def hoops but a

69
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:53,950
thousand square feet of it is open air

70
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:55,629
for your 10,000 square feet of canopy

71
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:58,449
but those need to be two separate

72
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:01,568
licenses you can't cultivate your full

73
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:03,699
term outdoor crop under your ml1 license

74
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:06,819
and bundle those together I think that's

75
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:08,229
going to have exponential impact for

76
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,930
separate premises and separate

77
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:14,078
operations and separate license fees and

78
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,489
separate surety bonds scuffling that

79
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:17,920
came up and we were talking to the Board

80
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,920
of Supervisors in Mendocino and they

81
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:23,018
were not aware at all that you could not

82
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,699
be outdoor and have one license if you

83
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:26,620
for pulling a tarp or having a hoop

84
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,449
house people thought that they can have

85
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,280
10,000 square feet as long as you said

86
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:32,669
if you were mixed light that included

87
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,930
outdoor or mix light and you can

88
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:39,030
there one license right yeah challenging

89
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,900
what are we gonna do guess where you

90
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,900
have to go smoke pot

91
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:52,128
