00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:29,059
this is what should be a very lively

4
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:33,890
discussion on who's winning and who's

5
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:37,640
losing in the cannabis economic climate

Hezekiah referred to obliquely in the

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,390
last panel and I'll have a couple of

00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,739
focused on a tokenized to fund I'd like

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,180
to mention before we get started we

77
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,680
originally had two women prepared for

78
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,939
this panel they were unfortunately

79
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,340
unable to make it but I know that's

80
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:59,789
important in this industry and so we'll

81
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,219
have an all-male panel this time so last

82
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:06,090
month I part of the reason I was

83
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:08,099
selected for this panel as I sent a

84
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,270
social media post and I was asking to

85
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:15,060
speak relating to an article about with

86
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,460
companies who were thriving under the

87
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,689
medical marijuana model and who are now

88
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:24,689
struggling under legalization I posted

89
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:27,529
it to Instagram Facebook and Twitter and

90
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:30,839
I received 50 responses within the day

91
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:32,250
45 Facebook shares and it was to the

92
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,799
point where I had to set up a Google

93
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,540
Form and a survey to collect all the

94
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,370
information one of the things we'll be

95
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,990
doing here today is I'll be sharing some

96
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,740
of those stories as

97
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,290
we get into each topic one of the

98
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,439
replies I got was it shouldn't have to

99
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,900
be a fight to stay out of jail and keep

100
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:56,009
my own property and business but that's

101
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:58,969
how it is now I guess is the second time

102
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:01,740
offender within the span of two years

103
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:05,310
after legalization I'm looking at one

104
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,189
year in jail and I need to forfeit my

105
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,709
business in my property so at the same

106
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:14,129
time I'm getting it's on my email and

107
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:17,399
I'm listening on the radio and there's a

108
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:20,490
commercial selling register they say for

109
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,979
our online course find out everything

110
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,490
you need to know to make money in the

111
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,890
cannabis industry now I'm not going to

112
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:32,069
identify who actually put out that

113
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:36,199
commercial but they're on this boat and

114
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:39,300
they're on the next floor so that's the

115
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,490
dichotomy we have with what the promises

116
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,850
are around this industry and what the

117
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:48,269
reality is like to begin with Matt young

118
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:51,390
of a pod is the California cannabis

119
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:54,930
industry really a get rich scheme

120
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:56,789
anymore unfortunately not I'm in the

121
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,759
position to where I talked to

122
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,730
dispensaries every day brands every day

123
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:05,430
and sorry businesses every day and

124
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:10,220
unfortunately it gets harder and harder

125
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:14,910
to even survive let alone make money

126
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:18,370
raising capital is one issue but on top

127
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,509
of that with the dispensaries

128
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,509
is that is that better

129
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:27,408
okay sorry guys on the dispensary side

130
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:29,479
the regulations on the distribution side

131
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:34,639
there's testing issues packaging issues

132
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:36,560
on if you're a cultivator a manufacturer

133
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,120
you're moving into new buildings you're

134
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,848
buying new equipment you're moving into

135
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,780
new cities because unfortunately a lot

136
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:45,259
of the cities where they were located

137
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:46,609
before they are not issuing licenses and

138
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:49,098
they're having to upend their whole

139
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,900
business and even companies that are ten

140
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:54,228
years old that are very well-established

141
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:55,609
large companies are you know

142
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:59,899
experiencing growing beans to where

143
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:01,639
they're a 10 year old startup and no one

144
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:04,038
is getting rich right now but that's

145
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,590
okay you know the the cream will rise to

146
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:09,528
the top and everyone buckles down and

147
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:12,138
works hard and you know this is just the

148
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:14,778
very beginning of a very long journey

149
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:17,389
I think if I can add that if we look at

150
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:19,278
just American statistics in general so

151
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,500
eighty percent of companies survive

152
00:07:19,278 --> 00:07:23,060
their first year fifty percent of

153
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,620
companies are business within five years

154
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,629
and if you apply that tax you're

155
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,759
regulated businesses it's more twenty

156
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:30,349
percent actually survive so again it's

157
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,810
lack of capital collectively and

158
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:36,110
obviously this is intensified by limited

159
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,658
bank lending again a scarce both venture

160
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,460
prime an empty market is this today but

161
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,949
also just operations in regards to

162
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:44,538
regulated businesses so on top of if we

163
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:46,460
talked about California specifically

164
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:48,348
because of legislation moving at a bit

165
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:50,658
more slowly what's happening is that

166
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:52,278
other companies from other states or

167
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:54,829
other countries are also moving in and

168
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:56,149
they are also well capitalized so

169
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:58,278
therefore they're actually cannibalizing

170
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:00,258
somewhat because of see market so again

171
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,908
it's an evolution it's a large market

172
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,979
but it's definitely a longer play than a

173
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:07,899
shorter play but the 80/20 rule will

174
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:10,430
still be lickable most folks who are in

175
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:14,658
what they call the legacy market i guess

176
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:17,028
it's been referred to haven't really and

177
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:19,848
even the large capital coming in don't

178
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:22,158
understand the market trends and how

179
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:25,550
everything's moving towards biomass and

180
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:28,438
the incredible amount of fragmentation

181
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:32,908
and slices of the market

182
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:36,658
whether it's distilling winterizing all

183
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:39,649
the you know extraction all designed to

184
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:42,149
address this massive increase in

185
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:43,559
extracted products is what I call it

186
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,528
someone have may have a different

187
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,419
nomenclature so what I think and I've

188
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:51,659
seen this even with you know wealthy

189
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:54,028
capital folks coming in and even with my

190
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:55,679
cannabis guys you know Hezekiah and I

191
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:57,568
went you know go back to the humble

192
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,969
growers they don't really understand

193
00:08:57,568 --> 00:09:02,669
that and haven't caught up yet

194
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,610
to that real reality of where the

195
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:07,528
markets going and the individuals you

196
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,649
know I can segment out just in the

197
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:12,688
extraction industry probably seven or

198
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,490
eight different sub markets and people

199
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:16,528
aren't seeing that yet and I think

200
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,180
that's gonna make a huge difference in

201
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:20,188
the statistic which I agree with that

202
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,378
it's you know something like two-thirds

203
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:24,179
or three-quarters of folks are gonna go

204
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:29,159
out of business even if they had been in

205
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:32,938
business before so in North America

206
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:34,860
between the 2015 and 2017 roughly six

207
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:40,019
billion dollars was invested in the

208
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:42,329
cannabis area a lot of the money that I

209
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,549
see being made is not necessarily in the

210
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:47,609
plant touching sphere it's the picks and

211
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:49,919
shovels and so the greenhouse providers

212
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,289
the soil the nutrients those folks that

213
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,688
don't necessarily depend upon the plant

214
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:58,708
touching side of the of the industry and

215
00:09:54,688 --> 00:10:00,778
aren't subject to 280e taxation etc and

216
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:03,809
depending upon the risk profiles of the

217
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:06,269
investors there's there's been a large

218
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:08,729
amount of inflows on cultivation and

219
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:12,179
retail but there's also been a lot of

220
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,730
inflows on real estate and software and

221
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:17,789
so depending upon where the investors

222
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,139
minds are at the risk tolerance they're

223
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:21,269
going to either go with the plant

224
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:24,139
touching and go all-in or they're gonna

225
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:26,549
invest in the ancillary businesses

226
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:28,709
conversation we didn't really complete

227
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:31,919
is one on banking and that's that's why

228
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:33,869
it's a pleasure here to have tim schafer

229
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,179
with us the california deputy treasurer

230
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,629
public finance i want to share with

231
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:41,469
everyone what one company wrote me so

232
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:45,299
this is bloom box and

233
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:49,450
these these folks provide b2b software

234
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:50,889
as product as a service and they said

235
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,930
legalization didn't help us with

236
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:57,490
investment capital because there's no

237
00:10:52,929 --> 00:11:00,639
way to safely bank or insure these

238
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,580
investment funds smaller investors

239
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,889
cannot incur risk and larger v-type VC

240
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:10,030
type investors are still bound by

241
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:11,679
so-called vice clauses commonly embedded

242
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,819
in their partnership agreements that

243
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:18,129
prohibit even indirect investments in

244
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:21,780
federally scheduled substances is this

245
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:25,120
really instruct Lee a Schedule one issue

246
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:28,589
a complex question with an equally

247
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:35,620
complex answer let me start let me start

248
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:40,840
start here banking banking many

249
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:44,220
businesses is a question of a banker

250
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,570
being able to engage in reasonable risk

251
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,740
management let me give you an example

252
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:54,040
that has nothing to do with cannabis

253
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:58,779
many banks will refuse to open accounts

254
00:11:54,039 --> 00:12:03,929
for check cashing services for horse

255
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:11,699
racing tracks for payday auto lenders

256
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:18,089
for cardrooms why because often these

257
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:22,180
organizations can mask occult activities

258
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:25,330
which will create regulatory risk for

259
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:27,639
the bank so they avoid it now notice

260
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,379
that it's perfectly legal to be in the

261
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,110
cardroom business or to run a horse

262
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:34,200
racing track assuming you've got

263
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,440
licenses from your locality to do that

264
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,629
introduced the notion of cannabis a

265
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,590
federally scheduled truck and then the

266
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:47,289
problem begins to metastasize the

267
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:52,879
problem metastasizes in this way in my

268
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:56,659
view bankers are risk averse

269
00:12:52,879 --> 00:13:00,559
and if this is a risk management

270
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:04,250
business the default position can easily

271
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:07,369
become risk avoidance rather than risk

272
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:10,659
management if there is no clear pathway

273
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:14,029
to economics that would work that

274
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:16,639
introduces the next facet of the risk

275
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:20,649
and that is because there is this

276
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:26,620
growing wave in our nation to discuss

277
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:31,730
Canopus the fact that it may be d

278
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:33,470
scheduled scares the bank's why well

279
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,500
because they can set up an apparatus

280
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:39,230
that will require a great deal of

281
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,230
investment only to look up and discover

282
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:44,450
that we're now off scheduled one and

283
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,909
we're back in the same category as a

284
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,190
card room or a racetrack and so forth

285
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:52,699
and therein is I think one of the

286
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,830
Rubik's cubes that need to be solved one

287
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,800
of the things that I would encourage you

288
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:00,920
all to become familiar with hezekiah

289
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:03,049
mentioned this in the last panel is this

290
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:04,729
document right here I'm not going to

291
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:07,699
read it to you it's available in the

292
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,889
state treasurer's website the title of

293
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,590
it is banking access strategies for

294
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:14,689
cannabis related businesses and give you

295
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:19,250
just a few seconds of what the four

296
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:22,430
primary recommendations are first at

297
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:26,090
least for the here and now develop a

298
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:28,459
system that will accommodate the cash

299
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,860
industry rather than trying to force it

300
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,690
into the business figure out a way to

301
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,050
accommodate the cash industry a little

302
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,820
bit better than we're doing we call that

303
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:41,629
inside the office the armored car bus

304
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:43,640
route strategy number 38 bus run by

305
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:46,629
Brinks that makes a scheduled stop

306
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:49,519
everywhere and picks up currency to pay

307
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:55,129
taxes and fees to the state to the local

308
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:57,049
agencies number to develop a data portal

309
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:58,899
those of you who are familiar with the

310
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:03,939
Washington system

311
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:07,149
know that the cannabis control mechanism

312
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:10,480
in that state ar-ar-ar figuratively

313
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:14,350
speaking kind of bolted on the framework

314
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:19,300
that was used for liquor control number

315
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:22,750
three investigate the feasibility of

316
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:25,479
establishing a state backed financial

317
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:29,019
institution that would cater to or

318
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,750
accommodate the industry I hope I get

319
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:34,419
questions on that later and then finally

320
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:37,539
in this to me is the big one develop a

321
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:42,159
consortium of bankers regulators

322
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:43,959
cannabis industry folks the stakeholders

323
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:48,969
that were discussed in the last panel

324
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:52,930
that our medical customers put them

325
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:57,000
together in a group that will devote

326
00:15:52,929 --> 00:16:00,789
some energy and time to lobbying federal

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,429
legislators and federal regulators about

328
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:05,579
the evolving nature of it those are the

329
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:08,739
four things you'll see in the report and

330
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:12,490
we're underway with each of those for

331
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,960
now and I agree with Tim I think if I

332
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,120
can add a little perspective from the

333
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,730
bank side about a year and a half ago I

334
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,289
ran America's fastest growing bank for a

335
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,720
beer two three years we grew from not

336
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:25,209
1.9 billion over 13 billion that period

337
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,220
of time aggregating to pause is the most

338
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,440
difficult thing that's possible if you

339
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,200
take a look at it you've got to if you

340
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,760
have a perspective a asking for deposits

341
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,680
or giving a loan obviously asking for

342
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,450
deposits more challenging so we need to

343
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:41,669
take higher risk strategies that bald

344
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:44,020
eb-5 broker-dealer cash businesses the

345
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:44,740
regulators are spent approximately half

346
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:47,409
of the year

347
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,720
so about 150 business days in our

348
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:52,389
offices and again measuring and

349
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,910
analyzing our high-risk businesses banks

350
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:55,720
themselves can hold 25 percent typically

351
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:57,789
if it's well-run

352
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,670
of their collective deposit base in

353
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:02,860
high-risk and what that means is it's a

354
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:04,659
fight for what high risk deposits can

355
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,430
actually sit on that balance sheet so

356
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,769
with that comes in here and risk the Tim

357
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,759
mention so and again if you take a look

358
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,170
at the smaller banks that are

359
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,490
participating they're about 300 banks

360
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,079
across us right now that

361
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,779
actually actively engaging cannabis

362
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,220
business to actually have a kyc an ml

363
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:20,500
program and BSA program that facilitates

364
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,328
it actually costs tens of thousands of

365
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,920
dollars if not hundreds and on top of

366
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:25,629
that if you look at these smaller banks

367
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,220
they don't have the technology some of

368
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,260
the core processing solutions to

369
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,640
actually interpret and understand

370
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:32,529
exactly where that money is coming from

371
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,390
so that entire process on an ongoing

372
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:35,558
basis ends up costing hundreds of

373
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,270
thousands of dollars because you need

374
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:39,369
personnel and staff to actually manage

375
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:40,539
that as well so that's the main

376
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:42,909
challenge that they're having in to

377
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:45,099
Tim's point it is very challenging and

378
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,080
the natural mentality the banker can be

379
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:48,789
risk averse the other side's challenge

380
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:51,939
is the actual payment side so if we

381
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:53,589
think about Visa MasterCard AB in

382
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,269
basically is where all the transactions

383
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:57,579
pass through if you think of every

384
00:17:55,269 --> 00:18:00,039
hundred dollars it passes through AB in

385
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:01,569
only one dollar can actually be high

386
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,119
risk related and so by definition

387
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:05,589
cannabis is high risk so we also need to

388
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,269
come up with additional payment

389
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:09,009
mechanisms that will help evolve

390
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:12,220
industry so it's not only just a cash

391
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:16,058
business lately I've been saying that

392
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,950
we're we have two policies at play one

393
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:22,629
is to allow cannabis and the other is

394
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:25,630
prohibited and the it's impossible to

395
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,790
move forward unless one is gonna win and

396
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,410
so we're back to you have to organize

397
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:31,629
you you have to go to the legislature

398
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,690
the courts aren't gonna help you have to

399
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:37,540
actually force this issue and the

400
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:39,100
absurdity of the contradictions between

401
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:41,339
what is really happening and what the

402
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:44,109
population in this country wants and

403
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:46,990
ultimately Congress has to do something

404
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:48,879
about it that's my perspective I've gone

405
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,558
back and forth with Fiona and other

406
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,240
folks in the state government about a

407
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:55,480
bank and well it's a really wonderful

408
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,849
idea and I support it there's just too

409
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,950
many I think too many barriers because

410
00:18:57,849 --> 00:19:01,808
of federal prohibition to allow it so

411
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:05,259
until we get Congress to do something

412
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:07,058
and this is just an old song I feel kind

413
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:09,190
of stupid keep bringing it up but until

414
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:11,019
we you know get our Congress people to

415
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,259
actually do something about it and

416
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:16,480
organize effectively rather than the old

417
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:18,308
left-wing firing squad you know that

418
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,160
joke how does the left-wing firing squad

419
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:22,619
line up in a circle and so you know

420
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,259
everyone's gonna have to

421
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:27,089
how to organize and work together put

422
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:28,470
the egos aside and then we got to go to

423
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:32,879
Congress because that's where ultimately

424
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:35,549
I think this has to get fixed from

425
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,670
personal experience our companies we've

426
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:40,440
lost to bank accounts just this month

427
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:42,570
one of the reasons was we deposited more

428
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,850
than five thousand dollars per month

429
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:46,549
into the account which as a business

430
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:48,629
owner having five thousand dollars

431
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:50,339
deposited in cash it's not a lot of

432
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,040
money especially in a cash business and

433
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:55,500
the other was because even though we ran

434
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,720
on plant touching business we accept

435
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,269
money from plant touching businesses and

436
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,429
that account was subsequently shut down

437
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:04,079
and right now I'm gonna have to talk to

438
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:06,780
and find one of those three hundred

439
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,058
banks because I have tried to open new

440
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:11,399
bank accounts and we have to put our

441
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:15,210
website down our website mentions

442
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,620
cannabis and we have been unable so far

443
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,299
we've only tried this week but we've

444
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,219
been unable to open a new bank account

445
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:23,039
which is very discouraging especially

446
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,079
for someone who has to run a business so

447
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,190
we'll see you know what changes we can

448
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,399
man I've been have to read that report

449
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,890
too but hopefully these rules can change

450
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,320
quickly because it's it's that's one

451
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,270
more deterrent to running a cannabis

452
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,409
business on top of all of everything

453
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:44,910
else thanking is also a huge challenge

454
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:46,860
so I don't know if the banks and I hate

455
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,350
to put a wet blanket over everybody but

456
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:52,049
I don't think the banks have an

457
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:55,199
incentive in order to enter into this

458
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:56,639
space okay so sorry about that I don't

459
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,610
think that banks have an incentive to

460
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,320
enter into this space because they the

461
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:03,889
the way that they grow their revenues

462
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:06,839
through acquisitions of other banks and

463
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:09,690
so they don't want to jeopardize those

464
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:13,049
acquisitions by entering into cannabis

465
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:18,509
space so they're deferring and staying

466
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:18,990
away from that and now I'm from Portland

467
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:22,710
Oregon

468
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:25,289
so in Oregon we have two main credit

469
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,269
unions that provide banking services

470
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:28,678
checking and savings five hundred

471
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:30,960
dollars a month for a checking and

472
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:34,920
savings account and that's to cover the

473
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,700
costs but they only have 600 accounts

474
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,279
total and there's over

475
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,160
4,400 businesses in Oregon right now

476
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:44,500
that aren't cannabis related so that's

477
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,509
the that kind of draws a picture of or

478
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,059
paints a picture of just the extent of

479
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:50,890
how little banking is offered to the

480
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:54,869
cannabis industry right now let's talk

481
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:59,200
about taxes and costs so one of the

482
00:21:54,869 --> 00:22:01,119
replies that was shared with me fella

483
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,420
says I was on the board of Silicon

484
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:07,149
Valley Americans for safe access

485
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:10,269
San Jose imposed a tax which was a point

486
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:12,550
of contention but the real bad part was

487
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:14,920
not just a tax it was no licenses for

488
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:17,799
years and then an act an actual

489
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:22,380
crackdown and monopolies on 16

490
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:25,000
businesses just like BCC is doing now

491
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:28,450
how they evolved and how does that

492
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,380
monopoly come about the way that I look

493
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:35,370
at that taxation is is that taxation

494
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:38,230
really influences the amount of legal

495
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:41,139
participation in the system and if taxes

496
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,930
are too high then it dissuades people

497
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,030
from participating either from an

498
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:49,539
operator's perspective or a consumers

499
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:52,450
perspective and for example and I think

500
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:55,420
in Nevada City they had a $10 a square

501
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,950
foot tax on their operations so if

502
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,830
you're a twenty thousand and regardless

503
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:02,140
of if it's can appear or whatever so in

504
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:04,809
that sense if you're a 20,000 square

505
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,850
foot operation already you're paying two

506
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:08,799
hundred thousand dollars in taxes just

507
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:11,259
at the local level before you generate

508
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,690
any revenue before any and so that's

509
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:16,750
just it's basically and there was a

510
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,640
phrase that I heard here in California

511
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,880
it's called prohibition through

512
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,270
legalization and so and I that really

513
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,380
resonated with me because they say hey

514
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:28,869
yeah come on in

515
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:32,110
we want your tax money we're gonna tax

516
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:36,250
you until you can't operate and then

517
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:39,279
what good is it right so but consumers

518
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:43,089
and businesses are extremely price

519
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:45,339
sensitive and we've at new frontier data

520
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:47,769
we've developed models that showed just

521
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:50,019
how price sensitive consumers are and

522
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:50,519
what level of legal participation would

523
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:53,789
occur

524
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,799
at various tax levels we provided

525
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:58,859
testimony at the state legislature in

526
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:02,250
Sacramento on a tax reduction bill that

527
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:05,009
looked at a reduction from 15% to 11% so

528
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:08,640
fairly nominal reduction but it was

529
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:12,539
going to generate 168 million dollars in

530
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,700
additional retail sales 64,000 new

531
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:17,359
entrants consumers from the Elissa

532
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,130
market into legal market and

533
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:24,599
unfortunately that proposal was voted

534
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:27,480
down so not sure what solution I can

535
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:31,339
provide but it's very very compelling

536
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:36,029
that as consumers are price sensitive

537
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:39,689
policy makers need to adjust and develop

538
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:41,940
their tax policies accordingly you know

539
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,400
I mean that's a really good point and

540
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,009
and I think it goes back to what I

541
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,679
always see is that there are

542
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:51,900
contradictory policies at play and if

543
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,540
the government does not want consumption

544
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,300
for example mark Kleiman and some other

545
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:59,069
prominent policy makers are basically

546
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,500
you know that can Oregon how they want

547
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:03,990
it to limit you know the the amount

548
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,179
grown and so forth they don't want it so

549
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,910
they put a syntax on it and that's

550
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:11,370
really what we're seeing we're seeing

551
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:13,290
the government contradicting itself with

552
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:15,989
saying we want legalization but we

553
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:17,579
really don't and I think until that is

554
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:20,460
addressed and until there's really

555
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:23,009
policy goals that are clarified you're

556
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,640
going to see this I had a conversation

557
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:29,700
with Lori Ajax a few months ago and I

558
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,250
asked her you know where who's on your

559
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,650
staff doing policy like the Board of

560
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:37,289
Equalization for example has policy

561
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,910
people and she said well we do policy

562
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:41,399
ourselves we don't have a professional

563
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:44,009
policy maker and so to me that was a red

564
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:47,070
flag that that we're not really thinking

565
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:48,539
about policy were really you know

566
00:25:47,069 --> 00:25:50,159
sweeping it under the carpet

567
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,319
but everything's driven by policy

568
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,570
everything and so unless you have that

569
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,460
resolve which it's not it's a

570
00:25:54,569 --> 00:26:00,119
contradiction then we're going to be in

571
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,319
this mess so another side of the tax

572
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:04,469
issue is

573
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:06,689
leveling the playing field where legal

574
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,819
licensed businesses are forced to pay

575
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,309
all these licensing fees all of these

576
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:13,829
taxes and you have the the gray in the

577
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:17,369
black market that aren't contributing

578
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:19,740
anything to the taxes which is you know

579
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:21,359
another struggle to keep your legal

580
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,039
business alive and that's where

581
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,349
enforcement really has to come into play

582
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,920
- hopefully shut down the illegal

583
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:31,500
operations so it's easier for those

584
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,570
licensed businesses to stay open and

585
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,250
have a little play in field because

586
00:26:33,569 --> 00:26:37,319
right now it's it's really unfair and

587
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,089
hard for the dispensaries and hard for

588
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:40,950
the license brands to be able to compete

589
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:45,089
with companies that aren't paying

590
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:46,230
payroll taxes but you know it's 40

591
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:48,000
percent of your business plus you've got

592
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,759
to e2 EU which no one's brought up yet

593
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,130
which is totally unfair which the

594
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,930
government governor just rejected that

595
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,450
bill so there's a lot of things we got

596
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:59,880
to work on some of you know me you've

597
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:03,029
heard me speak before I'm by no means an

598
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,910
apologist for banks but the the banter

599
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:09,529
you just heard is really critical to the

600
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:13,610
banking discussion as well

601
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:18,119
bankers are creatures of analysis

602
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:21,329
without clear sightlines into financial

603
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:24,269
data they don't get comfortable with

604
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:27,240
risk one of the principal sightlines

605
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:31,639
into financial data for small businesses

606
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:35,940
are tax returns 280e

607
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:38,280
essentially shoves deductible expenses

608
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,700
into the background for federal purposes

609
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:47,250
making it more difficult for the banker

610
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:51,750
to assess his or her risk that remains a

611
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:54,960
problem that i think it is - this

612
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:57,660
observer is a bit nonsensical if what

613
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,259
you're trying to do is to achieve tax

614
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:04,410
compliance that's the second thing the

615
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:06,779
second thing is that remember that to a

616
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,670
bank and again know of none I'm not an

617
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:12,809
apologist for banks here I'm just trying

618
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:14,640
to keep myself centered on this - a bank

619
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:19,259
taking a deposit

620
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:23,009
that deposit is your asset it is the

621
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:27,690
bank's liability the bank's liability

622
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:32,039
has to be offset with an asset that will

623
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:39,350
earn more than what the deposit is

624
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:44,309
costing it if we insist on this bizarre

625
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:46,459
mechanism of forfeiture of asset

626
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:49,139
forfeiture on federally insured

627
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,079
institutions what have you forced the

628
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:55,110
bank to do you've forced the bank to

629
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:58,889
take deposits from the industry but not

630
00:28:55,109 --> 00:29:04,049
lend to the industry not lending to the

631
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:07,040
industry is a lower yield prospect so

632
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:09,869
you've now put the squeeze on the bank

633
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,029
again I'm not an apologist here I'm just

634
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:14,669
trying to report the balls and strikes

635
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:17,430
okay you've put the squeeze on the bank

636
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:20,490
at the very same time that some of our

637
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:23,160
tax policies have put the squeeze on the

638
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,509
industry that's struggling how to get to

639
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,340
the finish struggling to get to the

640
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:32,490
finish line Thanks just to size the

641
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:35,339
extent of 280e new frontier data

642
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,650
presented in the White House an analysis

643
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:39,929
of the 280e

644
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:43,140
looking at the entire US market over a

645
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:45,990
seven-year period cannabis businesses

646
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:49,500
pay approximately fourteen point six

647
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:51,000
billion dollars in additional taxes than

648
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,359
they would normally pay if they were

649
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,369
treated as a normal business the a

650
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,159
health policy adviser for a president

651
00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:02,750
Trump said why would I give up fourteen

652
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:05,550
point six billion dollars in revenue and

653
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,559
the response to that of course is well

654
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:09,419
look at all those jobs look at all the

655
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,519
conversion from the illicit market look

656
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,460
at all of the social issues that you

657
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:17,119
address by through this legalization and

658
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:21,090
so there's obviously a net benefit to

659
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:24,149
you know the 280 tax reform but it's

660
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:27,720
going to take a lot of Education and and

661
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:28,519
a lot of additional data in order for

662
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,259
them to be

663
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:35,179
instead of this just a quick point if I

664
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:36,858
start talking about 280e I'll go crazy

665
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:39,048
because I was the architect and the

666
00:30:36,858 --> 00:30:40,908
first guy who put the legal team

667
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:43,249
together to litigate the champ case in

668
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:45,619
the u.s. Tax Court so that's a whole

669
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:48,919
other issue that's going it hasn't even

670
00:30:45,618 --> 00:30:50,538
begun to rear its ugly head yet but what

671
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:52,549
I wanted to say was that I'm talking to

672
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:55,729
people and in seeing some stirrings of

673
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:59,209
trying to get local cities or counties

674
00:30:55,729 --> 00:31:00,919
to actually have citizens advocate to

675
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:02,389
have no taxes in those cities or

676
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:04,579
counties and I think that's going to

677
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:06,618
catch on if everyone can start to talk

678
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:08,298
in their communities about not imposing

679
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:10,308
taxes because you've already got the

680
00:31:08,298 --> 00:31:12,019
retail sales tax in California anywhere

681
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:15,200
from seven and a half to nine and a half

682
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:18,739
percent plus the 15% state excise tax

683
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,719
that's 22 to 25 percent right there so

684
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:22,848
you don't need any more taxes at the

685
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:24,440
local level and you can always impose

686
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:26,509
them later if things start crack

687
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,739
cranking up so I think from an

688
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,659
organizing point of view and that's

689
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:31,578
often how I look at this as a political

690
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:34,009
organizing matter I think you have to go

691
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:35,868
to your small the City Council's and the

692
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:38,479
county boards of Supervisors and say

693
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:40,578
look and you'd be surprised how many

694
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,440
people don't go to these meetings or

695
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:44,658
don't meet with legislators but if you

696
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,088
go and say look you're gonna kill this

697
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:49,278
industry and you're gonna port your goal

698
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:50,989
of ending the black market so why don't

699
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,999
you look at the data the kind of data

700
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:54,588
that you're you're talking about so I

701
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:56,749
would encourage everyone to think about

702
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:59,118
finding a community maybe like Berkeley

703
00:31:56,749 --> 00:32:01,429
like Dale details Berkeley that's

704
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:03,199
actually did just reduce their taxes

705
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:06,200
from was it ten to five percent or

706
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,838
something like that so and and and

707
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,019
continue to sort of push on that issue

708
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:14,690
so that would be my my two cents on that

709
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:16,429
moving on to licensing so here was a

710
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:19,099
comment that came to me I started down a

711
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:21,919
path to getting a distributor license in

712
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:25,548
San Francisco and I found insurmountable

713
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,649
obstacles at every turn when I was

714
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:30,648
unable to find a location suitable in

715
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:32,569
the minut areas available within San

716
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:36,348
Francisco where my activity was zoned

717
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:39,019
correctly the city asked me nicely to

718
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:41,629
shut my business down I did it was hard

719
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:46,099
I let my five employees go

720
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:48,620
and I cried a bunch eight of ten brands

721
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:52,159
I was representing last year no longer

722
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:54,619
exists in the legal market the people

723
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,560
behind those brands are like family to

724
00:32:54,619 --> 00:33:00,559
me and they lost their livelihoods over

725
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:03,919
these new laws how far off course that

726
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,409
we become I think we're seeing it in

727
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:09,080
some of our portfolio activity it almost

728
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,310
becomes a competitive advantage to have

729
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:12,199
teams that specialize in getting

730
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:14,149
licenses so you're basically putting

731
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,830
together consultants bankers

732
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,050
professionals that specialize in those

733
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:19,730
various licenses so it's almost an

734
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:21,019
unfair competitive and regards to how

735
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,069
we're going about it and then it goes

736
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:25,190
back to what I originally mentioned

737
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:28,059
we're doing is leveraging companies from

738
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,170
other states other countries to actually

739
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:31,759
import their businesses in the state

740
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,960
they've got proven business models which

741
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,579
is part of the credibility that you need

742
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,400
and then they have the existing capital

743
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:39,379
so unfortunately the lack of speed at

744
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,180
this moment or the tardiness assemble

745
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,800
this licensing Negley affects the

746
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,150
California businesses specifically but

747
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,309
creates advantages for some of the out

748
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:48,530
save competition and the other part here

749
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:50,480
is where we were going after multiple

750
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:52,160
international licenses and what we are

751
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,200
seeing is it is an educational process

752
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,460
but the period appears to be somewhat

753
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:02,960
shorter than what we're seeing in

754
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:04,309
California at this point in time so from

755
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,360
a policy perspective it's really

756
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:13,869
difficult to balance the market versus

757
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:17,539
the free market in Oregon for example

758
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:18,949
there's one cultivation license for

759
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:22,070
every five hundred thousand dollars of

760
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:24,500
the total addressable market the total

761
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:26,809
revenue in the entire market whereas in

762
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,750
Florida that in an area where they have

763
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:31,340
limited licensure that's one license for

764
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:36,469
every hundred twenty-five million

765
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:38,860
dollars and so the concept here is it's

766
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:42,799
difficult for policy makers to balance

767
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:45,710
what's the sweet spot there's data out

768
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,840
there they just haven't asked for it

769
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:51,320
they haven't it hasn't resonated with

770
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,450
them because you know in such states as

771
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,079
Oregon and Washington you have super

772
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:58,018
saturation of supply

773
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:00,028
you have declining values declining

774
00:34:58,018 --> 00:35:02,368
revenues and then people go out of

775
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:05,248
business and compounded with 280e

776
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:07,079
compounded with the lack of banking then

777
00:35:05,248 --> 00:35:10,379
that's a tough nut to crack

778
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:12,568
because you know people are that's real

779
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,519
wealth that because friends and families

780
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:17,538
are the people that need to invest in

781
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:20,008
this so if you don't set it up correctly

782
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:23,009
then you have a chance to wipe out

783
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:26,219
individuals wealth you know to a to a

784
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:27,869
massive extent so that that's the tough

785
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:34,048
nut to crack right now and nobody's

786
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:35,670
really dialed it in quite yet so that's

787
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:38,458
another thing to talk about is wiping

788
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:42,170
out your wealth which I've experienced a

789
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:44,518
couple times and I can abyss career and

790
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:48,358
that's why I had to start a pop and not

791
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:51,208
touch this plant anymore but starting

792
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:52,949
over at zero is tough and when you look

793
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:55,558
at like the social equity programs that

794
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:57,449
they're trying to start this business

795
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:58,680
takes millions of dollars to do if you

796
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,848
don't have millions of dollars you've

797
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:02,728
got a team up with people that have

798
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:04,199
millions of dollars and there's

799
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:05,489
companies I've talked to on the social

800
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:07,559
equity side and it seems like they're

801
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:08,429
kind of taking advantage you know these

802
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:10,859
people have already been beat down

803
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:13,768
they've already lost everything and now

804
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:15,958
companies are going to use their you

805
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:18,419
know experience and and their arrests

806
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:20,129
and their financial ruin for their own

807
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,249
personal gains so that's another thing

808
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,920
that this the licensing it's just

809
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:27,748
another turrent for you know the regular

810
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,170
guy everyone wants to be a part of this

811
00:36:27,748 --> 00:36:32,968
industry and that regular person who has

812
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,009
all this experience who loves the plant

813
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:37,259
loves the industry you know he's got an

814
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:40,829
uphill battle to to try and really

815
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:44,130
participate and succeed so hopefully you

816
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:45,839
know events like this can get people

817
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,910
educated get people to meet other people

818
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:50,400
you know that can help them raising

819
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:52,048
capital help them get licensed all those

820
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,389
kind of things and you know hopefully it

821
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:57,119
grows from there you know this industry

822
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:58,949
in essence is 9 and 9 months old so

823
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,778
we're at the start of something great

824
00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:03,930
and hopefully it gets better and better

825
00:37:00,778 --> 00:37:06,260
in nascent markets like this it's

826
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:08,569
natural to have a lot of actors

827
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:13,520
come in at the beginning everybody's

828
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:16,610
excited there is a passion but just

829
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:20,449
naturally these markets consolidate and

830
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:22,370
so my advice to you as small businesses

831
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:25,519
now policy makers want to protect small

832
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:27,079
business while also allowing for growth

833
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:31,789
and development and consolidation in the

834
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:36,829
market but my advice to operators here

835
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:40,489
is be sure to do your due diligence be

836
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:43,400
sure to have an exit strategy talk to

837
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:46,279
people and if you want to compete with

838
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:49,340
the big guys then develop some type of

839
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:52,700
consortiums or business you know

840
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:57,640
affiliations or groups collaborations

841
00:37:52,699 --> 00:38:00,619
with others so that you can compete or

842
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:05,299
realize just where your cost structure

843
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:06,769
is and and plan accordingly so that you

844
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,810
develop and carve out your own niche

845
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:11,719
because if you don't you'll just be

846
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:14,059
consumed and wiped out just like a lot

847
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:16,549
of the small businesses out there right

848
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:20,029
now I'm going to whine for one second

849
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:24,530
that both the industry and the

850
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:26,390
government and the consumers are not

851
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,160
doing enough to make the changes that

852
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:30,349
need to happen because everybody's

853
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,420
retreating to their corner and trying to

854
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,909
scrap it up themselves and so unless you

855
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,380
know what did Franklin say you know if

856
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:38,539
we don't all hang together we're gonna

857
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,970
hang separately and I can't keep

858
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:42,889
emphasizing that enough and that

859
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:45,399
actually means that you have to talk to

860
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:47,629
people and communicate and organize

861
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,789
because otherwise you're just gonna back

862
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,619
back right into this legal concept that

863
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:53,750
I keep explaining to everybody called

864
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:55,429
clusterfuck and that's that's

865
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,949
essentially what what's going to keep

866
00:38:55,429 --> 00:38:59,659
happening unless you guys do something

867
00:38:57,949 --> 00:39:02,719
about it there's leadership in this

868
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:04,730
movement I'd like to refer to myself as

869
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:07,339
a general the rebel forces and the war

870
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,990
on drugs but it's you need a lot more

871
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,880
you need the people to actually stand up

872
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:13,869
you got to do more and that's always

873
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,869
going to be my message

874
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:20,969
I'm not going to be an apologist for the

875
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:24,989
banks I keep repeating that because I'm

876
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:27,059
really not many of our small banks let's

877
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:30,119
let's focus on some numbers because I

878
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:32,130
think what Matt is just described is a

879
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:36,209
sliver and the door that you can stick

880
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:38,338
your foot in as we sit here today there

881
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:43,169
are roughly a hundred and sixty five

882
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:48,048
banks in California that's down from

883
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:50,789
about 225 just nine years ago

884
00:39:48,048 --> 00:39:52,949
consolidation is an inevitable part of

885
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:55,859
the banking business as well so let's

886
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:58,079
think about how little banks start

887
00:39:55,858 --> 00:40:00,719
little banks start with an

888
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,989
entrepreneurial instinct and I'll bet

889
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:06,499
that sounds familiar to most of you that

890
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:09,329
entrepreneurial instinct brings together

891
00:40:06,498 --> 00:40:11,788
local business people who say hey I've

892
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:15,900
got a great idea why don't we start a

893
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:18,689
bank then their journey begins also

894
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,789
where they're subject to regulation this

895
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:23,879
is not a request for your sympathy

896
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:26,369
instead I'm asking for empathy if we

897
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,949
understand where the other folks are

898
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:32,160
coming from it makes our problem easier

899
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:35,068
to solve because we can we can engage in

900
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,748
more productive dialogue so the small

901
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:38,699
business people come together and they

902
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:41,129
form a bank what's the first thing the

903
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:43,469
regulator says to them you can't grow

904
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:45,630
too fast you can't make certain kinds of

905
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:48,269
loans you can't engage in certain types

906
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,219
of business that regulator keeps that

907
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:53,909
group of business people on a very short

908
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:56,458
leash until it can be satisfied that

909
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:59,219
that new little bank doesn't represent a

910
00:40:56,458 --> 00:41:03,598
contagion point for the larger banking

911
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:07,079
system if in fact a regulator shows up

912
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,959
says uh it looks to me like you may be

913
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:12,599
banking a marijuana business who are the

914
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:15,419
people who are directly impacted by that

915
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:18,119
the original shareholders guess who the

916
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:20,849
directors of that little bank are the

917
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,789
original shareholders so you can see how

918
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:27,460
the problem becomes cyclical here's what

919
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:30,339
I would offer up for your just to ponder

920
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:33,460
when we conducted one of our public

921
00:41:30,338 --> 00:41:36,009
hearings up in Santa Rosa I heard from a

922
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:40,960
very passionate member of the industry

923
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:45,309
the cannabis industry say I can't even

924
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,800
go into my local community bank and sit

925
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:50,380
with a senior executive of the local

926
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,160
community bank and have a conversation

927
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,240
about my business class what's wrong

928
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,929
with that picture

929
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:01,348
okay that entrepreneur wasn't asking for

930
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:03,940
a loan wasn't asking for a deposit

931
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:06,130
relationship that entrepreneur was

932
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,990
asking for the expertise of that local

933
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,940
banker so I've had this same

934
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:13,808
conversation that have just had with you

935
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:16,690
with local bankers okay because if we

936
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:19,690
stop retreating to our corners as

937
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:22,510
matters describe and understand that

938
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:25,119
small business flourishes in the banking

939
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:27,130
sector the same way small business will

940
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,039
flourish in your sector and it's only by

941
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:34,420
talking to one another effectively that

942
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:36,429
we're gonna make some progress Tim would

943
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,139
you like to explain the set of visual

944
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:45,399
aids you've brought here I'm sure others

945
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:47,048
are curious do I I flashed this one

946
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,030
around this is available on the state

947
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:52,358
treasurer's website I would encourage

948
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:56,019
you to review it I will tell you having

949
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:59,949
worked for John Chun as his employee for

950
00:42:56,019 --> 00:43:02,230
the last five plus five years and as his

951
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:05,048
consultant for seven years before that

952
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:07,389
this is not somebody who writes reports

953
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:09,489
and files them away this is our

954
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:12,039
blueprint I brought a fresh copy the one

955
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:13,929
on my desk I promise you as dog-eared

956
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:17,769
who's got lots of little yellow stickies

957
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:19,629
on it this is an important road map for

958
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:21,460
the hard work that will have to be done

959
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:25,809
I'm not going to make any apologies it

960
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:29,710
is hard work sure the second thing that

961
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:32,349
you boy that doesn't last that one went

962
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:35,380
fast didn't it the second thing I would

963
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:38,410
want to encourage you all to pay

964
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,500
attention to is there are a number of

965
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:42,319
jurisdiction

966
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:46,250
in the united states that have examined

967
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:48,590
the feasibility of creating a public

968
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:50,179
bank that for the moment that has

969
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:52,130
nothing to do with your business but

970
00:43:50,179 --> 00:43:55,909
stay with me for a few seconds and i'll

971
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:58,220
bring them together this is has been

972
00:43:55,909 --> 00:44:01,879
resurrected as a result of the Occupy

973
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:07,129
movement after the financial crisis in

974
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:10,309
2008 2009 people in small businesses and

975
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:14,300
and and many communities in California

976
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:17,029
felt that big Wall Street had abandoned

977
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:21,220
them and so the call went out to have

978
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:24,550
the state or in some cases a locality

979
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:29,149
get into the business of owning a bank

980
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:32,630
the model typically held up as a paragon

981
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:34,700
of success is the Bank of North Dakota

982
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,430
I might ant which is owned by the state

983
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:39,619
of North Dakota I might add to temper

984
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:41,719
your enthusiasm the Bank of North Dakota

985
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:44,480
is the only publicly owned bank in the

986
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:48,199
United States and it was formed ninety

987
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,679
nine years ago okay so that's not to say

988
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:55,119
you should be discouraged now inevitably

989
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:59,649
inevitably after we legalized cannabis

990
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:05,659
two and a half years ago two years ago

991
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:07,670
the the public bank movement merged for

992
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:10,849
a little while with the cannabis banking

993
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:13,369
route that just made things worse in

994
00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:15,949
some jurisdictions but that doesn't mean

995
00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:18,139
it's going to be worse forever so if you

996
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:23,049
are from various parts of the state

997
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:27,259
Santa Rosa or you are in Richmond

998
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:31,550
Berkeley Albany Oakland and Alameda

999
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:36,260
County each of those areas is looking

1000
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:38,360
into this public bank idea the City and

1001
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:41,240
County of San Francisco is looking on it

1002
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:43,579
I service the treasurer's delegate to

1003
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:46,639
the task force to the San Francisco

1004
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:47,599
supervisors on this the state itself is

1005
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:50,929
looking into it

1006
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,900
although ours here's the merger ours is

1007
00:45:50,929 --> 00:45:54,899
focus

1008
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,999
on standing up a bank that would engage

1009
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,309
in the cannabis business now that

1010
00:45:56,998 --> 00:46:01,108
doesn't necessarily mean they bank the

1011
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:04,140
way you and I know a bank it may be a

1012
00:46:01,108 --> 00:46:09,659
payment system maybe a credit union it's

1013
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:13,710
still it's still being studied SB 930

1014
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:17,548
I Sen etre Hertzberg at the request of

1015
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:21,630
candidate for treasurer Fiona mah full

1016
00:46:17,548 --> 00:46:24,358
disclosure I'm not campaigning here was

1017
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:27,180
introduced into the Senate last year was

1018
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:32,338
passed out of the Senate by not a mature

1019
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:35,368
not a unanimously but very close and got

1020
00:46:32,338 --> 00:46:38,099
to the second house and died in its

1021
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:40,499
Appropriations Committee I expect that

1022
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:42,390
we will see that back again the

1023
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:45,118
difference is that we will have

1024
00:46:42,389 --> 00:46:48,659
completed the study that's recommended

1025
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,940
in here about how to do that that may

1026
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:53,038
inform the legislature in the next

1027
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:55,079
legislative session beginning in January

1028
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,789
with all the respect to my esteemed

1029
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:58,950
colleague the private banks in the state

1030
00:46:56,789 --> 00:47:01,680
will allow a public bank over there dead

1031
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:06,028
banking bodies okay that's my

1032
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:08,669
perspective on it thank you all for a

1033
00:47:06,028 --> 00:47:12,268
great panel I have a fun tax question if

1034
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:14,430
that can even happen but so Mac you mean

1035
00:47:12,268 --> 00:47:18,778
you represent a new client that was a

1036
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:20,098
licensed transporter that I had $230,000

1037
00:47:18,778 --> 00:47:24,150
seized by the Department of Homeland

1038
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:26,220
Security this is the first seized by the

1039
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:28,889
CHP and turned over to the Department of

1040
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:32,488
Homeland Security since this technically

1041
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:34,288
is the first shot across the bow against

1042
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:37,230
the license industry by the federal

1043
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:39,299
government I am curious does that

1044
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,739
licensed operator owed taxes on that

1045
00:47:39,298 --> 00:47:42,568
money or are we gonna wait until a

1046
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:46,050
settlement is reached before that's

1047
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:49,349
determined hell if I know

1048
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:51,480
you know first of all that should i take

1049
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:56,759
two minutes to tell the story or do you

1050
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:59,309
want to hear about what's going on this

1051
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:02,580
this is a great case that we're going to

1052
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:08,099
use to smash open the contradiction so

1053
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:11,039
keep following it support us the chp did

1054
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:13,799
stop my clients first for a mud flap

1055
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,449
violation on their pickup truck then let

1056
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,900
him go and then they followed him up the

1057
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:22,019
road stopped him again because it turned

1058
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:25,230
out that the chp had it in for my

1059
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:27,630
clients who had both been in the CHP and

1060
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:31,199
had left the CHP one of the clients had

1061
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:33,119
been fired from the CHP he got

1062
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,039
reinstated and then he resigned the

1063
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,230
other one was accused of stealing from a

1064
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,119
locker room at the CHP he was actually

1065
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:41,400
charged criminally and the jury did not

1066
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:45,239
find him guilty and he is therefore

1067
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,829
innocent but the CHP terminated him for

1068
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:49,169
insubordination because he wouldn't tell

1069
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:50,670
them what happened upon his advice of

1070
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,289
his lawyer during that criminal

1071
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,240
proceeding so he was fired for

1072
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:56,489
insubordination those are my guys so

1073
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,739
when you hear all the press stuff about

1074
00:48:56,489 --> 00:49:00,299
how dirty my guys are just remember that

1075
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:02,759
these were guys who were just doing

1076
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:05,250
their job and neither of them you know

1077
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:08,460
were I mean there was a real story

1078
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:10,230
behind who they were what happened was

1079
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:13,199
once they were stopped on the second

1080
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:16,740
stop they were treated like animals by

1081
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:19,799
the CHP officers they were taken to the

1082
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:23,429
Merced CHP station

1083
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:25,140
the CHP called the Fresno office of the

1084
00:49:23,429 --> 00:49:28,319
United States Citizenship and

1085
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:30,389
Immigration Services had an officer from

1086
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,670
that office in Fresno come up to Merced

1087
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:33,719
and take the two hundred thirty thousand

1088
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,059
dollars into custody

1089
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:37,859
this was a clear workaround to the

1090
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:39,929
robber core bloom and our amendment for

1091
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:43,650
those who don't know federal law that

1092
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:46,679
prohibits the Department of Justice from

1093
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,930
spending money on cannabis interdiction

1094
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:50,759
in medical cannabis states that

1095
00:49:48,929 --> 00:49:53,759
Department the Department of Homeland

1096
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:55,650
Security has a separate budget so isn't

1097
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,039
that tricky the federal government has

1098
00:49:55,650 --> 00:50:01,469
shown us what they're doing now when the

1099
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,630
when we challenge and I just will be

1100
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:04,739
filing forfeiture administrative claims

1101
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,028
and so forth and we're gonna be

1102
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:07,798
challenging that in federal court in the

1103
00:50:06,028 --> 00:50:09,179
Eastern District when the Eastern

1104
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:10,559
District forfeiture attorney for the

1105
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:12,328
United States attorney walks in the

1106
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,430
courtroom guess when I'm gonna tell the

1107
00:50:12,329 --> 00:50:16,079
judge he can't be here because your

1108
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:18,719
budget his budget doesn't allow him to

1109
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,880
be here so I've spoken to a couple of

1110
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,528
other attorneys notably Eric Shevin I

1111
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,269
haven't gotten a lot of details from him

1112
00:50:22,528 --> 00:50:26,728
but we know this is a trend they're

1113
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:28,828
gonna take the money and give it to DHS

1114
00:50:26,728 --> 00:50:31,679
as a workaround around Roy Parker blue

1115
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:34,798
man our that should really really make

1116
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:37,108
everybody stand up and shout and I hope

1117
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:38,818
everybody will do that and that's the

1118
00:50:37,108 --> 00:50:40,978
basic story we're gonna be filing all

1119
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:42,929
sorts of actions I'm already talking to

1120
00:50:40,978 --> 00:50:44,848
you know clients around the state we're

1121
00:50:42,929 --> 00:50:47,190
gonna mark Wasserman and his brother

1122
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:50,579
Craig where are you guys raise your

1123
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:52,889
hands my co-counsel we're going to be

1124
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:54,539
creating a huge stir about this we're

1125
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:56,009
gonna be getting attorneys I want to get

1126
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:58,019
an attorney from every county in the

1127
00:50:56,009 --> 00:50:59,998
state to be on the pleadings we're gonna

1128
00:50:58,018 --> 00:51:03,598
get a class-action injunction against

1129
00:50:59,998 --> 00:51:05,728
the CHP and then oh yeah

1130
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,130
and then when we're then when this thing

1131
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:10,108
is revealed for its absurdity then the

1132
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:12,660
legislature will hopefully fix this

1133
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:15,389
because this is all about a legislative

1134
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:18,659
fix the courts are gonna just follow the

1135
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:20,608
law call balls and strikes you know and

1136
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:22,469
so forth they're not going to give us

1137
00:51:20,608 --> 00:51:24,598
anything they really haven't and they

1138
00:51:22,469 --> 00:51:27,389
they don't plan on it that's not where

1139
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:28,619
you go it's in the legislative arena so

1140
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:31,469
that's what's gonna happen

1141
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:33,509
keep-keep wallet follow us there's gonna

1142
00:51:31,469 --> 00:51:36,920
be lots of stories about this don't

1143
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:39,509
believe a goddamn word the CHP is saying

1144
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,809
my name is Etienne font and I'm with

1145
00:51:39,509 --> 00:51:45,170
Berkeley patient's group we turn 19 next

1146
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:45,170
month

1147
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:51,019
we've unfortunately been kicked out of

1148
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:53,450
over 30 different banks and we've heard

1149
00:51:51,018 --> 00:51:56,179
this discussion of banks coming along

1150
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:57,889
and it's actually gonna happen is it can

1151
00:51:56,179 --> 00:52:02,358
unfortunately take a worst-case scenario

1152
00:51:57,889 --> 00:52:04,940
where a distributor or owner is murdered

1153
00:52:02,358 --> 00:52:07,759
before there is actual action taken

1154
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:09,789
place at the state / federal level I

1155
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:11,838
would hate to think that but

1156
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:13,789
unfortunately these are the realities we

1157
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:16,369
face every day when we're having to move

1158
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:19,309
large sums of cash Berkeley patients

1159
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:21,259
group has been a stalwart member of the

1160
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:24,230
community and particularly of the reform

1161
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:27,309
community and my hats off to you I had a

1162
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:30,798
client that was bringing cannabis to a

1163
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:33,769
cannabis retail operation was there was

1164
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:36,079
so incriminate out the operation

1165
00:52:33,768 --> 00:52:38,268
followed him and then beat the crap out

1166
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,160
of him so it's lucky that he wasn't

1167
00:52:38,268 --> 00:52:42,018
murdered but I think these sorts of

1168
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:44,480
things are going on but people are

1169
00:52:42,018 --> 00:52:47,118
afraid to report them and so that's part

1170
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,829
of why we don't get more action because

1171
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:56,390
people don't realize the severity of the

1172
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:56,930
problem so prior to joining new frontier

1173
00:52:56,389 --> 00:52:58,909
data

1174
00:52:56,929 --> 00:53:04,009
I was the chief operations officer at

1175
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:06,578
golden leaf holdings in Oregon some of

1176
00:53:04,009 --> 00:53:08,798
my co-workers didn't show up one day

1177
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:12,200
because their best friend was murdered

1178
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:19,730
he had his head blown off for $40,000

1179
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:22,608
and so to me on a personal basis I don't

1180
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:25,730
people are already being murdered for

1181
00:53:22,608 --> 00:53:28,730
and so it's and I agree with you people

1182
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:30,889
don't necessarily talk about it so I

1183
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:33,349
don't know if that's gonna be what puts

1184
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:36,920
the whole banking issue over the top

1185
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:39,798
it's gonna be something else probably

1186
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:43,009
just the scale on economics rather than

1187
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:45,440
the humanity I'm Dale derringer I

1188
00:53:43,009 --> 00:53:47,150
represent California normal national

1189
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,730
organization for reform of marijuana

1190
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:54,559
laws we are

1191
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:57,260
a non-profit 501 C 4 I've never been in

1192
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,170
the business of course at Worrell also

1193
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:02,210
probably the oldest marijuana

1194
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:04,159
organization in the state going back and

1195
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:10,280
we've had a bank account with no

1196
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:13,129
problems I must say since 1974 but we

1197
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,970
started we did encounter a glitch about

1198
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:18,200
ten years ago when we started listing

1199
00:54:15,969 --> 00:54:20,500
dispensaries and we tried to get a

1200
00:54:18,199 --> 00:54:22,939
PayPal account so people could pay

1201
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,469
dispensaries who walk or collectives

1202
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:27,440
actually they were patient collectives

1203
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:31,159
who wanted to get listed online could

1204
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,230
pay by PayPal and PayPal said hey we're

1205
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:34,759
terminating your account because you're

1206
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:37,429
dealing with these things that are

1207
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,170
federally illegal so we said oh well you

1208
00:54:37,429 --> 00:54:42,019
know you do have a point there they are

1209
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:45,349
illegal we'll stop doing business with

1210
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:49,280
those people ah but we continued to list

1211
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:51,319
doctors now doctors are legal and

1212
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,710
there's a federal court decision even

1213
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:58,789
saying so they got wind of that and they

1214
00:54:54,710 --> 00:55:02,869
terminated our services altogether then

1215
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:07,340
more recently we've started to hear a

1216
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:10,789
spate of nonprofits like other normal

1217
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:14,180
chapters like doctors organizations like

1218
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:17,210
the Alameda County Democrats a brownie

1219
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:21,139
Mary Democrats who have not been able to

1220
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:23,990
get banking services five-o again all

1221
00:55:21,139 --> 00:55:27,409
nonprofits this is new is there

1222
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:29,509
something happening there amongst the

1223
00:55:27,409 --> 00:55:32,389
regulators and wash it is there some new

1224
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:35,780
rule or something why has this started

1225
00:55:32,389 --> 00:55:38,389
to happen after all of these years Dale

1226
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:40,880
I think this working committee out of

1227
00:55:38,389 --> 00:55:42,559
the the prohibitionists and the White

1228
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,950
House and the Office of National Drug

1229
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,599
Control Policy have a multi-faceted

1230
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:51,529
targeted campaign going on right now

1231
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:54,199
one is the transferring assets to DHS or

1232
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:56,810
other agencies that can take the asset

1233
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:57,799
it's it's it's obviously a stupid play

1234
00:55:56,809 --> 00:55:59,630
because we're going to beat them in

1235
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,160
federal court when the US attorneys come

1236
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:04,440
in but there's that's a part

1237
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:07,170
it as well I think you also you see this

1238
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,300
massive tax auditing that's going on in

1239
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:10,559
Colorado if you haven't you know wait

1240
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,970
you know with all the problems we have

1241
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,159
here in California wait of the IRS

1242
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:15,779
starts auditing your businesses there's

1243
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:17,399
gonna get the licenses from the state

1244
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,140
and they're gonna start auditing at a

1245
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,090
much higher rate than they do for small

1246
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:22,619
businesses generally like we saw like we

1247
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:24,660
see and my colleague Rachel Jillette

1248
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:25,889
some you know or in Colorado I talk to

1249
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:28,920
her frequently about this

1250
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:30,690
there's multi multiple strategies that

1251
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,000
they're engaging in to continue to

1252
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:34,769
attack us and continue to try to cripple

1253
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,449
this industry and those people are not

1254
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:43,590
going to stop unless we you know unless

1255
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:46,769
we shout and scream basically the review

1256
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:50,100
that I did on that bill it seemed that

1257
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:52,980
the focus the scope of 9:30 was becoming

1258
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:55,440
more and more narrow only for direct

1259
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:58,070
services provided to these businesses as

1260
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,710
we know businesses have lots of related

1261
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:03,990
services is it gonna get expanded is it

1262
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:07,740
gonna remain so small and it has no

1263
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:11,879
support from banking community as far as

1264
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:14,339
I know this is not a policy of the state

1265
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:17,760
treasurer it is an opinion from his

1266
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:19,410
policy adviser so just to be clear on

1267
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:23,160
that because there's media in the room

1268
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:25,799
he has not taken a position on SB 9:30

1269
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:28,259
or did not take a position

1270
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,950
it was my view which I expressed to the

1271
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:36,540
author and to the sponsor that the bill

1272
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:38,519
had some infirmities simply because of

1273
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:42,090
the economics of the banking business

1274
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:46,259
and the manner in which new banks are

1275
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:49,370
set up now having said that I was

1276
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:54,390
reminded of a story that I was told by

1277
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:59,219
former state senator Arcturus who back

1278
00:57:54,389 --> 00:58:01,170
in the thinking now middle 1980s some of

1279
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:06,299
you are old enough to remember PSA

1280
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:08,730
Airlines and air cow and gasoline prices

1281
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:11,370
went up and air fares from Southern

1282
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:14,280
California went up with them and Senator

1283
00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:15,000
Torres in a politically brilliant move

1284
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,040
said

1285
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,969
I've got a great idea we can get these

1286
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:22,619
guys to the table if I introduce a bill

1287
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:26,129
suggesting that we have a state airline

1288
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:27,960
and suddenly everybody from the airline

1289
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:31,530
started to show up in Sacramento to

1290
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:34,260
discuss fair regulation and it was my

1291
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:37,080
view to Senator Hertzberg because I'm

1292
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:39,030
not a political expert by any means but

1293
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:42,299
it was my view to Senator Hertzberg and

1294
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:44,160
to the sponsor of the bill that SB 930

1295
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:47,000
will have accomplished an awful lot if

1296
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:49,289
you simply get the conversation started

1297
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,139
anything you can do to get the

1298
00:58:49,289 --> 00:58:55,110
conversation started and even if it's

1299
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:57,420
grunting and sweating to make that ball

1300
00:58:55,110 --> 00:59:00,870
move forward just a couple of inches is

1301
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:04,079
probably a good fight they have so yes I

1302
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:05,559
think you can expect to see

1303
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:09,789
