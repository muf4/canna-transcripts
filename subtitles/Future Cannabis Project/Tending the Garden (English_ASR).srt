industrial agriculture is destroying the

ourselves with chemical

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,600
the highest contributors to climate

20
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,039
one of the most powerful things about

21
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:58,399
cannabis is it's a

22
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:00,478
psychoactive medicine and what cannabis

23
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:05,280
has the ability to do

24
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:09,399
is connect your mind to connect your

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,399
soul back to things that are

26
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:20,800
real I truly believe that a plant is

27
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:23,959
made out of the soil the water and the

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,280
air that it is surrounded

29
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:31,840
by it uses the energy of the sun to

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,840
create its physical matter out of air

31
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:38,400
and if we are creating a psychoactive

32
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,400
plant we are what we

33
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,440
smoke we have the experience that is

34
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:50,439
what those plants have

35
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,318
created and I want to connect people

36
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:54,800
back to Something Real back to the

37
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,639
source that can make us feel whole again

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,150
that can make us feel connected with the

39

41
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,199
I came from Back to the land

42
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:11,878
homesteaders who chose to go and find

43
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,639
career

44
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,639
paths I got this opportunity to come

45
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,559
back to this dilapidated Homestead when

46
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,839
I was about 24 years old and the little

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,759
cabin that we lived in when I was a baby

48
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,439
was absorbed into the forest and trees

49
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,719
were grown up everywhere and all the

50
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,000
infrastructure was falling apart and I

51
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,598
set about repairing and and rebuilding

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,759
our

53
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:37,359
Homestead we arrived in each other's

54
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,399
lives in Hawaii ran into each other at a

55
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,959
c

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,680
bar it was like 6 months after we

57
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,560
started dating you moved here and we got

58
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,280
goats like couple weeks a couple weeks

59
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,810
after Taylor moved here and decided to

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:04:00,800
do farmers market the next summer yeah

61

[Music]

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,158
I mean when we started switching our

63
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,878
vegetable production over to no till it

64
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,318
was daunting at first the returns maybe

65
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,840
didn't happen that first year or even

66
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,280
the second year as the soil was left

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,399
Freer of disturbance from us and got to

68
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,478
get more into its own true balance

69
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,799
flavor was so much better the ability

70
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,199
for that food to stay fresh like you

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,560
would Harvest it and a week later it

72
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,560
looked like you had just harvested it

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,840
the most vital healthy vibrant food and

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,240
that's what I want to see my myself and

75
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,959
my family eating that's what I want to

76
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,680
see my community

77
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:45,959
eating each transaction I just feel like

78
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,959
I'm handing them a pack of Life Force

79
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,439
energy when we first started farming you

80
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,839
kind of just see the vegetables as the

81
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,680
goal and the deeper you get into it even

82
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,799
one or two seasons into it you start to

83
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,079
see the reverse

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,680
image you know you spend all year

85
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:06,079
working on making this perfect soil it's

86
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,199
alive and complex cover crop is that

87
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,198
vital way of continuing to

88
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,478
photosynthesize and then it's pulling

89
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,680
energy from the Sun pulling carbon out

90
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,680
of the air to build its

91
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,079
structure so it's just watching the

92
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,199
world make itself out of these elements

93
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,839
and then you put it back in it's just

94
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,038
like it's most beautiful

95
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:32,399
Circle so when I first got here the soil

96
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:34,519
I had to work with was 6% organic matter

97
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:38,159
and fast forward a decade of noil

98
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:41,169
farming and we're at 24% organic matter

99
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,319
that translates to 14% stable

[Music]

101
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,600
carbon that much of an increase in a

102
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:52,120
decade means we've sequestered nearly

103
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:58,240
120 tons of carbon on an acre or

104
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,240
equivalent to driving a car for 27 years

107
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,599
we have a 60 Acre Farm here in Round

108
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,918
Valley we have a really Diversified Farm

109
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:37,439
we grow vegetables and

110
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,439
herbs medicinal

111
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:43,318
cannabis we have sheep and cows and

112
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,680
chickens I grew up in LA but grew up

113
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,519
camping and like kind of super nature

114
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,759
sciency kid decided to study fashion

115
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,318
design and thought I could change the

116
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,759
world through Tex Styles changing the

117
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,520
textile industry then realized that I

118
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,598
really didn't want to be a part of that

119
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,639
industry ended up on a biodynamic farm

120
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:12,759
in Hawaii had no idea what biodynamics

121
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,079
was and I think that was like a huge

122
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,080
pivotal moment in my

123
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,479
life like Blair I always kind of

124
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,120
considered myself an environmentalist

125
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:26,159
but wound up uh working out in the oil

126
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,918
rigs uh in the Gulf of Mexico I did a

127
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,840
couple other endeavors they were very

128
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,839
shortlived and then fin farming

129
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,198
stuck I feel like the sheep have a

130
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,400
special place in my heart it was kind of

131
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,160
like the first animals that Daniel and I

132
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,638
owned

133
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,879
together having animals raised on

134
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,918
pasture is a huge gift to the farm and

135
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:53,039
to the land the grass is able to grow

136
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,519
really easily all it needs is energy

137
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,918
from the Sun and it's able to sequester

138
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,478
carbon into the

139
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:03,439
soil the animals then eat that grass

140
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,959
they then poop and pee and give back to

141
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,759
the Earth in that way and then we're

142
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,839
able to use their manure in our garden

143
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,879
to make

144
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:16,158
compost when they're ready to give us

145
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,120
their gift of their bodies that's I

146
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:20,399
think some of the most nutritious meat

147
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,399
out

148
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:28,439
there I think there's endless

149
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,439
opportunities for education for a kid on

150
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,958
the farm

151
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,519
just being able to interact with the

152
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:39,759
animals and interact with the

153
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:42,200
land the kind of microorganisms that

154
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,958
he's intaking just by being able to

155
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,600
touch the soil touch the compost touch

156
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:52,369
the poop we don't shy away from any of

157
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,040
that okay keep it in the

158

okay squ s

161
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,639
yeah yeah yeah we feel so lucky that

162
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,240
we're able to provide the type of food

163
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,679
that we are and know that he's eating

164
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,560
the best possible food that he can be

165
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:16,199
eating and that I am too and I'm able to

166
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,278
feed him through breastfeeding really

167
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,399
nutritious milk some I like to say I

168
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:22,399
have certified biodynamic breast

169
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:31,078
milk Earth who gives to us this food Sun

00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:39,039
dear Earth dear by you we

172
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:43,958
liveing thanks to you we give blessings

173
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:48,199
on the meal okay you going to serve

174
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,199
everybody thank you

175
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,920
once people ask me like well what do you

176
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:13,240
do and I have to try and come up with

177
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:18,039
like a few sentences to explain it it's

178
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,039
really hard it's it's my whole

179
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,200
life I was a wildland firefighter from

180
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,240
age 19 to 22 coming from the

181
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,519
firefighting world I was very physical

182
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,159
and I needed like a very physical job to

183
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,959
fulfill that and so I got into farming I

184
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,039
couldn't help but notice that Nicholas

185
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:46,000
was on like this interesting parallel

186
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,838
path but in this whole other way he did

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,799
everything on a bike and uh and I would

188
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,320
see him biking around town like like

189
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,958
with his trailer filled with vegetables

190
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,079
I was bartending at this real hip Cafe

191
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:03,278
in town and he was hired by the C to

192
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:05,599
provide food well Elizabeth was so sweet

193
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,679
she'd always hooked me up there oh yeah

194
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,240
so that's how I was like chemistry

195
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,879
started maybe in like getting the

196
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,519
freestyle free breakfast and stuff and I

197
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,799
was always kind of committed to like I

198
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
don't want it to look like agriculture

199
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,479
yeah cuz I from the beginning was like I

200
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,480
think the problem is

201
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,879
agriculture one of the core components

202
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,959
of a regenerative mindset is to

203
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,838
understand the source of how things

204
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:34,319
function and to me that's the

205
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,639
soil I think most people are buying

206
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,240
their potting

207
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,079
soil we've never purchased soils to

208
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,159
start stuff with we've always worked

209
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:47,120
with soils from the animal

210
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:50,439
yard like a plant that's grown in a pot

211
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,720
in engineered soil will not express

212
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,200
itself the same way as plants grown in

213
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,639
this medium that is a result of

214
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,639
gathering resources from the place I

215
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,799
think it has a lot to do with why our

216
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:07,639
plants reach such a full

217
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:10,319
expression and it's so biologically

218
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,320
mature all our fertility is essentially

219
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,240
a result of the animals manures so there

220
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,480
we have a great source of microbiology

221
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,399
from the rumin of many different species

222
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,680
of animals and this is why we don't just

223
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,480
have one variety of animals but like to

224
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,958
make sure we have several because we

225
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,320
like knowing that there's some donkey

226
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,399
some llama some goat and some sheep and

227
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,760
some chickens and all the different

228
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,839
bacteria that are formed in those guts

229
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,679
play a role in our soil so the more

230
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,639
diverse that is the more resilient I

231
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,559
feel like this is and I think that's

232
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,959
that's

233
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,838
key same with the wood chips it's not

234
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,359
like we try to just get one kind of wood

235
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,240
chip it's like the more different types

236
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,199
of wood chips mixed together is actually

237
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,198
the better wood

238
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,440
ship this is a good way I think to

239
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,360
establish a Rel relationship for the

240
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,600
plants to the place and the source of

241
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,039
the soil so that when it goes out it is

242
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,759
already familiar with what it's going

243
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:13,039
into this is what our soil looks like up

244
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,039
on the

245
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,879
hill I think terroir is just kind of a

246
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,719
fancy

247
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:27,240
word I simply feel like it's kind of the

248
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,240
energy of the

249
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,240
place but I think the ter

250
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,319
goes deeper in that I think it includes

251
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,759
the mentality and the connection of the

252
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,120
person and people doing the planting and

253
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,679
the and the

254
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,519
growing it has a lot to do with place

255
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,519
and it has a lot to do also with

256
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,519
practices

257
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:09,919
[Music]

258
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,439
you know when we first got goats I was

259
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,198
looking forward to the milk and the

260
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,880
cheese but they also add this incredible

261
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:19,679
layer of security to our Homestead they

262
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:23,480
do brush clearing and fire safety

263
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:25,559
clearing they connected me deeply into a

264
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,839
system of interacting with animals and

265
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,319
livestock that's been part of human

266
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,959
history for a long time and to be with

267
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,519
these animals you see that they know

268
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,518
this relationship

269
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,240
too industrial agriculture has viewed

270
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,959
every Agricultural Product whether it's

271
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,120
something we eat or something we wear as

272
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,000
something to extract from the earth

273
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,360
something that's there to be taken and

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,278
then you'll take it until it's gone and

275
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:57,019
regenerative agriculture sees the farmer

276
00:14:52,278 --> 00:15:00,159
as one dot in this interconnected Circle

277
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:02,439
[Music]

278
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,319
regenerative farming that was the

279
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,639
indigenous way of existing that was the

280
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,959
original way of living on this planet

281
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,879
was to regenerate each cycle each year

282
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:16,638
you had to go into that year with what

283
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,639
it took to make the cycle happen

284
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:31,919
again we're working to create a buffer

285
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:35,838
of healthy thriving Forest around our

286
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:39,078
Homestead selectively removing trees and

287
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,759
material and then pile burning

288
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:45,599
it reducing the intensity of potential

289
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,600
fire around our

290
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:52,000
Homestead it's also a project to

291
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,198
increase the health of the forest around

292
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,600
our Homestead too open up more light

293
00:15:54,198 --> 00:16:00,919
down to the forest floor so we get more

294
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,920
species that our goats can eat

295
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,078
you know when I go through the under

296
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,879
story of the forest around here I try to

297
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:13,479
see it as the old growth forest it could

298
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:15,799
become people have been using fire to

299
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,759
tend to their environment for thousands

300
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,758
upon thousands of

301
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:26,198
years what western colonialists and

302
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:30,399
settlers thought of as this beautiful

303
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:33,359
untouched Wilderness was a t

304
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,120
Garden we're hoping to bring some of

305
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,600
that knowledge and some of that balance

306
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,600
of fire back to the landscape

307
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,439
I've recently gotten more involved in

308
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,959
policy work before I felt like I didn't

309
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,199
really have the time we were kind of

310
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,318
just in survival mode on the farm but I

311
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,919
feel really fortunate that I have the

312
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:27,240
opportunity to be involved in

313
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,000
policy could I sorry can I I just wanted

314
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,120
to ask one other thing about about um

315
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,359
just getting questions to the land use

316
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:40,079
attorney about our different options

317
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:40,079
moving forward thank you move to a

318
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:47,279
journ so far the way that the legal

319
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,000
industry has been structured we're just

320
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,558
like extremely separated from the

321
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,759
consumer the consumer goes into these

322
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:56,720
dispensaries of really no connection to

323
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:59,720
what this product is in this tiny little

324
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,720
jar

325
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,520
it's really important for us to remove

326
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,440
all those other steps that happen

327
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:08,798
between flower in the garden to flower

328
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,320
in the consumer's hand so people

329
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,960
understand like hey maybe I don't want

330
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:17,759
my flower grown under artificial lights

331
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,120
in fake soil using synthetic fertilizers

332
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,519
by you know some big

333
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:25,558
Corporation actually I want my flower

334
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:28,839
grown by people who care who are growing

335
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:30,798
in the soil with actual sunlight and

336
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,959

in the most profitable

really involved in like the anti-vietnam

our governments aren't going to do that

depressing sad reality of our world and

believe that humans were bad for the

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,720
dosing over time there really starts to

506
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,720
have a positive

507
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,960
effect we want him to understand that

508
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,119
you know it's not necessarily about

509
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:23,079
farming it's about

510
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:25,719
relating knowing where the food is not

511
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:29,879
having some idea that food is from the

512
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:33,640
store you know because it's from the the

513
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:37,000
land hopefully he's eaten peaches and

514
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,200
just exploring this relationship to food

515
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
cuz food is really a one of the best

516
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,120
ways to connect to the Earth and to the

517
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,519
land because we can all appreciate good

518
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:49,000
food and you can't appreciate it more

519
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:53,059
than when you acquire it without going

520
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:06,848
to the store to make it happen

[Music]

529
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,200
them so I grew up in Salt Lake City Utah

530
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,519
couldn't be a more different cultural

531
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,399
setting than humble California and I

532
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,120
love to do this little thought exercise

533
00:29:54,398 --> 00:30:00,000
of whisking my 18-year-old self here and

534
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:02,158
showing myself that I'm raising children

535
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,798
on a pot farm in the woods and it would

536
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,799
have it would have seemed insane I would

537
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:10,119
have considered myself endangering the

538
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:12,158
children and so I try to keep that

539
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:15,038
perspective in my mind when I imagine

540
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:18,240
how this looks from the

541
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:21,480
outside I grew up around cannabis a lot

542
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,079
my stepdad grew and it was a big secret

543
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,880
you'd go to school and they'd be having

544
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:26,639
the Dare program where the cops would be

545
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,919
trying to talk you into turning your

546
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,679
parents in for for drugs I mean talk

547
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,240
about having the opposite effect uh we I

548
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,960
took the dare you know yeah we grew up

549
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,000
in the prohibition

550
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,880
era I think it's important to normalize

551
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,398
like what a cannabis farmer is or

552
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,240
diversify the idea of what a cannabis

553
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:52,558
farmer

554
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:55,480
is it is just a

555
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,638
plant if my kid touches a pot leaf

556
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,839
they're not going to get high and we

557
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:02,079
don't treat the plant differently than

558
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,798
we treat our other plants and we don't

559
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,918
think that we have

560
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:08,398
to obviously Edibles are a whole other

561
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,600
you know a whole other thing but when

562
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,959
you're talking about a plant in a garden

563
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:15,240
it's a completely different thing just

564
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,840
like you're talking about a grape and a

565
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,839
Vineyard and what we're still doing in

566
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:25,119
this fear around it is like really

567
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:27,439
unnecessary you know it made us really

568
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:30,398
nervous because we were growing cannabis

569
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,000
before cannabis was regulated in the

570
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:35,199
current way that it is and as we started

571
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,679
to have kids was one of the reasons that

572
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,278
it pushed us into going through

573
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,679
compliance and and getting a legal

574
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:44,278
cannabis farm is that we really didn't

575
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,880
want our kids to grow up with the

576
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:50,359
secrets we wanted them to understand and

577
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,399
be proud of what their parents do see it

578
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:55,918
as actual work rather than hearing from

579
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:58,638
society that their parents are drug

580
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,038
dealers or or whatever and then also not

581
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:03,839
having to carry the burden of a secret

582
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:08,079
and the responsibility of if you mess up

583
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,079
it's dangerous for your family

other so this is the early stages and it

fruity musk it's kind of got me at all

that sweet Savory salty sharp everything

651
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:33,480
the smell version of that where it's

652
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:38,000
like fruit and pining and Fuel and musk

653
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,000
and all of it kind of coming together at

654
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,240
once when we decided to become a

655
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:48,078
compliant Farm there was this Vision

656
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:50,279
that we could finally meet our customers

657
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,039
visions of Farmers Market booth with our

658
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,880
vegetables and our cannabis and just

659
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:57,679
this lovely idea it made us really

660
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,519
hopeful and excited and then as we

661
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:03,960
entered the legal Market there were so

662
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:05,759
many blocks so many walls between us and

663
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,240
the customers in some ways more than

664
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,079
before California has created and many

665
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:13,759
states that have gone legal have created

666
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,519
kind of like a spider web of traps of

667
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,240
bureaucracy we can't take cannabis to

668
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:21,679
customers we have to work through a

669
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:24,318
distributor it has to be packaged it has

670
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,838
to be tested it has to get to retail so

671
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:29,199
basically you have the system of

672
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:31,679
multiple places along the way every

673
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,799
place along the way wants to take a cut

674
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,399
of the profit a lot of times you'll see

675
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,200
cannabis on the shelves in California

676
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,000
that's over a year old because it took

677
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:42,719
eight months just to get from the farmer

678
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,679
to the Shelf through all the hands that

679
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:48,159
it has to pass through the bud loses

680
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:51,078
quality it loses tricomes and out of

681
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,199
that was born this idea of Farm Cut Farm

682
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,240
Cut Is minimally processed with just the

683
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:58,799
sugar leaves we want to share like a

684
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,598
true Farm stack stash and a true Farm

685
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,000
stash is a mason jar full of untrimmed

686
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:06,720
weed it's because it stays better that

687
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,358
way and you start breaking away your

688
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,358
your leaves to prep it it's

689
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:16,159
fresh every plant has to be tagged with

690
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,240
a plastic tag with an RFID chip that

691
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:22,399
becomes garbage after you use it once I

692
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:25,118
don't enjoy putting them on the plants I

693
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,039
don't enjoy taking them off I don't

694
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,559
enjoy hauling them to the dump I don't

695
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:33,079
enjoy getting them in the mail it's this

696
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:36,078
difficult balance to be a

697
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,880
regenerative cannabis Farmer in the

698
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:42,079
recreational Market we care so deeply

699
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,599
about wanting to provide this ethical

700
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,800
clean product for people and then we

701
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,880
have to wrap it in plastic and separate

702
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,880
it out into grams and leaves and little

703
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,760
plastic containers and you know it's

704
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,680
just awful it's a terrible

705
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,480
trash producing industry right

706
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:06,960
now and so we have been endeavoring in

707
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,119
compostable packaging and minimally

708
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:13,000
processed and at an economic price and I

709
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,440
think some of the the real Drive behind

710
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,679
the E ounce is like when we think about

711
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,960
who we want to be accessing our cannabis

712
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:22,960
it's the people that love

713
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,000
it we want to give them something that

714
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,318
that's really high quality at a

715
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,440
reasonable price and the only way you

716
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:33,440
could do that is in larger

717
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,440
quantities as a farmer you make a very

718
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,039
very small percentage of what the

719
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,358
customer actually pays for that product

720
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:54,559
that you

721
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:57,358
produced 5 to six maybe 7% if you're

722
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:59,358
lucky

723
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,318
and so that wouldn't make sense for a

724
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:04,838
small farm large Farms can scale up

725
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:07,559
enough that profit can work but it means

726
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:10,078
growing acres and Acres we don't plan to

727
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:12,078
survive as a farm under that model we

728
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,839
plan to survive long enough until that

729
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,680
model changes and if that model doesn't

730
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:19,480
change you won't see small Family Farms

731

the cost down and maintain your quality

how are you doing that you know that's a

744
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:37,039
great question we uh we right now grow

745
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:40,599
in 500,000 Square ft and we've been

746
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:43,159
doing it since 2016 so we had to learn

747
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:45,359
um on the Fly because there was nobody

748
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:47,399
growing at that scale it was it was new

749
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,039
people were growing in closets not in

750
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,240
huge green houses but the person that's

751
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:55,440
that built this 6 million or sorry 5

million5 uh sare foot Greenhouse he's

753
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,280
he's helping us with it because he's

754
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,159
grown other um vegetables and things

755
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,800
like that so we're confident that we'll

756
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,799
be able to do it

757

all right let's go hang this shit let's

series of cold mornings low 20s and lost

766

significant percentage of the garden to

be out there and to see the plants

00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:56,400
covered in ice is not easy it was like

holy shit like is this really happening

770
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,280
again and we do know like through

771
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,760
vegetable production that certain plants

772
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,319
can handle frost more than other plants

773
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,520
some plants can't handle it at all and

luckily cannabis is one of those plants

been done there's a movement that has

784
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,519
huge momentum right now and small

785
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:54,280
farming is the key and resolution to so

786
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:56,119
much of the problems in the world and

787
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,480
it's important for us to be independent

788
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:59,960
from Corporation

789
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,280
and to be independent in our food

790
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:06,079
production and build Connections in

791
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,440
community Through food I think that's a

792
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,400
lot of what is lost in the world now and

793
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,039
away from this digital world and having

794
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,639
our hands in the earth I think would

795
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:16,639
heal so

796
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:23,078
much we're a tiny Farm but the practices

797
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,919
we're putting in place the amount of

798
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:27,599
carbon that you can pull out of the

799
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,838
atmosphere and put into your soil if

800
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,599
this was happening at the industrial

801
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,239
scale you know it would hugely change

802
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:37,359
the course we're

803
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,479
on and I picture our farm as this tiny

804
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,719
little postage stamp of change and

805
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:44,240
pulling in this tiny little postage

806
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:46,239
stamp amount of carbon but then I

807
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,759
picture what that would look like if

808
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,000
every little farm was doing something

809
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,000
like

810
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:54,920
that I've always thought like if a

811
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,079
person grows a garden it is the most

812
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,880
pure expression of their soul that you

813
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:00,559
can see you know some people are like

814
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,838
you should write a book like how do you

815
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:08,079
how how to book and I'm like no it will

816
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:10,000
be different for every single person and

817
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,680
how cool is that you know like I want to

818
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,760
see everyone's Garden what in Eden if

819
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:18,118
everybody if every human could have a

00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:23,280
couple acres to just grow their Garden

any seed the greater World wants to tell

828
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:05,719
you that to be radical is to be a fringe

829
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,720
to be you know on the periphery and not

830

really

831
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:11,598
grounded but when you look at the root

832
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,559
of the word to be radical is to be

833
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:18,039
grounded because the radical is the root

00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,280
aware of your surroundings and you

837
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,880
listen to your intuition that is what

838
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,960
the world needs right now it needs

839
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,160
radical people and that's what farming

840
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,599
has done for

841
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:39,879
us farming has kind of allowed me to to

842
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,880
be uh grounded

[Music]

844
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,760
radical because that's what we're trying

845
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:48,558
to do right now I think is right we're

846
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,799
trying to replace the current Paradigm

847
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,440
of industrial agriculture because it's

848
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:56,880
not working it's destroying the

849
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:59,000
environment and we're not looking to

850
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,358
destroy anything we're looking to

851
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,159
replace what is currently happening with

852
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:05,759
a better system and it it means

853
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:08,358
everybody has to get involved if you

854
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,920
want to eat vegetables only that's great

855
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:13,358
but you should find it locally if you

856
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,680
want to eat meat too that's great but

857
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:17,440
you should find it locally I'm trying to

858
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,078
be like polite and say we're not trying

859
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,920
to destroy anything we're trying to

860
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:22,920
replace it but we are looking to destroy

861
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:26,000
the industrial food model I think it

862
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,559
needs to be destroyed and from that is

863
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,199
going to emerge stronger local

864
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:31,920
communities that are taking this stuff

865
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,919
into their own

866

hands over the last three billion years

867
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:48,239
Nature has finally tuned herself to

868
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:51,118
connect soil air and water in infinite

eventually destroy the

regenerative practices on a fraction of

00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,279
this land

882
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:33,639
we can sequester enough carbon to undo

883
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,640
some of the damage we've

884
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:43,558
done as we experience more extreme

destruction every year due to climate

886
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:48,960
change there is an urgent need to act

887
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:57,329
