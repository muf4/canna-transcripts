1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,730
interesting appointment it was a

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,919
different appointment that I think most

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,209
people are expecting I think that you

4
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,939
know we all knew that Matt Whittaker was

5
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,259
a temporary appointment so now it's a

6
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,178
question of you know getting a real

7
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,830
pointment through everyone thought Pam

8
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,528
Bondi had a really good chance who's the

9
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,750
current AG of Florida and now we've had

10
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:21,899
a new guy named who was formerly you

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,960
know working for George HW Bush who's

12
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:27,929
you know kind of most famous legacy of

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,880
that administration was that he was the

14
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:33,238
person that championed pardons for every

15
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:35,429
one of the iran-contra criminals or

16
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:36,479
people that were involved so when you

17
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:38,670
think about you know the reason that

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,689
he's being appointed you know I don't

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,039
think that's a great deal to do with

20
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,718
cannabis I don't think as a great deal

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,280
do with you know criminal justice reform

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,558
or anything else you'd think an AG might

23
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,390
be involved in but it certainly has a

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,218
great deal to do with you know the

25
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,020
Muller investigation what you can expect

26
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,308
a new AG that you know what Trump

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,559
expects this person will do in a

28
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:58,049
specific situation so how does that

29
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,089
relate to cannabis we don't know enough

30
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:01,529
yet this is a you know this name was

31
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,618
only floated around probably in the last

32
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,609
week it came as a surprise to me I

33
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:06,719
thought there was three or four other

34
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,599
people that certainly were gonna get the

35
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,969
nod before he did I think that because

36
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,390
HW was in the news a lot last week with

37
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,469
his passing that people started looking

38
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,150
at some people that have been around for

39
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,429
a long time that might be an easy

40
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,140
confirmation and I think that this is at

41
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,610
least to come from a nomination that

42
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,719
will be confirmed relatively easily by

43
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:27,329
the Senate because he's already been

44
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,728
there before he's had bipartisan support

45
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:32,819
he's largely seen as someone that is a

46
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:33,719
law-and-order guy but now we've gotta

47
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,569
think about what it means for the

48
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,789
cannabis industry and I I don't know

49
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,008
enough yet I would expect based on what

50
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,390
hws policy was towards cannabis and

51
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,659
towards drugs in general I mean this is

52
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,978
a guy that presided during the Len Bias

53
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,450
issue and was the person that escalated

54
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,159
the war on drugs probably in a way that

55
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,930
we'd never seen you know for those of

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,909
you old enough to remember what Humboldt

57
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,200
County was like in 1989 it was probably

58
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,960
the worst you know pop famine summer

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,030
we've ever seen because camp was flying

60
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,459
and dropping nets like we've no never

61
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,489
seen any since so that was led by by

62
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,139
this AG so we'll say but I can't imagine

63
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:08,219
it's good for the industry but I don't

64
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,409
think it's you know any worse than

65
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:17,039
sessions

66
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:19,050
give me your reflections it's

67
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,030
surprisingly I'm gonna say I didn't mind

68
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,030
him as an AG you know I absolutely

69
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,140
detest him as a person going into the

70
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,340
position I thought he used to be

71
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,439
terrible for cannabis when his

72
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,229
nomination happened but the day he

73
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,300
recused himself from from the Russia

74
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:35,369
investigation was the day that he was no

75
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,990
longer powerful as an attorney general

76
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,240
yeah he no longer had the ear of the

77
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,710
president it didn't matter what do you

78
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,780
wanted to do it he wasn't gonna have the

79
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,159
ability to get through and you know he

80
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,719
was probably the most feckless Attorney

81
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,079
General I've ever seen in my lifetime

82
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,729
and it didn't really it didn't really

83
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,650
affect the cannabis industry at all it

84
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,090
was one of those things that you had so

85
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,010
much fear and there was so much hype

86
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,960
about you know sessions taking over as

87
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,969
the AG and the worst thing the guy did

88
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,770
was uh was repeal the coal memorandum

89
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:03,359
and then never even you know go after

90
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,650
anyone never prosecuted him and never

91
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,040
really changed anything in a meaningful

92
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,990
way but it was a he allowed the industry

93
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,250
to continue to proliferate which is you

94
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,659
know no different than what Holder did

95
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,250
no different than what Lynch did no

96
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,169
different than what any other AG is done

97
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,330
for the last you know call it 12 years

98
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,919
so I thought sessions

99
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,710
I thought sessions be a lot worse and

100
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,789
I'm pleased to see him gone but but I

101
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,810
don't think he really had any real

102
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:26,810
effect on canvas
