00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
[Music]

2
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:11,529
you have a history in vape cartridges

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:13,718
yes from your days slinging nicotine so

4
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:16,179
now you're slinging weeds so that's true

5
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:18,820
so talk about kind of the evolution and

6
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:20,859
what you've seen and then maybe some of

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,649
the toxicity issues we were hearing

8
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:27,070
about now yeah so I mean as far as

9
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:29,349
toxicity goes with a lot of the vape

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:33,340
hardware that's available in the THC

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:37,600
space what a lot of the consumers don't

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:40,359
understand is that each of the products

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,999
aren't made equally so it ultimately

14
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:45,010
comes down to the original source of the

15
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:51,159
raw material so the same with steel the

16
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:53,018
brass the ceramic there's a you know

17
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:54,579
there's there's a good and bad for

18
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:57,149
everything you know you can buy cheap

19
00:00:54,579 --> 00:01:03,039
metal where you can buy expensive metal

20
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:05,799
the biggest thing is you know all flour

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,689
and extraction processes are different

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,969
across the board you know you have guys

23
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:11,109
using butane you have you guys using dry

24
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:15,158
ice

25
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:18,420
you guys have using co2 and that all

26
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:21,909
reacts differently with different metals

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,250
so the biggest thing is when you do send

28
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,280
a cartridge to get tested for have heavy

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:31,030
metals and it comes back as a fail what

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:37,299
ends up happening is the oil is etching

31
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:39,960
away at the metal inside it's yeah it's

32
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:43,030
pretty much leaching into the oil and

33
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,438
this is when it comes bus or even when

34
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,810
it's just sitting there even when it's

35
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:51,178
just sitting there there you know the

36
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:55,349
whole combustion process isn't as

37
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:58,390
important there is there is a metal

38
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:02,890
there is metal wire in there and

39
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:05,500
you know that most folks don't look into

40
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,979
that but you know we can either be a

41
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:13,360
source of Kanthal stainless steel

42
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:15,490
there's nickel so they all serve its

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,770
purpose you know and that's just a

44
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,439
heating element of it the ceramic itself

45
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,300
most people have this thought of oh the

46
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,759
ceramic heats up well there needs to be

47
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,030
two wires that run into that ceramic to

48
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:29,889
give you a positive and a negative to

49
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,759
get an actual electric current in there

50
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:36,159
but back to the heavy metals you know

51
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,219
like I was saying even when the oil sits

52
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,560
there it will etch away and leach from

53
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:44,050
that metal so if you are using a lower

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,959
quality metal or you're sourcing lower

55
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:50,500
quality cartridge you can't always trust

56
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,959
that there's a you know that that

57
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,729
product is going to be heavy metal

58
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:01,810
passing so it really comes down to the

59
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:04,750
raw materials used and also to the

60
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,209
quality control at the factory level so

61
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,169
a lot of our products are thoroughly

62
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:13,719
washed rinsed and there's a whole

63
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:16,449
cleansing process for the raw material

64
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,699
that we use before they actually get

65
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:21,459
sent to the assembly line and broken

66
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:23,548
down into the appropriate pieces for

67
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:27,280
assembly

68
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:29,530
so I mean the thing is a lot of this

69
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,979
technology stems from the Electronic

70
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:36,669
Cigarette world and a lot of where the

71
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:39,609
industry may move forward will kind of

72
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:41,829
follow suit of how things were in that

73
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:46,720
industry you know five ten cartridges

74
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:49,330
are a technology of the past in the

75
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,909
electronic cigarette industry world but

76
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,719
they've been repurposed for a reason you

77
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:58,729
know better ceramics are used for

78
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:01,159
thicker distillate and thinner CBD

79
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:04,369
so when it comes down to ceramic you can

80
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:07,659
also purchase a cheaper ceramic so you

81
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,310
can have a really coarse compacted

82
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:12,590
ceramic where if you were to break a

83
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,500
cartridge apart and open the coil you

84
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,329
can actually run your fingers through

85
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,418
that ceramic and it will kind of break

86
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:26,480
apart like sand then you have a solid

87
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:28,099
ceramic ware ceramic clarified yeah that

88
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,990
first scenario isn't good but it does

89
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,430
it's not what you're looking for but it

90
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,500
can work

91
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,199
you know if ever if all the other

92
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,610
material source is of quality it will

93
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:43,668
work extremely well but if you are using

94
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,650
more traditional well traditional in the

95
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:49,459
sense of this industry would be a more

96
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:52,399
ceramic core solid ceramic or you know

97
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:56,449
ceramic is porous in itself so that's

98
00:04:52,399 --> 00:05:00,889
what actually pulls in the actual dis

99
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:02,418
lit or oil and then in turn the positive

100
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,599
and negative wire that's running through

101
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:10,849
that ceramic is what's vaporizing the

102
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:14,120
THC other than that I mean you know that

103
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:16,310
I crusher we really emphasize on quality

104
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,430
control I mean we are working with some

105
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,500
of the top industry leaders in this

106
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:27,560
space when it comes to pod systems or

107
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:29,680
cartridges that I can't exactly give you

108
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,680
know

109
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:39,100
our customers are industry leaders and

110
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,430
while our clients are industry leaders

111
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,560
and they've kind of set a precedence of

112
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,720
what it is to move forward in the

113
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,810
industry you know they're they're making

114
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,790
sure their chain supply is up to par

115
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:58,019
that we can get them product and quality

116
00:05:51,790 --> 00:06:00,819
product at the same time you know it's I

117
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:03,069
can tell you that in the Southern

118
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:08,050
California region we probably have a

119
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:10,149
good ninety percent of what is out there

120
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,220
available to the general consumer right

121
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:17,409
now we are providing that hardware

122
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:19,030
specifically to those brands that you

123
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,770
know the general question let me ask

124
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:22,389
this we're being secretive about who

125
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,949
they are but I mean your stuffs pretty

126
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,259
apparent so like if I went into a

127
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:29,039
dispensary you could pick out your whoa

128
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:31,420
not necessarily because I mean in China

129
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,310
everyone we know the Chinese

130
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,560
manufacturing side of things you know

131
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,839
when it comes to shoes or purses there's

132
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,209
a bunch of factories that make the same

133
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:45,250
thing so it's hard to make something

134
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:48,819
that isn't going to get copied okay so

135
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:51,009
you you've innovated on the design but

136
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:53,019
then a month later or six months later

137
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:57,939
you see a bunch of identical looking you

138
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:59,589
know cheaper quality material yep yeah

139
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,110
and I mean it ultimately comes down to

140
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:05,109
the brands you know if they want to work

141
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,660
with a cheaper supplier that's fully up

142
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,689
to them just the general consumer

143
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,330
doesn't realize that they're not getting

144
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:15,160
the products not getting tested you know

145
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,109
you don't know if it's pesticide free

146
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,170
and you don't know if it's heavy metal

147
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:24,000
passing so that's the biggest thing is

148
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:27,430
for us you can we publicly we publicly

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,019
have everything on our website that lab

150
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,120
tested for every single one of our

151
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:36,269
products for our heavy metals you know

152
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,459
we are the provider of hardware

153
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:40,620
and you know what everyone else provides

154
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,419
is what they put into that and sell it

155
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,149
off to the rest of the market well so

156
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,040
let let's talk about kind of concentrate

157
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:49,649
and obviously there's been lots of

158
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:53,280
innovative new types of concentrates on

159
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:56,039
the market so in terms of like can you

160
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,929
talk about different concentrates and

161
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,460
maybe like their characteristics like

162
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,920
maybe they have different viscosities

163
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:05,609
and like how that affects and interplays

164
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:08,670
with you know which types of what type

165
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,540
of hardware technology is required of

166
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,340
course

167
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:17,850
so the general consumer right now has

168
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:20,759
this perception of clear is better

169
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:23,960
clearer is cleaner and that's not the

170
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:29,219
truth and that is honestly not the truth

171
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:34,649
you know if you were to leave a cup of

172
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:37,740
water outside during the day that air is

173
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:39,360
gonna bring so much stuff into that

174
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,700
water it's not going to be clear the

175
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,639
entire time it will turn yellow

176
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:47,670
it will turn Maui general consumers

177
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,759
don't realize that that once air and

178
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:53,159
heat is introduced into oil it will

179
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,889
oxidize that oil will oxidize and it's

180
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,889
not necessarily a bad thing think of it

181
00:08:55,889 --> 00:09:00,600
as a tea bag when you get a fresh tea

182
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:04,259
bag and you put it into a cup of water a

183
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,389
cup of hot water it's pretty clear and

184
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,789
you see the color change but if you

185
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:11,730
leave that tea bag in that hot cup of

186
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:13,409
water that tea bag starts to kind of

187
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,899
deteriorate the flowers deteriorate a

188
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:18,839
little bit more your tea starts to get

189
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,059
darker it's the same thing with oil

190
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,750
sometimes time gives it a little bit

191
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:26,279
better flavor so the general consumer

192
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,080
doesn't realize that when it comes to

193
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:34,679
viscosity and finding the correct device

194
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,470
for our clients that's all that's

195
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:40,049
totally up to them you know distillate

196
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,529
usually comes out extremely thick live

197
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:45,839
resin is you know extremely extremely

198
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:46,539
thick you you know it's almost a solid

199
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,000
at that

200
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:51,159
and that's where terpenes come into play

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,629
you know terpenes will break that down a

202
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:56,379
little bit give you a little bit more

203
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:59,379
flavor and you know that will change

204
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:02,110
there's gossiped e of the oil itself so

205
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:05,139
not all oil is made in tools not all oil

206
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,210
is meant to be clear and that's

207
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:10,919
something that most folks need to

208
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:14,310
realize is if you are using a lot of

209
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:19,240
terpenes to create a flavor profile for

210
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:21,819
your biomass you might have a looser

211
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:30,850
liquid than a looser oil I'm sorry a

212
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:32,770
looser oil rather than a thicker oil me

213
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,980
personally

214
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:40,059
I personally enjoy the two-two-one CBD

215
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,860
THC ratio just a little bit more mellow

216
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:45,789
bhai rather than something that's gonna

217
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:48,550
really get me you know couch-potato

218
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:52,209
mode and then is there a specific like

219
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:54,939
is it live resin two to one is it's it's

220
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:58,060
mainly distillate two to one two to one

221
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:01,690
with CBD you know anything with a twenty

222
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:03,879
five anything with a 60% CBD to you know

223
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:08,560
like a twenty percent thirty percent THC

224
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:13,750
is personally what I like I can say I do

225
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:14,889
enjoy this dizzy mango quite a bit I do

226
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,769
enjoy that quiter

227
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:20,289
and all your products showcased out here

228
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:22,840
which one would you smoke that out of

229
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:24,459
well unfortunately Susie doesn't provide

230
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,070
that in a syringe maybe that's an idea

231
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:31,120
for them to give to you know

232
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:33,480
dispensaries that might buy hardware for

233
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,259
the general consumers to fill their own

234
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:41,740
but me personally right now I am using

235
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:44,950
the Zen which is our newest device great

236
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:48,129
thing is it utilizes USB see charging

237
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:50,830
rather than the old micro USB that

238
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:52,450
everyone still uses so you know you're

239
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,460
not going to go having to look for

240
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:59,560
another wire because most folks have

241
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:01,660
either Apple or Android phone charger

242
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,250
and that plugs straight into this a

243
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:05,620
great thing is you have three settings

244
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,649
for it so you have a low medium and high

245
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,929
so if you are running a thicker oil in

246
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,189
the pod you know you can warm that up a

247
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:17,319
little bit more it's in the pod right

248
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:21,220
now right now this is a CBD this is just

249
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,310
plain CBD isolate with are you filling

250
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,800
it yourself is I filled this one up

251
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:28,539
myself yes okay but but is that let like

252
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:33,009
because I'm looking at that it's like a

253
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:35,230
fax looking platform but is is this a

254
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:37,990
disposable cartridge difficult

255
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,909
cartridges are usually one time usage so

256
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,629
you have your own proprietary platforms

257
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:45,730
that is standard know so it's all

258
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:49,809
proprietary you know each of our pods

259
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:52,000
are made to a certain spec there are a

260
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:54,759
few brands that we work with that you

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,649
know have really taken over that space

262
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,929
in a couple of states right now I know

263
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:02,860
Florida Michigan and Southern California

264
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:05,049
have the V fire and there's couple

265
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:09,190
brands that have really made that

266
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:11,679
specific device their own not this

267
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,220
specific device this one's the Zen B

268
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:18,729
fire is a little bit bigger of a device

269
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:21,850
yes this is I pressure the V fire is the

270
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,620
I crusher model and then there's a

271
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:28,300
couple there's a couple brands that

272
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:30,940
rebrand you know we don't I can't

273
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:34,479
disclose that information unfortunately

274
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,820
yeah wait we're talking I guess my

275
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,120
confusion is I'm seeing devices that

276
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,950
look like this that look well maybe not

277
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,480
this one but that that one specifically

278
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:50,379
looks like a brand would let me see the

279
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,170
pot itself so brands are ordering

280
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:55,269
thousands of these filling them you're

281
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:57,099
putting them in dispensaries on shelves

282
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:59,620
and it only works with your device yes

283
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,110
okay but the brands are also purchasing

284
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,470
the device and rebranding the pot is

285
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,300
there okay yes but point being they're

286
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,320
standardizing on your proprietary

287
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,269
technology platform which I find

288
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,640
interesting so because I know

289
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:14,829
so basically packs does that them guys

290
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,850
do that busy does that because what

291
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:21,250
historically I'm getting at is you know

292
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:24,570
common thread sizes right like what five

293
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,559
ten right so that that is thanks to the

294
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:30,520
electronic cigarette industry that

295
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:34,449
thread has become the standard and

296
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,730
that's because the electronic cigarette

297
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,259
industry there are a lot of smokers in

298
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:41,680
that industry there's a lot of people

299
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:44,019
that medicate and use recreational so a

300
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,419
lot of those guys can walk into any

301
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:50,069
dispensary and buy a 5-10 cartridge and

302
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:52,659
not be persuaded to buy a stick battery

303
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,040
you know they have ten lying around the

304
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,600
house yeah they have ten lying around

305
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,909
the house they got one of those really

306
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,590
big ones I'd blow clouds you know and

307
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:01,929
the thing is they can turn the power

308
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:07,240
down on those to work correctly four or

309
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:09,998
five ten cartridge okay so as a supplier

310
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,278
would you guys rather not like is this

311
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:15,519
kind of like an old technology

312
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:18,278
no it's been it's been repurposed and

313
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:21,759
it's been reworked to work better with

314
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:23,828
cannabis viscosity is the viscosity is

315
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:27,669
much thicker and the thing is you can't

316
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:30,128
pump more power into the cartridge if

317
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:34,178
you do that you end up in turn burning

318
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:36,369
the THC molecules and completely whoa at

319
00:15:34,178 --> 00:15:41,438
that point what is the purpose of it you

320
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:43,540
know I mean so you know for this is my

321
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:45,389
one advice that most consumers is you've

322
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:50,349
seen guys with electronic cigarettes

323
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:52,178
blown clouds clouds does not make the

324
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,928
cartridge any better it doesn't make

325
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:57,669
your distillate any better you know at

326
00:15:55,928 --> 00:16:00,100
the end of the day the general consumer

327
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:02,349
knows that there's one reason why

328
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,259
they're doing this they're trying to get

329
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,178
their high they're trying to lower their

330
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:09,550
anxiety you know or even for metal

331
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:14,919
report medical purposes that are trying

332
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:20,469
to prevent a seizure you know but cloud

333
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:22,118
production is not a huge factor I think

334
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,798
perception wise so what you're saying is

335
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:25,899
if you blow and you don't see anything

336
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:27,428
you're still getting you're still

337
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,818
getting something now because I was

338
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:32,889
dealing with that actually with the

339
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:34,389
ghost babe where I kept sucking and

340
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:36,308
blowing and being like I don't see any

341
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:38,619
vapor but then I was like but I'm super

342
00:16:36,308 --> 00:16:41,048
high yeah exactly

343
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:43,869
everyone's different everyone's lung

344
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:45,970
capacity is different do I mean I mean I

345
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:49,709
can get a pretty big cloud from this if

346
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,709
I really drew on it you know so

347
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,820
right that that's you know what I mean

348
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,419
but um I'm sitting there and I really

349
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,580
have to toke that in you know I mean

350
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:07,269
that's not the case for everyone so

351
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:11,659
getting back to kind of the proprietary

352
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:13,670
pod and battery kind of compatibility

353
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,900
right because like your pod won't work

354
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:19,279
with a packs battery and vice versa

355
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,950
what are you kind of seeing in that game

356
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,720
I mean do you find it interesting that

357
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:28,549
there are all these companies coming out

358
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:34,069
with proprietary connections yeah it's

359
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:36,529
you know it's uh it's their one way of

360
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:38,269
cornering a certain market you know in

361
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:44,299
the packs don't get me wrong works well

362
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:47,450
but the fact that not every consumer can

363
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:51,589
pay $60 for a battery not every consumer

364
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:54,309
can pay $60 for a pod half gram at that

365
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:56,619
point not every consumer can do that

366
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:59,539
we're working with some companies that

367
00:17:56,619 --> 00:18:04,159
yes they're using one of our designs as

368
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:08,119
a proprietary system and you know

369
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,850
they're able to sell to consumers at $40

370
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:14,119
for a full gram and the battery will

371
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:16,609
last them for two days you know and

372
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:22,219
that's a big thing that's a big thing

373
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:25,639
you know tax has a market focus that

374
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,799
they're targeting they have an idea

375
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,030
they're executing it extremely well she

376
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:33,680
is doing the exact same thing so you

377
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:36,079
know we're just offering that solution

378
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,779
for brands like them or anyone that

379
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,329
aspires to be someone like that can

380
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:44,180
brands go on both platforms where do you

381
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:45,559
do is there like you got a sign with us

382
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,590
or with them

383
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:51,859
I don't know the specific details of

384
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:56,089
that but from what I understand you know

385
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:57,529
there are a few brands that do have two

386
00:18:56,089 --> 00:19:00,980
different devices for two different

387
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:03,740
purposes from different manufacturers

388
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,680
okay so you talked about how this is

389
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,660
still relevant technology wise but like

390
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:13,070
what's the improvement that this has

391
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:15,259
over kind of the traditional legacy so I

392
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:18,829
mean with this one are five ten

393
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:22,089
cartridges specifically you know with

394
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:25,460
five ten cartridges they're great but

395
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:27,799
most consumers aren't very careful with

396
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,840
a lot of their things you know with the

397
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,490
traditional pens you know sometimes you

398
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,250
put it in your back pocket you will sit

399
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,769
on it and it will snap you know we've

400
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,230
all seen it happen you drop it the glass

401
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:43,160
will break you lose your pressure you

402
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:45,650
lose your precious biomass you know with

403
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:49,250
the batteries and the pods you know the

404
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:53,540
pods are made out of PT EGC plastic so

405
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,890
it is a medical grade plastic so you

406
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:58,970
know if you are dropping this on the

407
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:01,430
floor the battery is gonna protect their

408
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,289
pot and in all reality if you drop your

409
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,750
pod it's not going to break on you and

410
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:08,389
shatter on you but but from a smoking

411
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:11,509
standpoint like is this one capable of

412
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:13,790
handling more variability in viscosity

413
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:16,640
than yeah minor like it definitely is

414
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:18,440
I've had clients of mine send videos of

415
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,320
them putting live resin into some of our

416
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,860
pods you know they're still working on

417
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:27,169
their aged it is not encouraged it is

418
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:29,809
not encouraged do experiment at your own

419
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:31,640
risk that's what I tell my clients but

420
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:33,169
you know that's where we see a lot of

421
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,570
the trend moving toward right now is

422
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,220
live resin but they're cutting the live

423
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,599
resin right now there are you know with

424
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,210
a lot of terpenes to get different

425
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:45,039
flavors and then you have your consumers

426
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:51,840
that want that true taste

427
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,839
some live resin right in front of you I

428
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:59,619
would definitely have to say the guy

429
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:02,560
that I'm using right now this has been

430
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:05,559
holding up pretty well but every mix

431
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,869
will be different one of our clients has

432
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:11,950
put live resin in this specific pod and

433
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:15,129
he has mixed it with different you know

434
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:18,610
liquidiser so either MCT Hunnicutt or

435
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,650
even terpenes i would assume if you're

436
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:23,019
doing live resin the last thing you want

437
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,850
to do is make sure that see sometimes

438
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:27,069
just a little bit goes a long way you

439
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:29,019
know I mean and everyone experiments on

440
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:32,049
a different level I mean how did we get

441
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:36,400
live resin it was out of a crazy idea

442
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:39,159
that he had to put it in dry ice right

443
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,690
and now look at where we're at with it

444
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:46,290
you know it's I mean how did electronic

445
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,340
cigarettes come to be you know

446
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:50,319
traditional analog cigarettes have been

447
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:52,990
around for so long and it's the same

448
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,089
thing with hand rolling it's been around

449
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:59,769
for so long it's been a standard for so

450
00:21:55,089 --> 00:22:01,480
long it took one person to say hey I

451
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:03,700
want to play Breaking Bad and I want to

452
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,910
try something crazy and now we have

453
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,340
distillate now we have live resin you

454
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:12,310
know it just takes one crazy experiment

455
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:14,859
to do and that one person can lead the

456
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:17,409
entire industry space into a completely

457
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:20,979
different direction yeah I mean who

458
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:24,550
would have thought 10 15 years ago that

459
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:30,130
we're gonna be at an event where we can

460
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:32,639
openly smoke and not be looked at in a

461
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,640
certain manner
