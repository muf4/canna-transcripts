2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:20,189
so many people are like starting to try

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,660
to tractor and mono crop cannabis say I

4
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,259
almost feel like on a certain level it's

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,750
almost an unformatted suit Eliza bull or

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,220
unlike corporate izybelle you know in a

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,710
certain way because you know although

8
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:33,659
there will be big farms that figure out

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,399
how to do it organically without the use

10
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,609
of pesticides it's a really difficult

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,170
plan to to know and to have a

12
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:41,700
relationship with and to control

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,170
especially as you're growing it on a

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,270
bigger level and so I think those that

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,219
try to go to big are the plants gonna

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,870
humble them out and like you know throw

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,620
them some broad nights or you know you

18
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:54,718
remember Vegas you know and you know new

19
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,238
s summit in all these places like you

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,448
show up at these VC combats and it's

21
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,488
like and it's like they're like look how

22
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:04,769
easy it is to grow cannabis and it's

23
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,840
like oh my machine you know it's like

24
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,270
here's you know watch this watch as

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,250
heaven we're mechanizing everything you

26
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,670
know and the idea is it's like who needs

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,200
first

28
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,329
they don't even cause VCS don't even

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,329
cause farmers it calls operators yeah

30
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,629
and that's why they're out of touch and

31
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,789
that's why they're not going to succeed

32
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:29,039
you know and we're seeing it daily these

33
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,630
people are coming in and saying I

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,450
thought there's a lot of money in this

35
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:34,269
music I make my money selling cannabis I

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,868
lose it

37
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:39,129
you know it's like like everyday because

38
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:41,590
there's something else that I'm doing

39
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:45,759
whether or not that's you know mortgage

40
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:47,049
or water palm tree or storage or you

41
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,180
know any of the various things I was

42
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:51,399
thinking life dedication so and that's

43
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,770
why it's really really important now

44
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,509
that these small micro branded farmers

45
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:57,670
get access to market it's really

46
00:01:55,509 --> 00:02:00,579
important how a good we don't come to a

47
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:03,640
market like this which is you know this

48
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:06,009
is this market is built on you know

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,199
relationship building principles right

50
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:11,530
so it's like this is so everyone can

51
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:14,439
meet everyone and it's really important

52
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,629
that let's say like a you're in here you

53
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,239
know offering testing packages to be one

54
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:22,659
and all that's going on that there's not

55
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,209
eight or ten different testing systems

56
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:27,219
going in that everyone's like well were

57
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,860
you tested and then there's a word like

58
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:32,019
you know there's a word for how you were

59
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,670
tested you're like oh well we don't want

60
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,379
your medicine no what we do want this

61
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:36,759
guy's met so we want this you know it's

62
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:38,530
like back but there needs to be some

63
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,759
type of the unified standard if we're

64
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,799
gonna gain consistency in the

65
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,989
marketplace and we're gonna have to

66
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:47,409
we're gonna have to also chip the word

67
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:49,299
quality from what the lab results are oh

68
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:51,039
yeah - you know I could what the actual

69
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:52,659
experience oh now we're talking about

70
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,000
that earlier I appreciate that it's like

71
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:57,969
it's like we had to move past lab

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,639
results you had to move into like how

73
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:03,109
the consumer is feeling it's like yes

74
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,839
make sure the consumer is not you know

75
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,660
smoking like crack please you know I

76
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,150
mean like let's hope yeah let's do that

77
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:13,310
right but then when we get into like the

78
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,520
actual quality when we talk quality

79
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,439
right it's not all sterile lab and fire

80
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,580
no no by no means no and then I

81
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,750
appreciate that you brought that up too

82
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,160
because you know I think I think one of

83
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,770
the big disservice --is that labs

84
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,599
actually brought into this community you

85
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,070
know in this lead-up to regulation where

86
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,319
there was really no demand of testing

87
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:31,849
you know as you know a lot of

88
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,560
dispensaries and a lot of people a lot

89
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,759
of patients kind of almost got

90
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,920
hoodwinked and thinking that highest

91
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,750
testing means best yeah you know and

92
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,030
that's so that's a highly highest

93
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,840
highest cannabinoid right yeah exactly

94
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,180
like you know it's like ya know it's and

95
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,009
it's such a box in yourself in such a

96
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,969
way with that and it's like and and you

97
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:52,189
know if you really want to get into

98
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:54,550
quality and start understanding like you

99
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:56,569
know testing um provide you know small

100
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,450
measurements to help in the overall

101
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,699
judging of quality you know and and you

102
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:03,769
know kind of identify and understand how

103
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,359
much terpenes play a role you know

104
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,219
because terpenes in such a big way how

105
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,190
much total terpene concentrations there

106
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:12,169
you know and how well you're able to

107
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:14,030
preserve these monoterpenes which pull

108
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,279
off at really low temperatures you know

109
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,790
it's like in such a big way are what

110
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,708
helped to you know to to show and give

111
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,650
tribute to how well that plant was grown

112
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,389
you know how well it was post harvested

113
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:29,569
and dried and cured because you know

114
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:31,610
just the slight bit of temperature all

115
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,689
of a sudden can like zap like you know

116
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,669
because anything you do from the time

117
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,759
you harvest the plant you know it's like

118
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:39,829
her pains are going away exponentially

119
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,168
and so it's like so so i think in a big

120
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:43,668
way like identifying utilizing terpenes

121
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:46,759
and understandings of how much terpenes

122
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:48,709
play a role in in judging affect they

123
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,800
can help you as a tool almost more than

124
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:53,478
the cannabinoids you know as you know to

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,490
incorporate into this metric of you know

126
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:57,829
helping to you know like almost like a

127
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,478
wine grading system you know because

128
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:01,550
like there are two metrics in this

129
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:03,560
twenty one kind of point matrix of like

130
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,680
judging quality from like terroir and

131
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,660
soil and kind of

132
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,728
you know like you know nutrient kind of

133
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,280
regiments and like um you know how well

134
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:12,990
how you know just these different you

135
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,978
know quality indicators new because you

136
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,478
know how well something was dried and

137
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:16,379
cured out you know the bag appeal you

138
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:17,969
know all these things that you know

139
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:20,310
qualitatively play a major role in

140
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,080
judging quality you know whereas the

141
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,459
quantitative things like cannabis you

142
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,469
know like testing well you know yeah

143
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,689
pesticide testing certain things to show

144
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,330
and distinguish like that something is

145
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:32,219
you know of quality and it doesn't have

146
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,599
any public health risk components but

147
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,060
then you know terpenes of cannabinoids

148
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,639
are more like you know I like to

149
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,199
describe them as almost like they're the

150
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,819
data points to help provide a language

151
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,410
of meaning and understanding to help

152
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:45,389
incorporate into your understanding of

153
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,860
judging quality and also navigating

154
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:48,810
affect in so many ways

155
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,330
it's not about highest THC or highest

156
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,280
CBD or it's like you know the the I

157
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:55,978
think it's such a magical aspect of this

158
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,329
plant is is how it diverse it is across

159
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:58,168
the different strains and you know when

160
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,639
it really comes down to it the

161
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:01,319
cannabinoids are almost you know the

162
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,538
ratio of cannabinoids are well

163
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,279
ultimately are gonna be most effective

164
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:07,620
for treating certain disease or disorder

165
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:11,279
you know it's like one to one THC the

166
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,949
CBD is most effective now from GW

167
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,948
pharmaceutical research from all the you

168
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,538
know kind of anecdotal of patient trials

169
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:19,680
and feedback you know one to one seem is

170
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:22,199
most effective for multiple sclerosis

171
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,269
you know and so then whether or not it's

172
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,069
a one-to-one with high Turpin lean or

173
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:28,379
one-to-one with high Mir seen is gonna

174
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,060
then help to so it's like okay my wonder

175
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,788
one for my mouth cirrhosis now I want to

176
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,439
look for much sedative varietal so it'll

177
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:37,259
be Mir seen or I'm gonna look for a more

178
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:39,139
creative inspiring cerebral which is the

179
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,939
Turpin alene you know and so do you love

180
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,460
exactly so and and and that's really

181
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,750
important in identifying Appalachians

182
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:47,969
right because when you talk about

183
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,259
testing for terpene we talk about the

184
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,750
full expression write the word

185
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,158
expression comes in it's like how is the

186
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,199
plant expressing yourself full it's like

187
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:57,408
there's my Sour Diesel expressing itself

188
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,300
fullest about

189
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:01,188
you know anything like that's it it

190
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,960
expresses itself like water and whether

191
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,899
it's going indoor outdoor certain we see

192
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,658
we see in certain areas certain strains

193
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:10,369
show you know like huge express more

194
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:12,259
concentrated amounts and certain more

195
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:14,089
terpenes you know kind of show up in

196
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:15,800
more amounts you know whenever it's gone

197
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:19,368
under the Sun versus if the same plants

198
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,929
growing in door yeah you know I'm just

199
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:22,819
you know just I'm the most basic example

200
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:25,248
he blue dream what's really interesting

201
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:28,158
is a blue dream so blue dreams typically

202
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:31,309
a mere same dominant alpha pining Co

203
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:33,139
dominant strain and whenever the same

204
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:34,729
plants grown outside you see alpha

205
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,158
pining almost double and become

206
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:39,709
codominant or oftentimes like slightly

207
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:41,569
more dominant than the mere seen and so

208
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,278
so I think certain terpenes like pining

209
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,009
might have the ability when growing

210
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:48,199
outdoor to produce themselves and much

211
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:50,119
more significant concentrations but but

212
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,769
then overall to just total terpene

213
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:54,289
concentration you know like you were

214
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:56,689
just pointing out this Rd it's like can

215
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:59,269
Saturday as a genetic get its full

216
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:00,649
potential and its expression whenever

217
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:03,709
it's grown in a slightly improper

218
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:06,709
environment that doesn't allow it the

219
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:08,059
ability to finish off and to to explode

220
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:10,879
out the last bit of Turkey and

221
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:13,069
concentration you know and so I mean I

222
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,149
think you know any you know any of its

223
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,278
gonna be amazing you know as long as

224
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:17,959
it's tried and cured well but but just

225
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:19,338
to really see the way that certain

226
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:21,588
appellation is it growing you know

227
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:23,569
certain you know environmental

228
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:24,978
conditions you know when that plant pops

229
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,588
and then when you see it's chirping

230
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:30,938
total concentration like you know forty

231
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:30,939
percent higher than what it was

232
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:48,449
