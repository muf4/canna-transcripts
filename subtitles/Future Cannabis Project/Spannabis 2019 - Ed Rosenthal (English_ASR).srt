1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,580
hey guys Lance Lambert here coming to

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:08,638
you from Barcelona Spain for spannabis

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,589
2019 opsin it's getting really smoky

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,579
around here and it could be because I

5
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:18,179
mean it's literally almost 4:20 but also

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:20,640
because we've got v1 the only the man

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,070
the myth the legend we've got ed

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,289
Rosenthal here with us how're you doing

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,109
that nice

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:31,230
so beyond being a good friend and a

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,390
fellow in the industry I want to get ed

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,000
on camera and just get his take on Spain

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,969
so tell me this isn't your first rodeo

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,929
you've been here before yeah yeah what

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,579
have you seen

16
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:43,378
I think we've talked do you like

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,390
Barcelona I think it's a nice city you

18
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:47,488
know how much have you seen this place

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,520
change in the last several years

20
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:53,159
well it's grown tremendously and it's

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:59,520
much more sophisticated than it was just

22
00:00:53,159 --> 00:01:07,649
a few years ago very similar to be to

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:10,260
some American shows that and what do you

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,618
think I mean this is you mentioned like

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,689
a us shows giving Canadian shows but us

26
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,790
shows more so where it's either business

27
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:20,279
to business or consumer but here

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,409
especially in Europe it seems they

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,280
overlap the two right I mean it's just a

30
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,280
common thing

31
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,409
well well I think that the American

32
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:43,859
industry is more segmented right now

33
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:47,849
yeah but I think that there is that in

34
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:51,510
America right now the grower is has been

35
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:54,569
left behind trouble at the shows and I

36
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:57,320
think that that will change because

37
00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:01,228
there is a growing demand for cannabis

38
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:03,179
very true are you so what is your take

39
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:06,959
you know how things are here more than

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,840
anyone social clubs versus coffee shops

41
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:13,560
and the Netherlands vs. us only having

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,909
dispensaries in the US and Canada what's

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,849
your take on the social club do you

44
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:21,620
think that's a good model for Main

45
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:24,569
Street per se I think that coffee that

46
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,069
so she's loved the coffee shop for the

47
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:30,039
both good models

48
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:36,878
we have that in California now that we

49
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:39,459
have yeah right so I mean that's the

50
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,310
thing I think about its domestic

51
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,530
international how many pubs and clubs

52
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,049
that you pass where alcohol is is

53
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,000
obviously the the European option for

54
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:52,329
consumption but for those that rather

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,128
consume cannabis not alcohol just top

56
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:56,889
right I mean just so many places where

57
00:02:54,128 --> 00:03:01,239
there is a communal opportunity or

58
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:04,989
social opportunity it's really difficult

59
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:09,430
to have a pub type scene or it has been

60
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:14,709
before the cannabis clubs after an

61
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:17,310
opening and I think that that only a

62
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,310
healthy

63
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:25,000
really healthy phenomenon and the reason

64
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:28,300
why said the usual care of healthy

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,189
they're drinking a lot for social

66
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,660
drinking which often leads

67
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:36,579
overindulgence is really good for people

68
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,889
yeah I'm not saying you to be outlawed

69
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,410
or kind of the other people but people

70
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:44,500
should at least be given a choice and

71
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:46,810
that's what yeah I agree with that too

72
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,680
so what else what do you think is the

73
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,449
the future of cannabis on a global scale

74
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,219
I think a good question asked me and

75
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:58,109
that work and kind of the epicenter of

76
00:03:54,219 --> 00:04:03,579
Europe right now right well I think that

77
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:08,830
happening all room and both in South

78
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:13,720
America Central America and then over

79
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:16,970
and here here you know each country has

80
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:20,478
its own laws yeah

81
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:23,720
also in Malaysia they just came out they

82
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:29,598
trade up there was going to they could

83
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:32,659
execute a person who was giving kids THC

84
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:35,360
and CBD for epilepsy and there was such

85
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:36,500
broadcast with the change in belonging

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,509
Wow

87
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,709
and that's something you not expect in

88
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:43,538
Malaysia because they're up there with

89
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:43,538
Singapore on capital punishment in crime

90
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,519
well that's a good segue you know

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,199
something that happened is I'd say gift

92
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,589
over the holidays we weren't expecting

93
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,939
but for Thailand in South Korea to

94
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,258
announce it there and move forward a

95
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:02,598
medical I mean is that something that

96
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,949
you imagined in your lifetime I don't I

97
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:05,598
don't even know if I imagined Asia

98
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,400
coming around to cannabis even though

99
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:09,680
that's a better part of where this all

100
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:13,250
began I guess you can say but what's

101
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,800
your take on that surely the ruling

102
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,589
closes

103
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,829
appreciate it but I think that the

104
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:24,008
medical thing is not a trip some people

105
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:26,800
because marijuana is a medicine and it

106
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:29,220
can help people and we would want to

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,879
keep people from their matters yeah

108
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,770
makes sense well I as always appreciated

109
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,319
add as a friend and a colleague in the

110
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:40,568
industry you know you really are in my

111
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,270
eyes you are a true legend you bring so

112
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:45,400
much you have so much history and it's

113
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:46,779
so utterly important for that to be

114
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,399
continued and carry through into the

115
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,500
future so I thank you for your time

116
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,189
definitely appreciate it enjoy your

117
