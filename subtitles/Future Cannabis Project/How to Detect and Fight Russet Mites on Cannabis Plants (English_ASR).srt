2
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:17,039
rustle mites are toxic to the plant

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,948
different than a normal might so a

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:24,929
normal mite basically drains a plant of

5
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:27,810
its SAP and dehydrates it look like a

6
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,528
little baby vampire tick flea think of

7
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:32,368
it like that

8
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:35,539
a russet light would be more like like a

9
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:39,628
brown recluse bite where where it has

10
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:42,149
toxins that kill the plant and thin it

11
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:44,039
out so what you see is in vegetative

12
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,009
growth you'll see plants that suddenly

13
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,710
look where where the stem is on the new

14
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:51,948
growth look half thickness of the old

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,878
growth and you you almost

16
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:55,679
characteristically see incredible leaf

17
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,738
roll-up as if it was a magnesium

18
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:01,289
deficiency and you you notice a very

19
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,030
paling in color almost like it's a zinc

20
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,450
iron deficiency so you see all these

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,250
weird little signs and none of them

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,079
would be present normally and all of a

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,060
sudden you start to see them

24
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,769
you'll typically see these problems in

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,299
the lower Leafs first because russets

26
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:17,429
usually come in from the bottom and come

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,649
up but the bottom line is if it's

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,420
wind-borne which I know it had to have

29
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,770
been on my farm they only end there on

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,070
the top of the dam plant they'll land

31
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:28,469
that all over the plant and so we looked

32
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:30,719
for these damages now in vegetative as

33
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,159
you can see it and if it's in vegetative

34
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,929
I think sulfur couldn't be a better

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,969
choice because for us as cannabis

36
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,710
farmers what the prices were facing the

37
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,659
idea of using extremely expensive

38
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:42,929
control methodologies is really not

39
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,909
applicable and and I like in a something

40
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,100
knock enzymatic so I like enzymatic and

41
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,228
they work well if one understands how to

42
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:50,969
use it and if one understands that they

43
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:53,250
are rough on the epidural layer of

44
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,989
plants just like sulfur can be so both

45
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,790
of them can chew up a plan a little bit

46
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:59,310
but the sulfur is exceptionally cost

47
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,680
effective you just can't use sulfur in

48
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,269
flour it will it will flavor the

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,340
cannabis and it will flavor the extract

50
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:07,289
so sulfur is something you can't use

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,060
once we're in the flour but all through

52
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,280
that you Tator purpose is fantastic

53
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,800
fantastic miticide to an absolutely

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,590
aggressive on all insects and can you do

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,340
it while sunlight is on the planet or

56
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,319
just go in the morning

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,939
also all sprays should be done in the

58
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,449
morning when the plant has it heated up

59
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,329
chemically

60
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,409
and you can lay this on and just follow

61
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,040
your

62
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:31,000
IPM programs the problem with these and

63
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,579
sulfur is if you mix it with like an

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,810
agricultural oil and they start to

65
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,730
become aggressive on the leaf surface

66
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,890
when you using sulfur you have to really

67
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:42,099
agitated material otherwise it comes out

68
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:44,349
in in too much of a heavy chunk and so

69
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:47,049
enzyme acts can believe you leave sulfur

70
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:48,459
can bleach you life passing bicarbonate

71
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,110
which you use powdery mildew the same

72
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,959
thing if you don't shake that up enough

73
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,730
it will leave each and so while products

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,950
having to have a phyto toxicity to a

75
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:57,939
degree if it's too concentrated but

76
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:59,409
ultimately you know potassium

77
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:03,400
bicarbonate could be any cheaper to use

78
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:05,829
for powdery mildew patrol and sulfur

79
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,250
couldn't be any cheaper to use as a anti

80
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,810
fungicide and pest control but once we

81
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,189
get into flower not to me the only thing

82
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,560
that you really want to work with air is

83
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:15,579
pronation and predation as I said is

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,409
really simple it's just what you're

85
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,180
gonna do is you can talk to your bug

86
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:22,000
company and you're gonna tell them what

87
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,560
your fire mental conditions are and if

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,639
it's indoor/outdoor and these things

89
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,590
really make a difference in the

90
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,139
reproductive rates quantity and delivery

91
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:33,250
and so because entomology study bugs are

92
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:34,929
so complex I I always work with a bug

93
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,560
supplier so you find one that you want

94
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,659
to work with my guys out Oregon and he's

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,640
my consultant on it what we do is we've

96
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:47,109
just had him come in and help us

97
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:48,639
understand pest IPM and then we run by

98
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:50,680
him you know what weren't working with

99
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,539
and anything new in the world because

100
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,599
remember people breed these bugs create

101
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:57,209
these books for these purposes and as

102
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,009
as pathogens change the bugs needed

103
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,930
change and if you're in a situation

104
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:02,370
where it's colder and wetter you need

105
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,069
something different than a predator that

106
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,629
likes it hotter and drier and so this is

107
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:10,799
a speciality this isn't where you just

108
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:12,629
go grab some a couple of which I say

109
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,460
ladybugs from the local store and just

110
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,509
throw them in your grow room it's not

111
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,489
that simple

112
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:18,930
but it's really that simple once you get

113
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:21,479
down to it where you're just applying

114
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,009
living pronation to do the work and then

115
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,990
what you have is you have plants that

116
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:27,779
are not covered with any kind of product

117
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,550
at all so now you can really sell these

118
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,719
plants in the concentrate market which

119
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,670
for a lot of people is where a lot of

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,500
this should be going because the the

121
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,939
concentrate markets a huge market and

122
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,740
for a lot of people that have bought

123
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:39,899
cannabis that no longer has a black

124
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,720
market value and it's got a very slow

125
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:44,459
white market value it has an excellent

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,500
value and concentrate if it can be made

127
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,299
into concentrate so everybody keeps

128
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,279
talking about this eight times increase

129
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,629
of cannabis in California where the

130
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,609
legal market has got eight times the

131
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:55,709
amount of poverty eight times the amount

132
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,629
of clean pot so if eighty eight percent

133
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:59,759
of the cannabis in California is

134
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:02,759
considered dirty and unsellable is only

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,050
12% of the total exists well twelve

136
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,399
times eighty to ninety six that comes

137
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,199
already back up to hundred again so I

138
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,569
don't I don't think we have eight times

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,860
the cannabis in the state that people

140
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,589
think we do I think they have eight

141
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,689
times too much pot but not cannabis not

142
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:18,379
medical grade Kim is not food grade

143
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:20,660
cannabis not testable cannabis

144
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:22,699
and so the whole point of this is to get

145
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,130
the farmers to be able to get a product

146
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,180
it makes it through these tests because

147
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:27,920
these tests they're gonna hold your

148
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,900
batch it's not gonna be where in the

149
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,850
past you could take a sample and if you

150
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:34,159
failed well then you could go and find

151
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,260
another source for that cannabis but as

152
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,480
we go forward the distributors will hold

153
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:40,789
the batch lot and then the test

154
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,400
invalidates the batch lot and now you

155
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,230
have a batch lot that's invalidating and

156
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:47,049
the state will make you take it off your

157
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:50,210
inventory on all your track and trace

158
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:53,150
the the majority of individuals who are

159
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:55,279
in cannabis do not really understand

160
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:57,079
what regulative regulated cannabis is

161
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,609
they're all 215 dies and they sell into

162
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,349
the dispensary they're not running

163
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,509
anything legal in any way shape or form

164
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,820
in terms of unreal evils a transaction

165
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:06,379
the real transactions are gonna occur

166
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,939
through a highly regulated track and

167
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:10,490
trace methodology that's gonna be able

168
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:12,290
to hold batches and then determine these

169
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,910
batches are no longer good these batches

170
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,290
will have batch Lots if the batch makes

171
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,450
it through the system it comes out dirty

172
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,260
they'll go back and track it you'll be

173
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,509
held liable

174
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,789
they'll be class-action lawsuits cuz all

175
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:23,990
the states of follow suit with this so

176
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,670
this is something that you've got to be

177
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,800
crystal clear about you want to create

178
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,629
products that have nothing on them that

179
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,900
will cause you problems or the people

180
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:34,490
problems because it's above morale it's

181
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:36,469
it's a legal issue now so for people

182
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,300
whose morality is a little askew or

183
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,860
their wallets gonna be a little askew

184
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,579
too so one of those should get you back

185
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,100
on track

186
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:44,359
so with Russert mites what are some of

187
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,330
the

188
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,699
ways that fighting Russert mites can

189
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:51,529
make your cannabis dirty can you talk

190
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:54,949
about so you're saying sulfur is safe to

191
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:56,628
use only up until only up until flower

192
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,610
most people try to use just different

193
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:00,560
pesticides that you can use it Russell

194
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,939
mites aren't hard to kill pesticide so

195
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,280
there's a tremendous different number of

196
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:06,560
families of pesticides that one can use

197
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,848
that are all available illegally

198
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,288
everybody if you're a grower you know

199
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:11,810
how to get illegal pesticides because it

200
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:14,329
then are hard to get and any of those

201
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,740
families of illegal pesticides work in

202
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:17,000
the Bob and now I'm not gonna tell you

203
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,728
which ones to use because then you're

204
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,918
gonna go use sulfur and beneficials is

205
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:23,449
what you need to know and and enzymatic

206
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,848
sif you're able to work with that also

207
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:28,520
though that's those are good strategies

208
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:31,550
the main point is that you have to be

209
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,049
highly vigilant on your plan and I think

210
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,728
for a lot of individuals when you're

211
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,949
running new cultivars you don't know

212
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:39,019
what to expect so you start to see

213
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,728
changes in performance and you don't

214
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:43,728
know if it's what's supposed to happen

215
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:45,378
and I think that in the test plants in

216
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:47,538
plants we don't know is where we get the

217
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:49,400
problems first because we don't see it

218
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:50,959
quickly so plants that you're most

219
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,638
familiar with you'll be able to do an

220
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,568
AED on and if you're really doing what

221
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,860
you're supposed to be doing which is

222
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:56,960
actually keeping an eye on the crop

223
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,669
you're walking through your fields and

224
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,859
you're look at the changes and if

225
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:02,919
everything looks the same then it's easy

226
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,379
to see what doesn't match what

227
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,390
we'll do a shoddy job and everything

228
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:09,639
looks different and then one can't find

229
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:12,279
the unusual one has to find something

230
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,050
that is just different when everything's

231
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:16,029
different is impossible so if you're

232
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,790
doing a good garden and practice where

233
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,659
you standardize on what are you doing

234
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,790
then what's going to happen is you're

235
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,370
gonna be able to go through and infinite

236
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,800
veg you'll start to see this change in

237
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,970
the apical tips of your plants where

238
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,520
they literally look like they're

239
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,950
radically thinner and smaller and tailor

240
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,779
with extreme zinc and iron and AG

241
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,610
deficiency all in one shot

242
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,959
and you're gonna go there's no way I

243
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,360
have this problem because the rest of

244
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,470
the plant looks great at that point you

245
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,330
got to get yourself a good quality

246
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,250
microscope loops and get down into these

247
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,050
leaves and start remember they go there

248
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,570
all the russets and broads they hide in

249
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:50,829
the node so they borrow so they're tough

250
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,870
to see and they move quickly so you

251
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,340
almost can never see the bug itself but

252
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,799
what you'll see is little silicon

253
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,450
nodules at their egg sacs so if you can

254
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,799
find some you can find the damage and

255
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,379
then flip the leaves and look for these

256
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:04,959
little trails of egg you clearly know

257
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:06,669
and as soon as you see that top growth

258
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,650
don't think you're having a nutrient

259
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:11,589
problem where did it suddenly happen it

260
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:14,409
wouldn't you would not go from full

261
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:16,060
health to no health overnight and it's

262
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:19,000
quick this is happen all period like a

263
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:21,979
week or two you've seen a sudden change

264
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,828
slowly happening it happens quick and

265
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,509
then you have to respond to it if you

266
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:28,789
can respond to it you can get the plant

267
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:30,828
to get this toxin out of its system

268
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:33,110
through more vegetative growth and maybe

269
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:34,699
we only get in a heavy infestation only

270
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,990
half of what we were gonna get a third

271
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,120
or what we're gonna get but it's better

272
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,159
than none and I think that the farmers

273
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,230
have to see that but once they are aware

274
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,360
of that this is something that exists in

275
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,180
the world you just know that you should

276
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,980
be spraying your vegetative plants and

277
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:52,189
keep them a healthy as an inoculation as

278
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,899
IPM and then you treat the flowering

279
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,630
plants like I said with the beneficials

280
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:58,309
the whole time and if you see you know a

281
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,958
wave that come in because you have an

282
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:01,879
infestation at a neighbor's garden then

283
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,979
we can add adults but you only don't

284
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,809
drive that adults and juveniles trying

285
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,879
to do a protection the juveniles all you

286
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:10,039
have to add the adults come out free

287
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:11,480
hungry so they're ravenous and so

288
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,309
they'll just a population up with the

289
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,039
juveniles and release over the course of

290
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:18,319
a month out of a sack of Satchel it'll

291
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:21,349
basically look like a dryer sheet the

292
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,420
little hook and inside them

293
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,860
different types of mites exist different

294
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:26,009
over the predator bugs depending on what

295
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,169
we're trying to kill

296
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:30,120
you hang these on the plant about six to

297
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,039
eight inches off the bottom so this way

298
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,840
as they release they move up and start

299
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:37,199
to colonize through the plant chasing

300
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,300
the rustle and well we know as we go

301
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,100
forward we'll find better methods to

302
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,019
deal with all this biologically speaking

303
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,139
but right now it's pretty much

304
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,699
equivalent to the fire so the russet

305
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,129
probably took out as much cannabis as

306
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,280
the fire stood out this year Oh easy

307
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:54,990
yeah he's back to talking more about why

308
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,329
the russet might has been such a big

309
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,899
problem this year and are you seeing

310
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,110
that throughout southern Humboldt County

311
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,459
rustling

312
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,930
everywhere it's off to California now

313
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,030
it's been it's been spread every time

314
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:08,009
russet my total the United States it

315
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,539
because because plants move all over the

316
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:11,009
United States so people have rusted on

317
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:12,269
Endor all over the place now

318
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:13,779
because that's a it's a buffered

319
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:15,639
environment

320
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:18,220
you have rusted all of them and though

321
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,720
all of humble a lot of it is it's in all

322
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,490
the neighborhood gardens who has where

323
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,290
that's what I see most where you have

324
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,830
all everybody who has a home garden in

325
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:26,259
the yard

326
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,210
russet lights came through so they come

327
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:31,299
in through some air other plants that

328
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:34,540
came it easy

329
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:35,679
typically no see I don't find and I

330
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:36,669
don't and I'm not saying thanks I have a

331
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,750
nursery because I don't think the

332
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:39,759
russets are coming from everybody's

333
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,080
nursery so sometimes yeah some russets

334
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,419
might be coming from a nursery but you

335
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,370
would damn well know you had russet at

336
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:47,979
your nursery because what is Rusted

337
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,419
prevent propagation so if the mothers

338
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,080
are covered in russets they're not

339
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:55,870
striking roots so it's hard to have a

340
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,520
russet mite infestation and sell the

341
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,990
russet mite clones because you're not

342
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,779
gonna produce any russet like clones

343
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:04,240
because they don't want to root so you

344
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:06,250
end up having pathogens that might get

345
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,930
on the clones themselves but typically

346
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,059
if the mothers are infested with russet

347
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:12,489
mites they don't want to strike a room

348
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:14,889
and so what I know is that that's how we

349
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,509
learn what these working initial like

350
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:18,610
abroad whites in another nursery

351
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:20,830
probably nine years ago then they go fly

352
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,750
on Thurman nursery and it completely

353
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,009
changed the propagation rates and that's

354
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,339
how we knew it wiped out an entire

355
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:30,129
operation so what we know is that if we

356
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:31,990
use IPM correctly and we use in sulfurs

357
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:33,519
and when using frases online the nursery

358
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,990
here to the frass is good for all of my

359
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,338
vitamin X then we compost tea it brew it

360
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,720
up so we get a little concentrated and

361
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,220
then we just foliar spray the whole

362
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,470
facility with it every couple days and

363
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,580
set frass works really well on most eggs

364
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,070
and software you kill anything else but

365
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,910
the mic problems are predominantly

366
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:56,580
people are not aware of this problem and

367
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:57,839
so most growers are growers but does

368
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,580
that mean that you're a professional

369
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,810
farmer you know you got Tomatoes in your

370
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,509
backyard does that mean you have an AG

371
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:05,219
degree I mean you know identify that and

372
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:07,289
you don't need an Ag degree to identify

373
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,580
but are you that involved so like

374
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:10,679
ultimately what is your level of

375
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,920
involvement in the thing you're in most

376
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,659
people with cannabis 20% involvement you

377
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,829
don't have a full time involvement

378
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,029
you're gonna come to your patch and go

379
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,710
wow I don't know what's wrong with it

380
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,750
then a week later you go what's dying

381
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,580
and then a week later x' died and then

382
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,500
you go I got russet like so then you go

383
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,470
online to the crop that's in 20%

384
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,210
infestation and the the news is to burn

385
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,500
it to the ground and kill every plant

386
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,519
and burn it and I'm laughing I'm like

387
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,720
and you're gonna burn your neighbor's

388
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,000
crop too and you're gonna burn that with

389
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,440
the world around you anybody tells you

390
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,970
to burn your crop and they given you

391
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,250
some horrible advice that maybe they'll

392
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,750
share their property what you want to do

393
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,940
is you want to fight the problem and I'm

394
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,830
telling you organic organic biology can

395
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,150
really control this to a degree you just

396
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,560
have to be able to spend the money to do

397
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,740
it and that's where you're gonna have to

398
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:55,619
figure out is the cost worth what you're

399
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,049
about to grow a lose and I just think

400
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,600
that as these problems become more and

401
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:01,829
more prevalent people become smarter and

402
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,379
smarter at how they deal with them

403
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:06,150
you'll be able to understand what to

404
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,340
you don't see a lot of the issues that

405
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,509
we saw prior you know I say the powdery

406
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,769
mildew issues don't seem to be so

407
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:12,809
prevalent because people started to

408
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:14,189
learn how to grow algae they started to

409
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:16,829
realize that you can't grow it in North

410
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:19,380
slopes you can't grow it in shady areas

411
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:21,300
if you overfeed it it'll get p.m. if you

412
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:22,830
debit and you don't vent it it'll get

413
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:25,169
p.m. and so pretty soon people started

414
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,450
venting the depth they started they

415
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:29,129
started lack of both feeding and they

416
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,440
don't grow OG in situations where you're

417
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:33,059
gonna get pathogenic issues and so lo

418
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,860
and behold the amount of OG that's

419
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:37,349
available this year that isn't fungally

420
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,029
in fact that it's clean is high because

421
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,290
twenty years have to grown in the

422
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,959
cultivar people kind of figured out what

423
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:44,519
to do so what you're gonna do is you're

424
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,080
gonna have the same thing with russet is

425
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,809
it the people in 20 years will figure

426
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,000
out we know what to do with it and the

427
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:52,769
easier the solution the less people want

428
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,049
to take it because if it's kicking their

429
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:56,669
ass it must be really complicated and

430
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:59,819
it's really not it's just this is what

431
00:14:56,669 --> 00:15:01,289
you got to do you got to work on and we

432
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,790
figured out we went we tried a lot of

433
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:04,379
different methods but I'm really happy

434
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:05,969
with what we've done this year and I

435
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:08,220
like the fact that the nursery is able

436
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,960
to contain all the issues I had Russ had

437
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,660
come in here one year my CBD bed and

438
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,460
it's same thing you're born you write in

439
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:15,870
all the airport wind-borne blew in from

440
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,060
somewhere someone had a truckload of

441
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,220
something in dirt maybe knows but it

442
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:21,929
blew in and gut in the building and we

443
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,790
saw it on those CVB's and that's where I

444
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:26,099
know that I said listen I'm gonna attack

445
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,870
this thing agriculturally I'm gonna

446
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,000
knock it out with sulfur and we blasted

447
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,220
it out blast it out of the building

448
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,269
never to come back and I challenge

449
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,920
people come through the loop and find

450
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:36,689
there's no rust in the damn building we

451
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:38,399
wiped it out of the building and we

452
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,620
wiped it off those cultivars because

453
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,889
we're gonna burn the building down like

454
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,440
really you know so you

455
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:48,080
tools to use and what you're gonna find

456
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,900
is like for me personally I noticed that

457
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,230
the issues are primarily we plants that

458
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:56,659
are older so what I saw myself was that

459
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,340
in plants that had the most infestation

460
00:15:56,659 --> 00:16:01,100
it was older cultivars meaning you know

461
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,600
stuff in the 90s things have been you

462
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,330
know cotton cotton cotton cotton cotton

463
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,220
cotton cotton cotton cotton and if you

464
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,960
chose cultivars that have low vigor so

465
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,160
sometimes some cultivars are poorly

466
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,780
chosen where they legally have the

467
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,759
product but this should've went through

468
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:16,909
another 150 seeds and found the one that

469
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,769
also grew heartily and those are prone

470
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,059
so if the immune system even though

471
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,370
plants technically don't have one but

472
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:25,789
let's just use it as a way to explain it

473
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:28,009
the immune system is reduced then this

474
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:30,589
problem is real so in plants that are

475
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:32,929
healthy and solid they can fight it with

476
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,000
very little help and plants that are

477
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:36,739
compromised they don't do well at all

478
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,539
and so what that means is that on your

479
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,310
strain list just whatever got hammered

480
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,899
this year don't grow next year just

481
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:44,929
realize that that's how you approach it

482
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:46,789
in Ag there's weather the market wants

483
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:49,549
it or not if it can't be produced the

484
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:50,329
market can't have it and so that's just

485
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,740
how it is

486
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,780
someone else will produce it where they

487
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,310
can you need to find what works for you

488
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,289
in your garden works for you in your

489
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:59,629
environment and and

490
00:16:57,289 --> 00:17:02,059
and predation and control of these

491
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:03,948
pathogens is part of that what works for

492
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:06,259
you where you're at and what can you use

493
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:08,029
then that makes it so important I'd

494
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,318
rather have cultivars II didn't need the

495
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:11,480
help because that's just more money I

496
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:14,058
have to keep spending and when pounds

497
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,179
were a lot more valuable I don't think

498
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:19,160
anybody even cared I mean just spend the

499
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:20,689
money you're seeing people breaking out

500
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,009
calculators right now for the first time

501
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:24,620
on the phone they go to the gross store

502
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:26,480
so my little purpose on this this whole

503
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:27,678
time is to meet agriculturally efficient

504
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,569
because that way we were able to

505
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,160
actually survive so I would recommend

506
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:33,048
all people to really look at it from

507
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,540
that perspective take a look at how you

508
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:37,429
would approach this from food grade food

509
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:41,359
production because the needs are the

510
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:42,470
same and just go that route anything

511
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,159
else do you think people should know

512
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:48,710
about russet might a lot of area I think

513
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,400
it's pretty good you it's you got it the

514
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,769
be diligent and be proactive and when

515
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,440
you do have it man be reactive move your

516
00:17:54,769 --> 00:18:07,639
feet

517
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:07,640
