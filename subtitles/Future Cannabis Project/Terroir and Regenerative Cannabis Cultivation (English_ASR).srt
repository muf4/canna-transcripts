[Music]

2
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:10,410
No until recently like last couple years

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,580
that this was even the thing with Oh our

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:18,420
resumes are huge that's okay cool and

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,300
then it's like sometimes I see it in

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,179
people who live in our you know a night

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,368
but I don't know what all the factors

8
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,070
are if it's just that if it has to do

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,320
with the Sun to do with our soil the

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,570
soil some sort of combination of things

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:39,179
maybe because the UV intensity because

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:41,189
you know in our Valley area you know

13
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:45,299
like it's just hard to say I could be a

14
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:50,578
lot of factors it's pretty intense in

15
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:54,089
the summer yeah it's like it's but it's

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,920
almost desert like in the valley it's

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,480
very interesting because like you go out

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,859
on the river plane where where I kind of

19
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,089
right on the edge and yeah if you go out

20
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,780
there in the middle of the day in the

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,460
summer itself the desert feels like and

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,989
you're on these edge of that and we're

23
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:14,728
on the edge of that and then on the

24
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:17,250
other side of that is a little more

25
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:20,280
yeah more on the other on the coastal

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:24,359
side of the mountain is definitely

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:28,379
higher rainfall for sure so we're kind

28
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:30,239
of in a banana boat well it's

29
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,158
interesting to explore there's so many

30
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,828
there's a lot of variables we'd have to

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,368
really really do it me like yeah to know

32
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:41,008
for sure I I don't think it's cultivar

33
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:43,170
specific because we have seen the same

34
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,149
cultivars you know they're not

35
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,228
necessarily look that way whether other

36
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:53,819
people have done the same exact cutting

37
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:58,140
or seed stock or anything it's so it's

38
00:01:53,819 --> 00:02:00,299
not necessarily that but I think it must

39
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,079
be a combination

40
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:07,380
it's not one yeah I don't think there's

41
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:10,618
one reason unless I think a lot of it

42
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:16,189
you know has to do with with the natural

43
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:19,199
farming - I think cannabis and likes

44
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:33,259
being harmed this way you know and I

45
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:35,759
think it responds - yeah I have I think

46
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:37,439
you know likes being farm naturally I've

47
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,818
noticed with a lot of the natural

48
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,889
farmers they have their wheat is like an

49
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:47,280
expression of their place in a different

50
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:49,379
way you know what I mean like there's a

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,598
lot of the weed that are just like oh

52
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:54,780
this is commercial weed you know what I

53
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,068
mean it's all the same but everybody who

54
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,348
does natural farming there's like a

55
00:02:56,068 --> 00:03:00,359
something special about it because it's

56
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:05,149
their connection to their land and it's

57
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,150
their own unique creativity and it's

58
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,569
solutrean that's their that's the thing

59
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,959
is there's a lot of style to it it's

60
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:19,039
like there's a lot of art to it and and

61
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,140
so I mean you're not you're never gonna

62
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,139
see the same thing twice in any

63
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,458
performance and the flowers have their

64
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:28,099
performance - and we're just

65
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,840
collaborating with them but but

66
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:32,629
ultimately when you're really letting

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,348
the flowers and the biological

68
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:40,849
intelligence of the soil and of the land

69
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:42,768
express itself then I mean amazing

70
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:45,199
things keep happening they're evolving

71
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:48,349
as they're they're evolving for us to

72
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,719
select from their amazingness you know

73
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:52,729
so like we're just we're just the people

74
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,189
at the end of the day they get to be

75
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:56,869
like oh I want come on out one like that

76
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:59,419
one and they're the ones really

77
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,890
dictating their own evolution and people

78
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:03,889
are really receiving a lot of amazing

79
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:06,679
test results coming generator starts you

80
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:11,048
know like where it's like 30 plus

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,049
percent they're like total cannabinoids

82
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:22,750
you know above 35 total skandhas

83
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:27,379
cannabinoids a mere 10% other amazing

84
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:29,959
really interesting terpene profiles and

85
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:32,418
high numbers and you think well that's

86
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,310
like one thing I noticed like in I don't

87
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:36,439
have my farm much but I when I go to

88
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,240
different events like I don't like the

89
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:42,050
commercial events but if I do go to them

90
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,780
the products a lot more similar and what

91
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,310
I think is super cool along the the

92
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,689
wonderful things I learned and the

93
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,660
wonderful conversation I have are great

94
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:52,459
but something cool is like these like

95
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,110
you guys are saying about likely in the

96
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,728
morning than natural farming community

97
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,038
you have this like oh this is this

98
00:04:55,728 --> 00:05:01,699
random across off my Hill like my

99
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:03,050
neighbor's dad like worked at now I've

100
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:05,959
been working with it for a while and

101
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,100
like that's just really cool if somebody

102
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,469
have these really crazy different

103
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,540
experience

104
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:14,270
the I don't know that that I do that is

105
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,189
too super super cool to like and then

106
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:17,569
the stories that go with that like some

107
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:19,759
of the varieties I'm sure you see it in

108
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:22,819
your local region you know maybe some

109
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,209
older legacy farmers that are like hey

110
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:30,199
we have like that's where the best

111
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:33,919
things come from we've worked with this

112
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,829
you know stuff has been handed down it

113
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,980
takes a long time and it's been a lot of

114
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:42,949
people's hands and work it was it's not

115
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,810
like and even the people who really were

116
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:47,539
like the keepers of the Lions and the

117
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,149
breeders the elders the holders like

118
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,189
generation that brought a lot of these

119
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:54,919
seeds out to the hills and started

120
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:56,689
working with them you know they had tons

121
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,210
of people that were instrumental in

122
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:02,089
helping them acquire all these things

123
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:04,039
like none of us did it alone like the

124
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:06,949
library that we hold today that we're

125
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,920
working with is an extreme privilege an

126
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:12,829
honor to be working with but you know it

127
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:17,629
is like it took so many people's hands

128
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:20,449
along the way to to bring a catalog of

129
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:22,100
genetics together like that and to take

130
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:24,800
the time over I need it like a joint

131
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:29,360
you've got a simulated Randy yeah it's

132
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:32,030
like a scotch or yeah but it's you know

133
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,620
it's it's very special to the cultural

134
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:35,119
heritage of all of these different

135
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,269
little regions in the Triangle

136
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,470
especially is all of the stuff that

137
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:43,919
we've been

138
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,780
keeping as communities you know and then

139
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,790
circles of friends and family and

140
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:53,549
sharing it and and so now this whole you

141
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,650
know explosion of like everything that's

142
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,560
happening with genetics and with

143
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,509
technology and just in all realms even

144
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,980
aside cannabis but here we are the

145
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:06,480
keepers of all of this biodiversity you

146
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:13,830
know there's people like us all over the

147
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:17,939
world who are cannabis you know with all

148
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:19,500
seeds with all plants something that

149
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:22,589
we're gonna lose if we let another

150
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,689
generation go by where we don't try and

151
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:29,159
keep this information you know what I

152
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:32,329
mean like we did we didn't grow up no

153
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,970
work you know like doing this our

154
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:39,959
grandparents did our parents our parents

155
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:46,100
like remember their grandparents stuff

156
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:46,099
but like it's it's almost lost you know

157
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:58,569
yeah and the thing that's really

158
00:07:54,999 --> 00:08:02,889
interesting is you know with biodynamic

159
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:04,989
farming and so when Rudolf Steiner gave

160
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:09,519
his lectures they were having these

161
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:12,268
concerns in in the 20s you know that was

162
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:17,348
a hundred years ago and so it's

163
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:25,168
concerning and that was before even

164
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:27,668
synthetic fertilizers that was they were

165
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:30,068
how they were providing their fertility

166
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:32,500
they were start when they first started

167
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,418
outsourcing fertility and changing the

168
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,240
way they were raising animals and not

169
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:41,228
keeping that system integrated and mono

170
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:45,750
cropping and separating so in

171
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:48,459
traditional natural farming methods your

172
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:51,458
fertility is coming from the land it's

173
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:53,469
basically you're taking all the manures

174
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,849
and wastes and byproducts of all the

175
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,519
living things on the land and things

176
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:01,019
that fall and all that goes into the

177
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:05,470
soil as waste the soil consumes it and

178
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:07,720
makes it available as nutrition for the

179
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,750
next generation of seeds to grow and

180
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,790
it's a closed system of fertility or an

181
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:17,259
integrated cycle that all works together

182
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:22,778
so that you don't have to spend money or

183
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:26,230
go outside of your immediate locality to

184
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:29,019
source your fertility it's renewable but

185
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,329
we changed the way we farmed about a

186
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:35,470
hundred years ago and it was essentially

187
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:39,008
peasant farming and and it really wasn't

188
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,120
necessarily fair for people and so you

189
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:42,789
know we've gone through a lot of

190
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,490
different different issues with like

191
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:47,578
people's rights and stuff flora we've

192
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,740
gone away from peasant farming too but

193
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:52,870
for the health and how we need to be

194
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,180
feeding ourselves and working with the

195
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,250
land like that kind of farming is in

196
00:09:55,179 --> 00:10:00,439
tune with nature and it's connected

197
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:04,490
it's it's a part of it it's it's

198
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,040
actually how we evolved from nature you

199
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,629
know and it's our what we're supposed to

200
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:13,189
be doing with ourselves we're very

201
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:15,649
machine oriented Daniel from radical

202
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:19,670
herbs gave a really awesome biodynamic

203
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:21,559
stalk yesterday and he was talking about

204
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:23,599
some of the signer concepts about how

205
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:25,250
it's very mineral oriented and we're so

206
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,840
obsessed with machines and making

207
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,879
machines to do everything we're not

208
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:35,480
connected with the natural world anymore

209
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:38,360
and so you know when we do connect with

210
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:45,070
the natural world amazing things start

211
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:48,139
to happen that we we see them happening

212
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:50,680
without science to explain it and then

213
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:56,090
when we bring science in to explain it

214
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:58,219
it's like well it only maybe when we

215
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:05,570
maybe understand a little bit more about

216
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:10,340
what's happening but we're just reassign

217
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:12,680
is just there to explain the phenomena

218
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:17,269
the phenomena is a mystery and when we

219
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:19,729
participate with the mystery then the

220
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:22,460
magic happens and science is like oh

221
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:26,389
let's take some observations on that

222
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:30,320
magic because like we've we've been

223
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:32,659
doing this like and we've been finding

224
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,940
like what we didn't know we could grow

225
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,370
weed that tested like that you know what

226
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:41,000
I mean we weren't really thinking about

227
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:43,460
the testing but that's amazing or like

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,590
we didn't know that when we picked the

229
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:50,629
trichomes at that ripeness well when you

230
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:53,930
we had somebody out who takes very very

231
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:56,450
very macro photos and that are like

232
00:11:53,929 --> 00:12:01,199
every five microns he has a picture in

233
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:07,259
focus and a trichome is you know like 73

234
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:09,240
under 90 or so and I mean what they look

235
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:13,649
like when they're actually right and

236
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:16,320
it's just like I have no idea and then

237
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:18,620
you see indoor trichomes and they're

238
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:38,879
just these clear plain bland little

239
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:40,620
things you know I don't know we don't

240
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:47,610
really run into a lot of indoor hydro

241
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:51,149
doors here honestly but usually we just

242
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:53,129
I like to smoke like we like to show

243
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:58,039
people in each other's weed right and

244
00:12:53,129 --> 00:13:00,778
and because people love weed and you

245
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:03,750
know I don't usually talk shit to people

246
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:05,399
I'm here I try be I'm nice about it even

247
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,419
though I have my convictions and was

248
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:12,659
like you know to each their own I don't

249
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:16,909
really feel like like I'm into my thing

250
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:20,519
and you can be in your thing but

251
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:21,929
usually people are in it's I like it

252
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,110
when I talked to a hydro grower and

253
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:27,120
they're like well your weed and I'm like

254
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,550
yeah this is my full term outdoor and I

255
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,159
made everything I didn't you know like

256
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:34,469
we still buy animal feed but aside from

257
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,370
that we try to really be conscious about

258
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:41,370
like everything being crafted to go that

259
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,549
goes into it and making our own composts

260
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:48,778
all the way to all our own fertilizers

261
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:55,500
and vinegars and various so what's three

262
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:57,889
things so the compost making is we kind

263
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,409
of we do buy more by the biodynamic

264
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:03,419
guidelines with the preps and and so

265
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:06,240
we've been practicing that and so it's

266
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:11,629
just refining and getting better at that

267
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:14,549
than building piles of layers and but

268
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:18,838
what I've been experimenting with more

269
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:23,838
lately is our rainwater pond which is

270
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:28,320
that I can open reservoir and so we had

271
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,740
we did some like water testing and we

272
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,740
found

273
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:36,919
it has above adequate phosphorus we have

274
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:38,838
like a high bat population that comes

275
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:41,539
every night meets the mosquitoes that

276
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:45,310
that growth you know so we're trying to

277
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:48,199
create it like an ecosystem with that

278
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:50,659
they fly over the over the pond and so

279
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:55,399
we're trying to use we're trying to use

280
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:57,860
the pond yeah we're like realizing we

281
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:01,028
can use this it's not necessarily an

282
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:05,120
aquaponics system but it's kind of like

283
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:06,708
it's a it's it's like a it's kind of

284
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,659
like aquaponics cuz we have a lot of

285
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:14,989
frogs we have a lot of you know we're

286
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:17,208
encouraging it to be habitat although

287
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,370
we're not necessarily supposed to like I

288
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,719
feel like you know the regs according to

289
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,269
the regulations but you know like I

290
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,110
don't care we're doing something good

291
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:29,209
with it that's well that's a Bobo node

292
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:34,550
that's me that's a bullfrog management

293
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:36,619
plan a little bit different but just in

294
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:38,629
general is that you can make habitats

295
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,789
you can't take it away and that's where

296
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:42,769
it gets very difficult in terms of using

297
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:44,480
our water source I assume that this is

298
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:48,320
like not in any way shape and in stream

299
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,139
ponds that you guys know it's solely so

300
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,910
origin is like the catchment surfaces of

301
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:59,509
our buildings so but that being said

302
00:15:55,909 --> 00:16:01,429
we're we're trying to create this we're

303
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:03,198
trying to use this stored water to

304
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:05,689
create benefits to the whole landscape

305
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,578
right and so we're bringing in bats

306
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:10,579
we're bringing in yellow-legged frogs

307
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:12,559
which are to threaten new species and

308
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:15,439
they might be interested as endangered

309
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,750
soon but there's everywhere all over our

310
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,060
place and that that's beautiful you know

311
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,690
and then we bring in the green hair and

312
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:23,859
then the

313
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:26,690
here and he comes sometimes and and so

314
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,480
this year what we want to do is when we

315
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:32,300
go do willow get our willow for basket

316
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,129
making and we're gonna keep them supple

317
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:36,469
in the pond and we're basically using

318
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:38,570
that to make a big willow tea that we're

319
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,300
watering over the whole garden and and

320
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,910
we're using these combining all of these

321
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:46,549
different things to like make more

322
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:50,600
fertility and make more abundance not

323
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:56,449
just for us but for for everybody you

324
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:58,759
know not so you know other farmers but

325
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,460
also like the plants and animals that

326
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:04,900
we've live around this home it's been
