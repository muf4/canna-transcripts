[Music]

2
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,399
what I wanted to start with before I

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,039
talk about myself and about my

4
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:24,679
organization I want to talk about the

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,279
drug war and what brought me here which

6
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:30,278
is social justice and I think we need to

7
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:33,238
understand and and go back not just to

8
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:36,320
1914 but to the modern-day drug war and

9
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:39,320
understand that our drug laws have never

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,520
been about the harms of the drug but

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:47,480
about who has been using the drug and so

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,079
let me read you a a quote that Dan bomb

13
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:51,038
uh wrote an article and if you haven't

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,878
read his book smoke and mirrors I'd

15
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,679
highly recommend it but this last year

16
00:00:53,878 --> 00:01:00,119
he wrote an article called Legalize It

17
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:06,118
All Because from my perspective Mar

18
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:09,319
marijuana is the Tipping Point to get us

19
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:13,280
to blow up the drug war completely which

20
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:17,239
has been the largest AB failure of

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:21,319
policy in the United States since

22
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:23,239
slavery so Dan bomb stated in an article

23
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,599
the Nixon campaign in

24
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:29,719
1968 and the Nixon White House had two

25
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:32,640
enemies the anti-war left and black

26
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:36,118
people people we know we couldn't make

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,079
it illegal to be either against the war

28
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:42,078
or black but by getting the public to

29
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:44,438
associate the hippies with marijuana and

30
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,399
blacks with heroin and then

31
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:49,919
criminalizing both heavily we could

32
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,159
disrupt those communities we could

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,640
arrest their leaders raid their homes

34
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,640
break up their meetings and vilify them

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,599
night after night on the evening news

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,759
did we know we were l about drugs of

37
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:09,079
course we

38
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:13,318
did and so that is the single best

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,719
reason for us to clearly not just blow

40
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:19,199
up the drug war but to look at

41
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:23,159
proposition 64 that I will tell you is

42
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:28,238
not perfect but it provides a social

43
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:30,359
justice component that no other adult

44
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,560
consumption initiative or medical

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:38,239
marijuana initiative has done in our

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:42,280
nation so today in the United States we

47
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:45,000
make a cannabis arrest every 49 seconds

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,959
so whoever the mathematician is here

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,680
starting when this started at 6:30 till

50
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,519
when we in

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,680
tonight one person is going to jail

52
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,840
every 49 seconds almost every

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,640
minute nine states are voting uh for

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,120
adult consumption or or medical this

55
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,039
year it isn't just the five states that

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,680
are voting for adult consumption we have

57
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,318
Florida and we have other medical

58
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,959
marijuana states as well so this last

59
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,919
year in 2015 I think it's critically

60
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,239
important to understand that in the

61
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:24,759
United States we arrested

62
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:29,799
1,488 77 million people for all drug

63
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:32,840
offenses out of those it was over 64

64
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,519
4,000 that were for marijuana alone and

65
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,438
when we start

66
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:42,080
looking at the issues of the arrest is

67
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:44,318
one of the things from my perspective as

68
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,640
a career law enforcement professional

69
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:51,560
what I saw occur is that our drug war

70
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:54,958
policies has driven

71
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,598
a excuse me sorry our drug war policies

72
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,120
has driven a wedge between police

73
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:03,199
professionals who who used to be peace

74
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,680
officers and would work in collaboration

75
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,399
with our communities to mindlessly

76
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,959
policing people and causing the issues

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,799
that we see today so let me tell you a

78
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,438
little bit about who I represent law

79
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,639
enforcement against prohibition was

80
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:23,040
founded in 2002 by five police officers

81
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,439
four American one Canadian who all had

82
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,759
worked in law enforcement and again

83
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,879
recognize the largest object failure of

84
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:35,319
policy wasn't in fact our our drug war

85
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:38,918
since 2002 we have grown from five

86
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:42,000
police officers to over 5,000 current

87
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:45,159
former and retired we're not just all

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,279
retired criminal justice professionals

89
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,360
representing the spectrum of anybody

90
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,038
who's ever

91
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,520
touched somebody potentially going to

92
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:58,038
jail or being arrested for the drug for

93
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,560
for drugs our chairman right now is

94
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,800
actually in active duty Gardon in New

95
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,759
Hampshire who has one of the most

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,759
Progressive jail

97
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:11,479
systems that you will ever see we have

98
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,199
police Chiefs in the United States that

99
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:17,439
belong to our organizations as well as

100
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:20,960
tons of retired Das retired police

101
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,759
officers retired DEA agents not just in

102
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,359
the United States but across the world I

103
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,800
had the pleasure this year to go speak

104
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,919
in uh the United Kingdom when we opened

105
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,240
up our leap United Kingdom branch in the

106
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:39,599
House of Commons and so when we look at

107
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,079
what the drug war has done and why

108
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,319
marijuana or cannabis because I hate to

109
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,680
use the term marijuana is so important

110
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,479
for legalization I'd like for you guys

111
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,478
not just to look at California because

112
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,359
yes we've been very Progressive in

113
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,800
California and we've

114
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,879
decriminalized you know if you possess

115
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,240
less than and less than an ANC of

116
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,399
marijuana you get a traffic ticket but

117
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,280
one of the things that that recently

118
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,679
came to light is the drug policy

119
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:12,119
Alliance who is one of the proponents of

120
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:15,759
proposition 64 did a report and in the

121
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,840
last 10 years we have arrested almost a

122
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,680
half million people outside of those

123
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:26,839
infractions for not just misdemeanor and

124
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:30,840
felonies so there are still people today

125
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:33,560
going to jail for cannabis and so one of

126
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:37,000
the things that proposition 64 does if

127
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:40,360
it passes and I believe that it will is

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,839
at 121 midnight is anyone who's

129
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,560
currently in jail for a felony that is

130
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:49,000
now a misdemeanor what will occur they

131
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,598
can immediately ask to be resentenced to

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,598
that lower

133
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,159
misdemeanor for

134
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,120
people that have been previously

135
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,120
convicted and maybe have already serve

136
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,840
their sentences will immediately be able

137
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,038
to ask for their sentences to be reduced

138
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,318
or

139
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:13,598
expunged because we

140
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:15,720
know that a drug conviction is unlike

141
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,959
any other conviction there are

142
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,759
collateral consequences to it there's

143
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:23,638
Professional Licensing there's loss of

144
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,680
of driver's licenses if you're a kid

145
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,680
there's loss of Federal Aid to student

146
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,240
loans there's a loss of housing you you

147
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,038
may not be able to adopt a kid or get

148
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,439
welfare benefits or get food benefits

149
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:41,598
there is no other

150
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:45,279
crime other than the drug war that

151
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,279
causes these types of collateral

152
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,000
consequences so what I want to do

153
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,639
because I spent a career in law

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,879
enforcement there's Redondo Beach people

155
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:59,120
here there's Joan there's Beth there's

156
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,599
all sorts of people I I grew up in the

157
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,000
south Bay I grew up in South Torrance

158
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,878
graduated from South High and I think

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,240
for me is I always jokingly because I I

160
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,800
blog prolifically and I i' in I started

161
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,240
in this space in 2010 during the

162
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,800
proposition 19 campaign and so I've I've

163
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:24,519
seen the full circle that comes and I'm

164
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,520
encouraged for the future of where I see

165
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,120
not the social just not just the social

166
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:32,000
justice issues but where the industry is

167
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,799
is going because I don't see what people

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,918
are afraid of which is the alleged big

169
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,079
marijuana what I see is the validation

170
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,759
and the support of the mom and the pop

171
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,879
businesses the spa owners that want to

172
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:48,838
develop Spa products the cultivators

173
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:51,559
that are doing CBD water you know the

174
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,720
Edibles the the market is going to

175
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:56,919
expand and I know that there's this fear

176
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,120
that that adult consumption in

177
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:02,559
proposition 64 is going to impact

178
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,440
patients rights but what I would like to

179
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:08,078
say is that one of the leading attorneys

180
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,200
Bill Panzer does everybody know or does

181
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:11,559
anybody know who Bill Panzer is there

182
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,720
should be a lot of people he's from

183
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,838
Northern California helped start normal

184
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,959
in California one of the leading

185
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,279
marijuana attorneys has written an

186
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:25,559
article and he breaks down every section

187
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:28,360
of propos proposition 64 with regard to

188
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:30,479
patients rights and what he says is

189
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,959
there is no

190
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,360
effect if if the proposition

191
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:40,479
64 uh comes to fruition on patients

192
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,800
right and in fact it validates them and

193
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,039
in fact because I unfortunately have had

194
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,958
to take kids away from their parents is

195
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:51,480
it will

196
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:53,559
support a parent's right to not have

197
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,839
their children taken away from them

198
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,319
simply for being a qualified medical

199
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,079
marijuana patient no different than if I

200
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,760
had to take Viking

201
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:04,919
so I know that there's hope I'm hoping

202
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,600
lots of questions and and Jackie and I

203
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,559
talked is I don't want to just sit here

204
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,200
and talk I'd like to actually answer any

205
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,078
questions that you might you guys may

206
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,879
have from a law enforcement perspective

207
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:20,199
so for example if proposition 64 passes

208
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:22,078
is that law enforcement won't be able to

209
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,160
use the smell of marijuana to search

210
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,479
your car search your

211
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,838
house you know so so I'd like to just

212
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,159
kind of open up the floor to questions

213
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,480
and answers or questions and I'll answer

214
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:38,719
Peter

215
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,759
S so tell me something you don't like

216
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,320
about the way something within prop 64

217
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,439
that you don't like you've talked about

218
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,480
things you do

219
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,480
like you know I think that the concern

220
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,278
is over prop 64 that there's this

221
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,159
overregulation

222
00:10:54,278 --> 00:11:01,159
and I think that there's this

223
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:04,000
fear that it's so so from my perspective

224
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:08,078
is I don't necessarily think that it's

225
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,919
over regulated but but H sitting down

226
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,679
with the people who authored it because

227
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,719
I've been to editorial boards with them

228
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,439
and I'm very involved in the campaign so

229
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,000
I want you to know when I came into the

230
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,200
campaign leap as an an organization

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,240
endorse it because it met our social

232
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,320
justice issues I wasn't necessarily 100%

233
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,278
on board and it wasn't until really

234
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:34,200
sitting down and and talking to the

235
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:37,399
authors where I've really come fully to

236
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,519
grasp it so I think that the worst thing

237
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,240
about is that people are afraid because

238
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,120
it's 62

239
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,320
pages and yet I would tell you having

240
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,679
worked in the space of law enforcement

241
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:54,480
and seeing how laws get made is that

242
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:56,359
this is not necessarily any different

243
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,680
except for one of the things that

244
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,959
happened is they had to address so many

245
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,359
issues of about around regulation so you

246
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:06,638
know with a tomato you have agricultural

247
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,360
components but the you know the

248
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,240
initiative also had to cover business

249
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,360
and professions and they had to cover

250
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,440
taxing and they had to cover where the

251
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,759
allocations of money went so that's what

252
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,760
made it long but one of the things that

253
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:24,240
I like about it is that there is in fact

254
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:27,399
flexibility so from a taxing perspective

255
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,799
it's at a 15% excise tax which is the

256
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:34,519
lowest tax rate than any other adult

257
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:37,319
consumption initiative ever so it's so

258
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,000
it so they took a look at you know from

259
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,720
a public safety p uh standpoint is we're

260
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,399
never going to eliminate the illicit

261
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,440
Market you know and nobody has ever said

262
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,600
um in in any of the ballot initiatives

263
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,480
that we were going to so I worked in

264
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Colorado I spent a week in Colorado

265
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
during the Colorado campaign doing

266
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,360
presentations to Republican women's

267
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,199
groups about why they should support it

268
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,519
you know so stefon's right this is

269
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:06,240
really kind of a very interesting

270
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,078
bipartisan uh support it's not just

271
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,680
Democrats that support ending the drug

272
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,958
war there there is actually kind of some

273
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:17,159
liberty-minded Republicans that do as

274
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:19,799
well a and you know so I it's there's

275
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:23,958
those issues there's enough

276
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:26,159
flexibility that down the road that for

277
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:29,759
example is people are unhappy that it

278
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:32,799
doesn't repeal all cannabis laws but the

279
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:35,278
polling behind that is is that if if we

280
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,198
basically repealed every cannabis law

281
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,759
right now it would never pass and we'd

282
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:43,399
still be going out arresting people in a

283
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,319
very desperate fashion like we do at

284
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,399
this point because all of us need to

285
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:52,959
recognize that we enforce our drug laws

286
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:55,000
differently in weho in Redondo Beach and

287
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:59,239
comparison to South Central Los Angeles

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,559
or in East LA or in Santa Ana and and so

289
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,680
it's you know it it we have to get

290
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:08,518
people that don't necessarily believe in

291
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,958
cannabis it's not just about the the

292
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,320
people who are in the industry or the

293
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:16,239
Cannabis consumer or the patient we have

294
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,600
to sell this to all the other soccer

295
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,120
moms that I speak to all the time and

296
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,879
are absolutely petrified about this

297
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,839
issue so that's a long way of answering

298
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:29,799
your question I think that people don't

299
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,320
like its length

300
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,319
but there's not an understanding of why

301
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,680
it became that

302
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,160
lengthy well if I could just add to that

303
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:39,519
and we were at the state of marijuana

304
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,958
the other day and Betty ye from the

305
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,839
state controller was speaking and she

306
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,758
made a really important comment which

307
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,279
was that the Cannabis industry is really

308
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,720
the first industry to raise their hands

309
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,519
and say regulate us we want to be

310
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,800
regulated because we want safe we want

311
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,320
safety no number one we want safety and

312
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,240
we want to pay taxes it's not like we

313
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,720
don't want to we don't want to stay

314
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,919
underground anymore more so if we want

315
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,639
to be a real business and really exist

316
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,278
in the rest of the world then we do need

317
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,879
to be regulated I think no we don't need

318
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,519
to be over regulated but we certainly

319
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,720
need to be regulated and I think that

320
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,320
that was a consensus among the industry

321
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,720
yeah and and I think the interesting

322
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,959
part is one of the things that people

323
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:20,800
don't understand is that the fixes in

324
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:23,239
the future can't increase so for example

325
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,758
you have all the penalties you you know

326
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,720
yes there's still certain wobblers and

327
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,959
other stuff but but as we go down the

328
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,759
road

329
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:35,559
we can lessen the penalties if the sky

330
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,440
doesn't fall if everything works out you

331
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,278
know the money allocation for this is

332
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,519
very interesting one of the things that

333
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:46,639
happens is that for the first time is

334
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:50,278
money from um the the excise taxes are

335
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,639
going to go to communities of color you

336
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:56,159
know is it's going to start out at 10

337
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,198
million $10 million a year and at year

338
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,519
five it's going to increase to 50

339
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:02,399
million a year

340
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,399
for people to be able to it's going to

341
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,159
go to like the business Economic

342
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,958
Development people are going to be able

343
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:12,360
to do grants to start businesses or to

344
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:14,318
do education or jobs or other type of

345
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,199
infrastructure that's something that's

346
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:19,519
never happened in any other initiative

347
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,439
there's money that we're basically

348
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,440
telling the federal

349
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:29,879
government we're going to do research on

350
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,720
the efficacy in medical marijuana

351
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:38,078
because we're going to give money to the

352
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:40,079
UC system to basically I is research the

353
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,120
efficacy of marijuana see what people

354
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,439
don't understand and this is I spent a

355
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,480
lot of time in this kind of weird space

356
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,639
crossing a lot of boundaries is today I

357
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,360
read an article as belli the drugs Zar

358
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,680
admitted that our United State's

359
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,000
government has finally you know said

360
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:01,799
yeah we've limited the amount of resour

361
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,679
Arch on the efficacy only 6% of the

362
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,599
research by the national institutions

363
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:10,798
for drug abuse has gone to show the

364
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:13,318
efficacy of marijuana 94% has gone to

365
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:17,558
show its harms and what people don't

366
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:21,159
understand even in the industry is naida

367
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:23,359
funds 80 to 90% of the research not just

368
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,279
in the United States but across the

369
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:29,879
world and so you know is the the United

370
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,558
States on a global level has pushed out

371
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,520
this drug prohibition policy and it's

372
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:38,240
impact I I was born in Mexico City I'm

373
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,759
dual citizen I have I have a cousin

374
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,720
who's a a Mexican federali down there

375
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,558
and we talk all the time and we talk

376
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,759
about the issues that are going down in

377
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:53,440
Mexico president piano nto two weeks ago

378
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:57,319
basically stated if California legalizes

379
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,960
he's going to change the Mexican law in

380
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:03,960
in Mexico and asked for marijuana to be

381
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:07,480
legalized in Mexico that will reduce

382
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,360
death in the country that I love and

383
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,519
that's the thing about drug prohibition

384
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,279
that what people don't understand is the

385
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:18,079
only thing that prohibiting a substance

386
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:20,519
has done is empowered cartels and the

387
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,678
cops and I'm going to be very honest

388
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,480
about that it has completely empowered

389
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,919
us and it's contributed to death disease

390
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,880
and addiction in our communities and

391
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:35,919
leap exists to change that Paradigm and

392
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,559
and so but we need all your help and so

393
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,720
you know it's one of those very

394
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:45,038
interesting things I'm I'm kind of I'm

395
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,440
not a patient I don't smoke cannabis but

396
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:51,079
I'm here supporting people's right to do

397
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,360
so because I think it's a objectively

398
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:56,918
safer than alcohol because in my 22

399
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:59,839
years I never once went to a house where

400
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,080
someone who who was high beat the heck

401
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,959
out of their wife their kids or molested

402
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,879
them or raped and pillaged the

403
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:11,919
neighborhood alcohol all the time and so

404
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,960
I believe that the only harms and what

405
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,159
causes violence is prohibition and if we

406
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,798
ended the drug war completely we would

407
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:23,919
reduce crime in impoverished

408
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:26,400
neighborhoods because we would take the

409
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,559
market share from people that are trying

410
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,919
to survive by selling drugs and instead

411
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:34,720
we can put money back in there for jobs

412
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,840
education infrastructure Public Health

413
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,360
mental health programs all right who

414
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,359
else has a

415
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:48,839
question I I'm curious um what it oh

416
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:51,480
it's on yeah uh what is leap's position

417
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:56,119
on legalizing uh the rest of the drugs

418
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:59,279
heroin cocaine all that sure so um leap

419
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:03,399
believes that the regulation of drugs

420
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:06,639
should be a state byst state decision

421
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,720
because substance use or abuse or you

422
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,759
know regulating the Cannabis industry is

423
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,400
different in California than it is let's

424
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,679
say in New York but around the issues of

425
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,320
things like heroin and cocaine

426
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,600
methamphetamine or other opioids is that

427
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:24,960
we believe that nobody should go to

428
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,439
prison for

429
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,400
drugs if you commit a murder because

430
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,080
you're high or you get a car and you

431
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,480
drive under the influence or you break

432
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:35,240
into people's

433
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,798
houses right go right ahead but that we

434
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,400
should Implement public health

435
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:42,319
strategies so for example in Switzerland

436
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,440
they have what's called heroin assisted

437
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,759
treatment

438
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,519
programs long a and so if you're a

439
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:53,480
chronic heroin addict you don't go to

440
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:56,679
jail you get referred to a doctor who

441
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,960
prescribes you heroin you go to a safe

442
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,679
injection facility

443
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,558
and what Switzerland has seen and what

444
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,919
other countries have seen including you

445
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:08,879
know is uh Portugal it it was

446
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:12,038
implemented previously in Germany and

447
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,159
the United Kingdom Canada is now uh

448
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:16,278
nationally going to be be using heroin

449
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,679
assisted treatment program is that it

450
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:22,000
reduced

451
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,919
overdoses it reduced addiction because

452
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,720
by making it a public health strategy

453
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,278
encourage people to get into treatment

454
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,720
and from the public safety standpoint

455
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:33,960
the most fascinating thing in

456
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,038
Switzerland it reduced property crime 60

457
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,679
to 80% because you know why people

458
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,599
weren't breaking into our houses or in

459
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,360
our cars or stealing in order to get

460
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:49,079
money to support their hair their public

461
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:52,038
health problem so yes we are we want to

462
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:55,879
see com the complete elimination of

463
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:58,038
drugs going to prison and you know in

464
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,559
the United States that may be a very

465
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:02,400
difficult thing but I think what we can

466
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:04,918
at least do is decriminalize like

467
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,159
Portugal did who has seen some

468
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:10,278
tremendous results in their country

469
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:13,000
where you know is you can possess up to

470
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:15,000
10 days of any drug and you're not going

471
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,720
to go to jail for it unless you commit a

472
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,240
crime outside of it okay thank you we

473
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,000
got one here um as I as I referenced I

474
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,960
did online child protection funded by

475
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,880
the adult entertainment industry and you

476
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:32,200
mentioned one of the things they're

477
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:35,559
going to try to do is use you know the

478
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,278
fact that people are involved and about

479
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:39,440
child protection and I think it's going

480
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:41,798
to be one of the things that's really

481
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,919
very important in the industry for you

482
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:47,839
to address and come up with regulations

483
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:51,559
on because they will use when once you

484
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:53,839
say kids well so so so here's the

485
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:56,079
misnomer and and Stefan and we got a

486
00:22:53,839 --> 00:23:00,199
couple attorneys in here that understand

487
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:02,278
it today in the United or in California

488
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,840
because I've I've had to deal with this

489
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:09,919
situation you can be an alcoholic you

490
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:12,599
can abuse prescription drugs and as long

491
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,799
as you don't endanger your child through

492
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:17,359
some type of physical endangerment you

493
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,839
have to be able to justify it you know

494
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,359
is is you got a mom that's passed out

495
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,158
because she's addicted to prescription

496
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,759
drugs and the three-year-old runs into

497
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:28,760
the street that's a reason to get child

498
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,960
service involved the problem today is

499
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:33,440
what you have is drug end danger

500
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,240
children laws that have been

501
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,038
incentivized by the federal government

502
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,240
and um what happens is the California

503
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:44,240
narcotics officers Association trains

504
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,480
the social workers under the drug

505
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,798
endangered children laws that were

506
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,558
actually started because of the

507
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,839
methamphetamine labs and they're now

508
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:56,678
using it to take qualified medical

509
00:23:52,839 --> 00:24:00,038
marijuana patients kids away and so that

510
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:03,038
so they're using the law wrong you know

511
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:05,839
it's it's you've you've never been able

512
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,558
to just take people's kids away because

513
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,038
they're growing marijuana or their

514
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:12,000
patients the problem is is that people

515
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:15,278
don't have the economic resources to

516
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,798
hire attorneys in order to fight it one

517
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,359
of the things that's very clear that has

518
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:24,400
actually been written into proposition

519
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:27,038
64 is added protection for medical

520
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,880
marijuana patients so people will say

521
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,679
well why didn't you do it for the adult

522
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,760
consumption market and I say because

523
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,038
it's different in that that it's going

524
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:39,558
to be like alcohol in the sense of if

525
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:40,839
you're in your home and you smoke a

526
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:42,879
joint no one's going to be able to come

527
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,519
in and take your kid because you smoke a

528
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,240
joint if you smoke a joint and you pass

529
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,359
out and your kid gets hit by a car your

530
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,120
kid's going to get taken away so it's

531
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:54,398
all about responsible parenting and

532
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:57,479
public service announcements but I think

533
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:59,319
we do owe medical marijuana patients

534
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,038
that added prote protetion because we

535
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:04,439
have devastated

536
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:07,519
families thank you do we have time for

537
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,960
another one

538
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:13,440
yeah hi I hate these things um you

539
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,759
talked about or it was it was it was

540
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,200
talked about the fact that you could

541
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:20,038
have 08 or eight grams on each person if

542
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,919
they were pulled over by a

543
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:26,960
car so that's eight grams of concentrate

544
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,159
and you can have 28.5 gram of butter

545
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,840
Leaf okay is there is there anything in

546
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:35,600
prop 64 that says that a law enforcement

547
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:37,639
officer can't say that one person had

548
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,278
all this on them so that they can use it

549
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,880
against people who are being pulled over

550
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:44,119
so so so are so what you that's my first

551
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,039
question can ask the same second

552
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:46,038
question at the same time because I know

553
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,000
you'll probably talk about the same

554
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:53,440
thing and also is there anything in prop

555
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,519
64 that has uh that establishes a task

556
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,240
force or anything like that that begins

557
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:02,839
to see how law enforce

558
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,798
units in um neighborhoods of color or

559
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:06,278
places like that are using them are we

560
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,798
going to still up end up in the same

561
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,038
place where we have you know black kids

562
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,000
get pulled over for for grams and white

563
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,640
kids just go off to their party well so

564
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,079
so here's very interesting so let let me

565
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,799
say this about the kid issue one of the

566
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:24,798
protections that has been put into prop

567
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:28,519
64 is right now it's a misdemeanor if

568
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:31,038
you're under the age of 18 to possess

569
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:33,119
any marijuana it you know you don't get

570
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,000
an infraction like you do if you're 18

571
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,798
and

572
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,880
above so under prop 64 it reduces that

573
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:44,759
for our children so it's only an

574
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:49,320
infraction so you can't so our kids

575
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:51,798
can't go to jail for having 28.5 grams

576
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:55,558
or eight grams of concentrate or less

577
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:57,440
not only that but they can't get a fine

578
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:58,720
because if they can't afford it and the

579
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,080
worst thing that's going to happen to

580
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,640
them is they go to community

581
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:08,759
service on top of that for our children

582
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,880
is that when they turn 18 today your

583
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:13,960
records your kids records don't get

584
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,120
automatically expunged is when a kid

585
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,600
turns 18 if they have any marijuana

586
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:20,678
related arrest it automatically gets

587
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:22,240
expensed off their record and the kids

588
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:26,399
don't even have to

589
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,679
apply now that people are are are saying

590
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,879
oh my God the 18 to 21 year olds are

591
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,120
going to get arrested well I will tell

592
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,399
you that I think those 18 20 to 20 year

593
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,359
olds right now are incredibly smart and

594
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:39,639
they're going to do the exact same thing

595
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:42,398
that they've been doing since

596
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,360
Proposition 215 they're going to Coop

597
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,839
the medical system and get a

598
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:49,119
recommendation because we don't change

599
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:52,158
the recommendation language in any way

600
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:55,719
shape or form it's the same as Mera the

601
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,799
same as the language was in S420 and if

602
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,600
I had an 18 to a 20 year-old who

603
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,480
wanted to embibe in marijuana I would

604
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,398
tell them to go get a recommendation to

605
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,880
protect themselves from Criminal

606
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:10,119
statutes so that doesn't understand the

607
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,559
disparities in enforcement practices and

608
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:14,518
I think that's something that we need to

609
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:17,359
all be incredibly concerned about one of

610
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:20,319
the things that happened in Colorado is

611
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:24,879
from a percentage standpoint what you

612
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:26,240
saw is that the raw numbers of arrests

613
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,039
dropped

614
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,038
significantly across

615
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:37,000
Latino um African-American whites but

616
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:40,038
the problem was is law enforcement was

617
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
still enforcing the laws in a desparate

618
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:46,240
fashion what I'm going to tell you is

619
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,119
that um every organization that was

620
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,839
working in this space said it's not

621
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:55,639
acceptable but what this is going to do

622
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:58,319
is going to continue to shine a light on

623
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,480
the law enforcement practices that we we

624
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:04,398
need to demand change it's not going to

625
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,519
be perfect but I think it's we're going

626
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:09,719
to be able to get data because I'm a

627
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:12,200
data driven person and and continue to

628
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,600
hammer away on why we need to continue

629
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:19,519
to change law enforcement so I I believe

630
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:21,918
that there's systemic structural racism

631
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,558
in the criminal justice system I don't

632
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,120
believe that all law enforcement

633
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:29,759
officers are racist but I also don't

634
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:31,879
believe that you you have to

635
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,960
intentionally be racist to participate

636
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,600
in a system that has a disparity in

637
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,720
enforcement practices so that's what we

638
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:42,359
need to continue to move towards

639
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:45,200
changing it's complicated this isn't

640
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:48,359
going to fix that but it's going to go a

641
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,059
long way to addressing those

642
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:53,269
issues thank

643
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:53,269
[Applause]

644
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,360
you say your name uh my name is to

645
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,000
graani my question is regarding the

646
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,240
misdemeanor or the felony going to a

647
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,880
misdemeanor you said that people that

648
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,798
are in jail the next day September or

649
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,799
November 9th will be able to apply um

650
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:14,278
what can you explain what that process

651
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:15,398
would take do they need to get a lawyer

652
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:17,558
in order to do it would they have to

653
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:19,398
spend money and what happens if everyone

654
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:20,879
tries to do it at once how long it would

655
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:23,239
take them to actually be released you

656
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,960
know that we don't know that so so let's

657
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,480
say this on November 8th the drug policy

658
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,880
Alliance is in fact going to be hosting

659
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,759
a party and if it passes at

660
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,880
12:01 a.m. that morning they're going to

661
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,640
be holding an expungement Clinic that

662
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,480
they're going to have attorneys sitting

663
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,159
there and people are going to be able to

664
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:50,000
come in that night to start the

665
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,440
process so what's going to happen is

666
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,278
it's going to be a combination of things

667
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,159
I think that like if you look at what

668
00:30:54,278 --> 00:31:00,798
we've done pro uh Prop 47 relative to

669
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,519
the expungement the resentencing issues

670
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:07,440
what you have is you have a ton of um

671
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,558
attorney firms that are working pro bono

672
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,399
with people like the LA Baker

673
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:13,480
institution with the drug policy

674
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:15,959
Alliance and other organizations that

675
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,200
are doing clinics across Los Angeles

676
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,038
County and relative to Prop 47 there was

677
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,000
a 2-year um window that you were going

678
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,038
to be able to do it Jerry Brown just

679
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,440
signed a bill that extended that for

680
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:30,480
another five years so what we need is we

681
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,159
need

682
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,480
attorneys who can help in the pro bono

683
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,360
fashion and then other people if they

684
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,919
have the economic resources to pay for

685
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:41,879
attorneys they may have to pay for their

686
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:47,000
own

687
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:49,200
attorneys all right well thank you Diane

688
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,880
