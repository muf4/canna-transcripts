1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
I want to thank everyone for being here

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:08,369
and I'm just wondering how many out

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,910
there are at home growers how many of

4
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:13,859
you are planting seeds oh right great

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,219
well thank you for coming really excited

6
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:19,410
she could be here today

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:22,288
well we're being joined by Nick from

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,140
green source Gardens welcome and we have

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:29,310
Daniel here from heart Rock Mountain and

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:35,820
forest is joining us from Koval Oh Sun

11
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:40,140
roots farm in color below blue in in

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,899
Koval oh nice so I'd like to just know a

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,570
little bit about your from each one of

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,270
you just a brief introduction about your

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,659
farm about the size of your farm a

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:58,309
little bit about what you have growing

17
00:00:51,659 --> 00:01:02,358
there and a little bit also with your

18
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:02,358
your genetics program

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:10,739
okay well I'm Nick from green source

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:15,270
Gardens we are up in just outside of

21
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:20,009
Wolf Creek Oregon Southern Oregon we're

22
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:24,269
in the like foothills that begin the

23
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:27,629
makings of the Cascades so the south

24
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:29,009
west beginning foothills of the Cascades

25
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:33,179
I guess they're mountains but they're

26
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:36,590
definitely smaller we live on a mountain

27
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:41,790
that is called post mountain we're at

28
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:46,950
22,000 feet and 42 degrees latitude and

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,360
the mountain that I live on is really

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,250
close to a really big mountain in the

31
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,500
area that affects the climate in a

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,590
wetter way we're on the west side of

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,549
that mountain

34
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:02,430
full Sun southern slope on this mountain

35
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,890
called post Mountain hidden from the

36
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:09,810
agricultural lands which is nice for

37
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,098
breeding purposes and and we grow all

38
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,990
kinds of stuff

39
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:15,750
we are really interested in natural

40
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,659
realized perennials things that don't

41
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,270
take a whole lot of effort and

42
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:25,109
integrating those kinds of plant

43
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,600
cultures into production Gardens is the

44
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,940
way I believe we increase the water

45
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,419
infiltration and so that's a big thing

46
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:36,810
that we're doing there is is working on

47
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:40,949
the increased water infiltration of the

48
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,860
upper watershed and then from a genetic

49
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:45,329
standpoint cannabis wise i've been

50
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,580
collecting a lot of genetics over the

51
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,570
years and every year I make a lot of

52
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:54,330
seeds and so you know over the and I

53
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:58,139
grow all from seed so even for the

54
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:02,730
production commercial Oregon market we I

55
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:05,069
grow everything from seed and and so

56
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,929
I've had to really dive deep into that

57
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,849
process and how to make that available

58
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,310
to the market in a way that the market

59
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,960
would receive it well and so that's just

60
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,719
taken me on a journey of kind of

61
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,200
specializing seeds and directions of all

62
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,580
different types but really looking at

63
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,879
acclimating seeds through that process

64
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,580
as well as finding the dank that is easy

65
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,530
to move on the market and has to be that

66
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,330
way at this point because it's super

67
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,629
squeezed up there in Oregon there's a

68
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:36,900
lot of producers and a lot of retailers

69
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:38,609
and not that many people so that's kind

70
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,650
of the gist in terms of projects I mean

71
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,710
we maybe we get into that later I have

72
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,780
so many different directions and in in

73
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,599
ways that I'm going that I'll just leave

74
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,360
it at that

75
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,009
thanks Nick I'm Daniel and I'm in heart

76
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,320
heart rock mountain farm and we're in

77
00:03:53,009 --> 00:04:02,819
Potter Valley I was born on that farm my

78
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:06,439
dad started growing there in 77 he did a

79
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:10,500
crop before that in Santa Cruz in 76 in

80
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:12,000
ten years before that in 1966 he kept

81
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,770
his first seeds that he found in the

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,358
bottom of a bag you know now we have a

83
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,100
10,000 square foot cultivation license

84
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,259
we have a nursery license that we've

85
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,080
been doing

86
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:26,420
for two years we'd use it just for seed

87
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:30,229
production it's fun

88
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,819
I grew over 600 photoperiod plants that

89
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,950
were three foot to six foot tall for

90
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:37,459
seed production this year in the year

91
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:42,129
before you know we have over 350 seed

92
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:46,759
Lots and you know five oto flowers and

93
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:48,409
it's you know I'm a bit of a crazy

94
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,959
person because I just keep making more

95
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:57,290
you know and just heritage strains that

96
00:04:53,959 --> 00:05:00,289
you know we and then we endure freedom

97
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:09,860
with designer genetics and just keep

98
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:12,080
playing around hi my name is Forrest I'm

99
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,199
born and raised in Cavallo California in

100
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:20,419
the mountains and now I have a 10 acre

101
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:22,939
farm in the valley we have animals and

102
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:29,150
fruit trees and all sorts of other

103
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:31,790
things growing on the farm we the

104
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:34,009
varieties that we grow are passed down

105
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,140
from our my family for a while and

106
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:40,159
they've been climatized to the region

107
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:43,310
and we grow really big plants that in

108
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,320
full Sun that you know just showing

109
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,530
their full expression each year

110
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:52,159
throughout the season so those are some

111
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:52,519
big plants you grow what what were you

112
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,200
saying

113
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:59,539
twenty pound plant really big plants and

114
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:05,300
covilhÃ£ not just my farm but like a lot

115
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:07,460
of farms around me yeah can you just I

116
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,620
wouldn't mind growing one of these big

117
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:11,389
plants can you just give me for these

118
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,970
home growers out there I mean come on

119
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:17,180
six twenty pound plants okay let's hear

120
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:20,570
a little some tips on how to grow some

121
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:24,560
big plants it's all about timing having

122
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:26,149
really good seed it's all really like

123
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,370
the first thing that you have to really

124
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:31,478
think about you know what what are you

125
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,329
growing what are you growing for and

126
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:38,680
do you brace them at all or what do you

127
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:40,568
use braces or like kind of oh I teach my

128
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,370
plants throughout the growing season you

129
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,348
have to or else you know the wind will

130
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:48,098
pick up and take your whole plant down

131
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:51,788
so I when they're small I put a little

132
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:54,308
small cage and then as soon as you know

133
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:56,558
they start growing I'll put four fence

134
00:06:54,309 --> 00:07:00,729
posts around and put another seven-foot

135
00:06:56,559 --> 00:07:03,460
cage two feet up you know so they have

136
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:05,288
do they take a lot I mean you'd think to

137
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:08,138
grow it plant that big it must use a lot

138
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:10,300
of water is that what you found we're

139
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:13,139
really blessed where we are we have a

140
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,838
huge aquifer underneath the valley and

141
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,939
the well that the wells that we use

142
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:20,918
they're only 50 feet deep right and it

143
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:24,759
like some really sweet water I can just

144
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:26,468
pump them all day and if whatever they

145
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,999
the plants don't use it just goes right

146
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:30,129
back into the water table so I don't

147
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:35,439
really feel bad about overusing water

148
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:38,289
and the way we we water our plants we we

149
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:40,990
use little spaghetti tubes every foot so

150
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:42,908
there's dry spots and wet spots so the

151
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,759
plant takes with it what it wants what

152
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:49,180
it needs and you know do you breed for

153
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,569
big plants - oh absolutely I want big

154
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:55,088
plants i I really enjoy growing you know

155
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:59,680
full full season and seeing how big they

156
00:07:55,088 --> 00:08:01,449
get you know my brother's like to grow

157
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,908
big plants too so it's really nice it's

158
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:09,930
like we're a little competitive family

159
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:12,038
so who grew the biggest planet this year

160
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,959
speaking of that you know your family's

161
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,728
pretty prolific and known and in the

162
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:17,740
area maybe talk about some of the

163
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:20,228
genetics that have come through you and

164
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,288
you're feeling the the jog ooh that's

165
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:27,519
one of my brother Mike's strains that he

166
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:30,370
crossed over 15 years ago collaborated

167
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:34,240
with his good friend Knoll probably a

168
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:36,849
lot of people no no here but you know

169
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,620
since then we've just been taking those

170
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:43,350
seeds and I've been just breeding what I

171
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:45,039
like into him like you know the I like a

172
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,290
Skywalker

173
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,208
do across that with the goo and now I

174
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:52,120
have a Skywalker goo and then there's

175
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:53,948
the develop perps that I grow I've got

176
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,560
crossed that into a lot of the other

177
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:59,349
ones that I grow now so it's just really

178
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,059
fun to see what comes out of you know

179
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,879
what comes out of all the seeds because

180
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:05,198
you never really know it's so much fun

181
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,179
to see what comes out of all the seeds

182
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:09,159
one of the coolest thing about doing the

183
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:11,078
regenitive cannabis farm award and doing

184
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,519
the site visits is like getting to

185
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:14,379
connect with people on all the different

186
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,480
levels from the soil building but the

187
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:18,399
the genetic aspect that gets me really

188
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,100
excited I've been obsessive you know for

189
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,600
twenty years on this and yeah to see the

190
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,980
work that you're doing for a very

191
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,300
specific thing you know what's you

192
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,769
what's you what do you want for your

193
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,508
outcome is always interested like

194
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:29,649
working backwards and you want monster

195
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,120
plants and you're in the perfect place

196
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,458
to do it you have the perfect water

197
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,929
source to do it and like these these are

198
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,909
the legitimately 20-pound plants I've

199
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:38,318
seen them normally I'd be like bullshit

200
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,689
you know how big a 10-pound plant it

201
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:42,370
hidden like and and the flowers are

202
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,709
flawless all the way through to but like

203
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:48,009
there's a lot of selection work going on

204
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:49,899
to to make that happen and what I really

205
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,789
love too is seeing the genetic sharing

206
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,159
like and then like that cultural sharing

207
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:55,599
the background stories of these

208
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,399
different genetics and how they came to

209
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,339
different places and the first time I

210
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,720
met Nick I was with my buddy Brian who

211
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:03,250
does home what seed organization as well

212
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,690
and we gave him some seeds some black

213
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:09,698
dog and some cherry glaze cherries and

214
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,980
you know he's he's made like five F

215
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:13,599
generations off of those as well as

216
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,970
amazing back crosses and I get to see

217
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,220
even those two combined as well as all

218
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,720
kinds of things so I get to see you know

219
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,339
stuff from so long ago turn into all

220
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,019
these other things and every year we you

221
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:24,850
know exchange a few other things and get

222
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:28,688
to see cool things and we just did the

223
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:31,060
same but I love seeing the the sharing

224
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:33,549
between everyone and like Daniel as well

225
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:34,929
just tons of people's stuff all put

226
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,328
together and I see your stuff like a

227
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:39,578
moon gazer and all over the place like

228
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:41,708
it's it's just really cool to see the

229
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:43,419
sharing between the regen farms when it

230
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:46,539
comes to genetics as well as all the

231
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:49,299
information but nick t1 told maybe some

232
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:51,519
stories on some crosses and kind of

233
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:54,969
sharing oh yeah maybe a little bit about

234
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,139
your that amazing that pink but what's

235
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,340
that Thank You Barry

236
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:00,519
didn't matter orig

237
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,620
from Koval originally yeah originally

238
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:08,340
most of my backbone genetics come from

239
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:10,960
Koval oh so definitely yeah so you know

240
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,850
now kind of some of the things I've

241
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,650
focus on so there's this glazed cherries

242
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,060
that I get that's just like the dank you

243
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:19,569
know and and we all know what the dank

244
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:21,759
is it's like that's why it's so good

245
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,830
these days is because everybody who

246
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,269
grows has an eye for the dank in the

247
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,980
dank could mean many things but

248
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:30,100
generally it involves a lot of resin and

249
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,779
a lot of nose and it's always that

250
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,060
special one and those are the selections

251
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:37,029
we as breeders are always hunting to

252
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:40,949
make and but what I'm trying to do now

253
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:43,269
is is understand kind of the technical

254
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,580
components of breeding I grew a lot of

255
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,740
vegetables and I still do but I really

256
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,379
just do it for the homestead and and for

257
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:54,159
my community and sharing and not selling

258
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:57,460
vegetables anymore and and focusing

259
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,679
specifically you know might work on on

260
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,879
the cannabis but I you know we have

261
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:05,829
inbred lines we have F ones and we have

262
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,600
poly hybrids and to understand these

263
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,910
different terminology is really

264
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,560
important for a breeder right so I grow

265
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:15,789
all from seed so I'm really interested

266
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:17,829
in in uniformity not so much I've never

267
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:20,949
grown a clone so I'm obviously not that

268
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,840
interested in it however there is some

269
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,810
benefits to having some uniformity and

270
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,550
as I go further with breeding I'm I look

271
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,259
into this stuff and I do some research

272
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:32,199
and I try to understand you know how

273
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:36,789
come the catalogs that you buy your

274
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,830
vegetables from our F ones and and then

275
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:42,159
they're super uniform and they have

276
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:44,470
their own name and the reason that is is

277
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,750
there's a technical way to go about that

278
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,490
process and in cannabis you get an F one

279
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,379
and it might express wildly and it's

280
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,330
then it's not really an F one so it's

281
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:54,039
like we have to start understanding

282
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,040
these the language and how we're saying

283
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:59,709
here's this it's it's an F one even

284
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,159
though both cuts that were used to make

285
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,139
it

286
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,360
we're both poly hybrid it's not really

287
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:06,069
an f1 so you're not going to get that

288
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,879
uniformity so I've been working on

289
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:12,300
trying to stabilize and in breed further

290
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:16,029
lines and that just means generationally

291
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:18,879
sibling crossing these plants with the

292
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:21,279
selections that I make to further the

293
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,110
whatever it was called when I got it and

294
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,269
whether it was truly what it was when I

295
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:28,750
got it or not it's hard to say in this

296
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:31,269
culture however the further we do

297
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,370
continue to in breed those lines and

298
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,929
then use those inbred lines as our

299
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,129
breeding stock to create commercial

300
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:41,679
production lines that are more about

301
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:43,899
hybrid vigor that's when you know we're

302
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,599
coming into like okay I want to grow all

303
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:49,000
from seed well I want to grow F ones if

304
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,800
I'm doing this for the market just

305
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,649
because it's from a business standpoint

306
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,329
the most efficient from seed type of

307
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:57,789
seed to be running in your production

308
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:00,910
field but I need to maintain these

309
00:13:57,789 --> 00:14:03,909
inbred lines and as many varieties as

310
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:06,669
possible so that I can continue to

311
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:10,000
create new F ones and now those F ones

312
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:12,819
become the things that you name and then

313
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,220
you have a lot of work to stabilize that

314
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,440
new variety into its own breeding stock

315
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,960
so you might change the name of

316
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,580
something with a f1 cross in order to

317
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,200
because the further in bread you go the

318
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,200
more predictable the traits in which

319
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,090
you're breeding with become and so two

320
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,920
inbred lines that are stable and I don't

321
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,440
even really work with deeply inbred

322
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,689
lines I'm talking at four f5 f6 and I

323
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,460
only grow outdoor and I don't use light

324
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,230
manipulation so I'm not running multiple

325
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:46,870
generations in a year and hurrying that

326
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:50,980
process along but the further inbred you

327
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,629
go the more reliable real f1 you get so

328
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,940
I think in a kromagg recalled sure it's

329
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:58,090
like you go to f9 before you create an

330
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,790
f1 and so you go to f9 with two very

331
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:03,970
different things and that cross of those

332
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:07,029
two F nines becomes a new variety that's

333
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,590
an f1 and now you could stabilize that

334
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:10,649
and make that a different variety but

335
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:15,370
how many generations you gotta go a

336
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:17,019
bunch like f9 in agriculture so I just

337
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,360
want to share this information as I

338
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,500
learn it in the process help you guys

339
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,480
understand what you're looking at

340
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,639
you see these and ask your breeders more

341
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,289
in-depth questions about what are you

342
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,610
talking about when you say backcross I'm

343
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:30,500
trying to get the bottom of this you

344
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,029
know like what does that mean it seems

345
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,940
to mean something different to everybody

346
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:37,879
so how many how many plants are you

347
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,010
talking about like two when you're going

348
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,379
back like how many plants do you how

349
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:44,059
many seeds are you planting and how many

350
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:46,340
plants are you looking at to kind of

351
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:47,419
make these determinations from so you

352
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,519
know I'm not working with huge

353
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:52,969
populations but I have a 20,000 square

354
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,949
foot production canopy and I pop about a

355
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,480
hundred seeds per variety each year

356
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,520
that's a pretty good sift as far as I'm

357
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,310
concerned in comparison to we yeah and

358
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:04,939
also in terms of just observing and what

359
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:06,889
you can see I have a question for Daniel

360
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,640
as we're talking about this and that is

361
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:14,059
is the intuitive side and now we could

362
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,559
just run a bunch of numbers and and and

363
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:16,609
also go that route but then there's also

364
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,919
just luck

365
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,169
there's just the intuitive side of okay

366
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,659
it's it's there it's gonna show itself

367
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:26,509
and I'm curious to know how you work

368
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:28,309
with intuition inbreeding well you know

369
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:31,909
and it's also because my older brother

370
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:34,039
was the numbers guy and he really read

371
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:35,870
every book there was and he knew like

372
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,189
okay I'm gonna take this I'm gonna cross

373
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,929
it but then when I get this I'm gonna

374
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,510
bring out this trait and I'm just like

375
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:44,838
what do you want to be pollinated with

376
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:47,889
plant and you know but but like Nick I'm

377
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:50,839
learning the science now you know and

378
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:52,939
it's it's fun and but I've always

379
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,540
considered myself to be a plant

380
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,950
whisperer

381
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:56,480
so if you're the science people out

382
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,800
there learn how to talk to the plants

383
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,379
and you know if you're the plant people

384
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:05,448
you know learn the numbers and it's you

385
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:07,609
know in league and we've been just

386
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:09,680
making seeds but it was like a branch or

387
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,149
two you know we were harvesting pollen

388
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,910
maybe from eight males in pre

389
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,160
legalization and now it's 50 different

390
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:19,519
males multiple plants for seventy-five

391
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,610
different males and you know but I only

392
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:26,150
see maybe ten percent of you know

393
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:29,149
growing out ten to forty plants per seed

394
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:33,140
lot and finding one or two out of those

395
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,370
that is worthy of pollen because each

396
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,770
year when you

397
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:39,289
cross it the expression is a little

398
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:41,420
different and so one thing is just

399
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,950
librarian and holding on to some because

400
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,170
then a few years down the road you like

401
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,269
you know that one year that was the year

402
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,340
that was really good and thank goodness

403
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:51,980
I got some seeds I can go back and and

404
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:54,349
plant those again well yet that was you

405
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,870
know in taking your lines different ways

406
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:58,219
though if you get down here to f6 and

407
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:59,419
it's not good you have a couple other

408
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,950
options to work with especially

409
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:06,320
something you know special that you like

410
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:10,279
you my own shy so many things that we

411
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:20,058
could be crossing all the time and maybe

412
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:23,240
like how do you stay focused I don't

413
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:25,789
know I just go for it you know but it's

414
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,529
also you know like a Kelly from

415
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:29,808
dragonfly Earth Medicine she uses her

416
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:32,269
like dowsing rod over the artha pendulum

417
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:34,910
over the seeds but I'm just hoping

418
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:36,920
actually to get more space so I you know

419
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:40,850
don't have to pick and choose I can just

420
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,410
start them all dan really goes for it by

421
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:44,869
the way like I was walking through the

422
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,519
host plants it's like there's so much

423
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:49,069
right there's so much it's like hard to

424
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:51,049
like fully take it in and I'm a total

425
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:53,269
whirlwind with all that insanity I knew

426
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:53,869
I have an exceptional memory like an

427
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:56,029
elephant

428
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:57,379
well proper labeling is really important

429
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:59,269
to like when you realize or something

430
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,130
like from four years ago and you just

431
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:02,929
have those right numbers and letters on

432
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:08,300
there to know that it was the one that

433
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:09,950
you're looking at me I'm starting to map

434
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:14,029
out the family tree as it you know

435
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,740
before it gets away from me yeah Forest

436
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:19,639
do you want to answer to respond to the

437
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:22,519
question as well so my breeding I don't

438
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,640
do it very scientific either it's more

439
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:28,700
of just what I like in the garden and I

440
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:32,150
kind of just go with my gut and see

441
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:39,650
where it leads me and it's so far it's

442
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:42,710
it's been it's worked out yeah I don't

443
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:44,720
crack so many seeds every year the most

444
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,220
I crack is probably like 500

445
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,380
and I usually don't even plant that many

446
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:56,579
because I don't need that many

447
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:58,470
so my breeding isn't as vast but I still

448
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:02,179
have a lot of good stuff to breed with

449
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:04,920
so I I just go with what I feel really

450
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,620
and for unique how do you find that

451
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,550
balance between in intuition and numbers

452
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:13,289
I think they're both extremely valid and

453
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:14,970
we all probably have started from more

454
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:19,289
of an intuitive place and just like

455
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,730
selecting the dank there's no way a

456
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:22,740
single breeder would like walk around

457
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:28,559
and be like look at that crazy resin

458
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:30,660
monster and be like that so you know

459
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,629
that that's the intuitive pieces like we

460
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,700
all know what that is if we've been

461
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,350
growing you you'll know if you haven't

462
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,120
grown you should grow some and you'll

463
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:41,759
see one that stands out and you'll be

464
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,109
like well that's the one and that's what

465
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,150
we make seeds with or that's what we'll

466
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:48,569
focus on really elite lines and maybe

467
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,820
that's what the elite line is you pop 44

468
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:53,159
of them are amazing those are your elite

469
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:55,289
lines you're gonna wanna make seed with

470
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,900
those I've just been doing that for a

471
00:20:55,289 --> 00:21:01,109
while now so like from seed I could

472
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:04,680
pretty reliably get a pretty and I've

473
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:06,990
got I can get just good numbers I can

474
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,299
you know and the COAS have been helpful

475
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:12,769
for that so like this whole marrying

476
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:15,240
science and intuition it's really and

477
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:17,519
like daniel said you know if you're

478
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,289
super scientific you should focus on

479
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,509
balancing that and if you're super

480
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,889
intuitive you should focus on balancing

481
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:26,069
that because somewhere in the middle is

482
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,080
where the real magic really starts to

483
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:30,569
come together because even as I've

484
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:34,019
gotten more say into the language and

485
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:36,359
terminology of breeding it's really made

486
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:40,710
a difference from how I'm doing it so

487
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:42,689
it's like you know it I am a production

488
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:45,180
farmer and I do provide for the market

489
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,220
so there is a certain pressure of test

490
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,890
results maintain a certain level well if

491
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,480
I get a multi Fino batch tested I get a

492
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,640
good understanding of the potency of

493
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,819
that genetic I might not know what every

494
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,230
single plant is in terms of its quantity

495
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:00,839
of cannabinoids

496
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:05,569
but I know that within that genetic I'm

497
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:08,970
seeing this this range of potency and

498
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:10,740
and then there's this important

499
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,509
component where you got to work with the

500
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,269
ones that aren't that dank but have

501
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:16,740
unique characteristics because those are

502
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:19,679
the ones that you're gonna want to take

503
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,919
and work with those really elite things

504
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,280
to bring new completely new expressions

505
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:29,250
around and so if you're buying I BLS or

506
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,230
inbred lines for your seed stock just

507
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,970
understand those are probably bottle

508
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,950
necked pretty good and have gone in a

509
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:37,048
less vigorous direction but they're

510
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,929
probably more uniform and stable to some

511
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:42,808
extent across the board but don't expect

512
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:46,490
as much from them and if you really want

513
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:49,619
to be expecting commercial viable

514
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:51,950
uniformity that act similarly to each

515
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:55,649
other and have similar structure then

516
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:58,048
look at the F ones and that's just in in

517
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:01,530
general how agriculture has been working

518
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:03,750
so open pollinated varieties and F ones

519
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:08,399
or what you see in seed catalogs if you

520
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,869
see nobody sees f2 f3 f4 on beet that's

521
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,910
not something that generally gets

522
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:13,979
brought to market that's something

523
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,470
that's being worked into something that

524
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,960
ends up bringing to market cannabis

525
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:21,870
right now poly hybrids though are really

526
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,029
important if you're just growing to find

527
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:27,329
an elite cut that you want to just keep

528
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:29,129
as a clone get poly hybrids and they

529
00:23:27,329 --> 00:23:31,529
should be cheaper people aren't working

530
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:34,380
that hard unless they really have put

531
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:36,298
time into some but I'm like if it's a

532
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,860
poly hybrid or a double poly hybrid or

533
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:40,650
there's multiple parents on one side

534
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:42,359
multi-well on the other like unless you

535
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,740
were the one that created those parents

536
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,229
you didn't do that much work to make it

537
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,900
because any of us can buy some seed from

538
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,269
you and some seed from you and then mix

539
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,860
them and make some incredible cannabis

540
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:55,259
and we should all be doing that that's

541
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:57,779
our that's really seed preservation work

542
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:00,839
is a lot of people doing that we can

543
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:04,319
sort it all out anytime in the future if

544
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:06,418
we have the seeds that's the work that

545
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,450
we can go further into doing so I just

546
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,380
encourage everybody to buy seeds grow

547
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,660
seeds

548
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:24,990
and make seeds and then our future

549
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:27,540
should be more secure it's it's really

550
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,279
cool just one of the things is there's

551
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,990
now that we've entered this age of

552
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,269
commercial cannabis there's kind of this

553
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,240
wanting to just hold on to what you have

554
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:38,670
and not share it and whatnot and this

555
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,410
culture of sharing that we have is

556
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,970
important and I'm just wondering what

557
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:46,080
your thoughts are moving into the future

558
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:49,529
into this just into capitalism and and

559
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,779
also we're sharing but then also how do

560
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:57,509
we balance sharing as well as making a

561
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:58,980
profit well you know it's interesting in

562
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:00,839
the cannabis industry now you know

563
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,640
people go oh big business in cannabis

564
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:03,119
what a shame I like no big business what

565
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,800
a shame

566
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,029
you know the whole the whole world over

567
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,309
and they're you know we're definitely

568
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:12,119
like on the brink of destruction because

569
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:14,779
of predatory capitalism but you know

570
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:17,669
sharing seeds with your friends and and

571
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:21,389
selling your best seeds to the community

572
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:22,620
you know you're gonna take something and

573
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,680
go a totally different way than I'm

574
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:29,459
gonna take something and you know it's

575
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:31,170
there's so much creativity within a seed

576
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,269
that you can really go any direction

577
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,269
with it yeah I feel the same

578
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:43,490
[Applause]

579
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:46,638
yeah really I really feel like sharing

580
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:52,609
is the direction that we need to go you

581
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:54,648
know like I just got some seeds from bio

582
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:58,579
vortex and then I just crossed them and

583
00:25:54,648 --> 00:26:02,449
gave them back you know great name he's

584
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:04,009
got but he gave me the Voltron and then

585
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,220
I crossed it with my velvet perps and

586
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:08,628
now he's got velvet Ron velvet Ron you

587
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,210
know we're all stoked

588
00:26:08,628 --> 00:26:13,638
so both multi-on and velvet Ron are in

589
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:17,120
the calendar I mean and that's their

590
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:21,079
spell that hurts girl mysoline parts and

591
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:24,378
then there's Voltron run by high-water

592
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:26,628
farms dry farms - full circle the

593
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:29,240
sharing is also important because I've

594
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:31,730
heard stories from other farmers of how

595
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,730
they've lost genetics because they did

596
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,929
not share them and then years down they

597
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,250
come back later and they're like wow

598
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,820
you've been growing this for all these

599
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,470
years

600
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:42,230
oh my god there's that genetic that I I

601
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,778
thought I lost and so those are those

602
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,788
are some pretty yeah that's it's good

603
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:49,669
it's good to share and follow your heart

604
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:52,308
and find partners with that you all

605
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:55,639
share the same values in in California

606
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:57,138
on production scale of it I can't make

607
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:59,028
enough of one cultivator to make a

608
00:26:57,138 --> 00:27:01,729
difference you know and I got some

609
00:26:59,028 --> 00:27:03,019
velvet purp seeds from forest and I'm

610
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,579
gonna grow a batch of it out for

611
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:06,259
production and it's not gonna mess with

612
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:07,699
his bottom line at all it's gonna help

613
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:09,980
him get his name out there because I'll

614
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,778
give him credit for it and you know then

615
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,788
and I cross that with my auto flower

616
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:16,069
genetics and I'm gonna be happy the day

617
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:25,339
I can hand them back and an auto flower

618
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:28,278
velvet perps so hold on I wanted those

619
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:30,230
jump on that just cuz the question it's

620
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:32,808
just that this whole weird place where

621
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:37,308
it's like valuing your work being

622
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:39,378
supported and sharing and and and then

623
00:27:37,308 --> 00:27:43,158
the fear that comes in that people have

624
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:47,028
about oh my seed ends up here I'm like

625
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:49,220
if somebody's supporting you by by

626
00:27:47,028 --> 00:27:50,628
purchasing and they take your seeds and

627
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,410
make more seeds with it that's like the

628
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:55,939
biggest on

629
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:59,120
so you know we should all be doing that

630
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:03,470
and nobody owns it like I'm tired of

631
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:08,509
this like greedy eyeballs over genetics

632
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:11,240
like but at the same time we need to

633
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:13,430
value the genetics that are take that

634
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,109
are being given all this work and so we

635
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,990
have to understand how to support that

636
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:21,559
process too because you know not

637
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:25,250
everybody's as obsessed maybe as some of

638
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:28,039
us up here around how much time we spend

639
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:30,829
with pollen so there's a lot of tricks

640
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:34,190
around that too and and all the

641
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:36,649
techniques to maintain less pollen drift

642
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,320
and to still have a viable crop within a

643
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,420
production zone for the market you know

644
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:42,769
all this stuff comes into consideration

645
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:46,970
as you're breeding and you realize that

646
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:49,099
I Wow Manas a few seeds over here whoops

647
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,620
you know it happens but I've never

648
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:53,089
gotten a single complaint in the market

649
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:55,629
everybody has only giving me positive

650
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:58,789
feedback when they found seeds but

651
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:01,340
nobody owns the seeds we just take care

652
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:03,409
of them and help them but the power is

653
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:05,149
through nature that's what design them

654
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:12,769
that's what created them and we're just

655
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:15,350
here to help them along so and the seeds

656
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:19,430
- they're not in track and trace so

657
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:21,889
share them your home growers you can

658
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:24,019
have your seed production going on as

659
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:26,750
home growers and sharing amongst

660
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:28,279
yourselves so yeah there's the seeds

661
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,019
through there they're free so in the

662
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:33,129
regenerative cannabis calendar that we

663
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:35,690
do I get to feature all these farms and

664
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,910
get different information from them - I

665
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,380
share my own but Nick wrote this really

666
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,930
cool thing on regenerative breeding

667
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,820
points but the the quote we have here is

668
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,350
somewhere something incredible is

669
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:47,809
waiting to be known just the potential

670
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:50,029
inside of seeds is so amazing the value

671
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:52,250
that comes out of a seed blows me away

672
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:54,470
to see something he worked on years ago

673
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,900
all over the world and to see it on

674
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,690
beautiful farms with polyculture to see

675
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,280
that's sharing with other people it's

676
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,820
one of my favorite things it warms my

677
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,230
heart as an artist and a human but

678
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:07,490
want you to read these regenerative

679
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,750
points if you could because they're

680
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,120
really really thoughtful and I

681
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,460
appreciate you putting that together

682
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:16,069
yeah so this is just when I think the

683
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,399
term regenerative reading I'm like what

684
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:21,349
is that's such a interesting term right

685
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:23,239
like we're all trying to figure out what

686
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:25,308
that is and we all realize we're

687
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,099
striving for regenerative and not really

688
00:30:25,308 --> 00:30:30,048
there yet as a culture as a people we've

689
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:31,638
got a few generations before we end up

690
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:33,558
in this regenerative space that we all

691
00:30:31,638 --> 00:30:36,199
want to be in just based on the

692
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:37,788
infrastructure of society and capitalism

693
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,889
and if you get involved in selling

694
00:30:37,788 --> 00:30:42,169
things you got packaging trail that's

695
00:30:39,888 --> 00:30:45,158
pretty long and pretty much offsets all

696
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:49,399
your potential regenerative qualities

697
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:51,549
but regenerative breeding points I said

698
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:54,589
grow plants in the natural light cycle

699
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:55,878
that's all I do I don't manipulate the

700
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:57,500
light I don't you don't have to start

701
00:30:55,878 --> 00:30:59,418
them inside under lights wait until

702
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,308
April they want to wake up later if they

703
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:03,830
don't start outside it's because it's

704
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:05,869
too cold you manipulate their life cycle

705
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:08,388
you don't know what they do naturally so

706
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:11,028
for me regenerative is about natural

707
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:12,918
processes so I'm only real really

708
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:16,190
interested in how they work naturally

709
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:19,250
with the with the earth and my climate

710
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:21,500
and and I just give myself to that whole

711
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:24,859
process and even though it's hard and

712
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,138
not everything works its worth it so

713
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:28,668
when they were talking regenerative yeah

714
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:31,099
is that the best technique in the world

715
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:33,950
for specific things maybe not but we're

716
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:35,750
talking regenerative make intentional

717
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,360
breeding selections by setting goals for

718
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:41,028
desired outcomes like mold and disease

719
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:43,369
resistant structure color aroma have a

720
00:31:41,028 --> 00:31:45,048
goal if you're breeding have some kind

721
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:46,548
of goal you know it might be to make

722
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:48,980
poly hybrids and then you don't need to

723
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:50,628
be that specific you meet your goal you

724
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,849
might make another goal and at some

725
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:54,138
point it changes and so just as long as

726
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:55,548
you have a direction you're going you

727
00:31:54,138 --> 00:31:58,819
can at least be making a selection

728
00:31:55,548 --> 00:32:02,388
that's not just like I think this one

729
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:04,099
you know use multiple males when

730
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:06,558
collecting pollen to strengthen the gene

731
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:08,869
pool you know this is important in the

732
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:12,859
long term seed making of inbred lines

733
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:14,808
especially many many males gives you

734
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:16,128
some more genetic diversity and after

735
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:18,589
you've bottle necked you want to try to

736
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,949
which is just reducing to say

737
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:23,480
male one female you might start

738
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,000
selecting more males and you might start

739
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,329
selecting similar-looking males but more

740
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,788
males is better than fewer so increasing

741
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:34,519
that male population as it's possible

742
00:32:31,788 --> 00:32:36,140
the legality of all this cannabis stuff

743
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:38,599
puts a lot of restrictions on our

744
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:41,600
methodology in terms of what we can act

745
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:42,980
can and can't do so you know I wish I

746
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:50,558
could save a lot more males than I do

747
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:53,990
but such is the case some some day I say

748
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:56,028
pollinate feel females mid-august to mid

749
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,798
September getting past mid September

750
00:32:56,028 --> 00:33:00,159
you're starting to run into that moldy

751
00:32:57,798 --> 00:33:02,480
time so seeds aren't going to mature

752
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,110
before they start molding so you just

753
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,669
have less viable seeds now you could

754
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,798
still get some seeds and for a home

755
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:10,490
scale that's great but if you wanted to

756
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:12,558
make seeds

757
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,980
you got to pollinate that with like five

758
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:18,769
to you you want five to six weeks of

759
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:20,538
post pollination development if you

760
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:22,278
don't have that then you just end up

761
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:24,048
with a bunch of immature seeds and if

762
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:25,429
you pollinate too late you have a bunch

763
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:28,009
of seeds on the outside of the bud that

764
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:29,360
are immature not ideal it's always sucks

765
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:31,190
when you're cleaning seeds and only

766
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:34,178
three or four of the thousand you made

767
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:36,890
are good we probably all done it I have

768
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:39,019
lower south facing branches tend to be

769
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:42,110
the best I mean just full Sun best

770
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:45,019
conditions less mold and the north side

771
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:46,609
of the plant and the seeds make the buds

772
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:49,369
tighter when they're really well seated

773
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:52,389
so you run into more mold on seeded

774
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:54,769
branches and so keeping those in the

775
00:33:52,390 --> 00:34:00,409
more sunlight is going to be a better

776
00:33:54,769 --> 00:34:02,089
place to get more seeds clean seed and

777
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:04,039
Loco this is important so when you're

778
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:05,480
packing your seeds are making seeds for

779
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:08,418
packs and you're you're just saving

780
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,230
seeds you know manage your climate low

781
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:12,289
humidity

782
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,579
if you pack up a bunch of seeds and 85%

783
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:15,409
humidity they're probably not going to

784
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:17,119
be viable for very long because they're

785
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:19,338
trapped in some plastic or something

786
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,829
that doesn't breathe and the humidity is

787
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:23,539
too high in there so just make it a

788
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:25,398
point to run your dehumidifier when

789
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:26,690
you're packaging your seeds so that when

790
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:28,878
you package them and put them in that

791
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:32,358
sealed container those things are good

792
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:34,878
when they open up a point to that too if

793
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:36,710
using glass and your refrigerating or

794
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,268
freezing it like you make need to make

795
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,068
sure that that container comes to room

796
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:41,808
temperature and that room is dry before

797
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:43,128
you open it because it'll just suck all

798
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:45,109
that moisture and seems true with

799
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:47,148
flowers and hash too but just be mindful

800
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:48,768
of it coming to room temperature and it

801
00:34:47,148 --> 00:34:50,268
being low humidity when you open it yeah

802
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:52,008
pull your seat if you store them in the

803
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:54,408
fridge which I do store pull them out

804
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:56,389
and let them sit for five hours actually

805
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:58,009
keeping a D hung on before you even open

806
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:01,390
the fridge is good too so no moisture

807
00:34:58,009 --> 00:35:03,498
goes in when you open the door and then

808
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:05,778
final just like you want to store your

809
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:07,488
seeds for long-term viability at one

810
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:10,429
make sure they were packaged or they're

811
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:12,349
stored in low humidity and then they'll

812
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:14,268
remain that way for a long time

813
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:16,039
cool temperatures are great you can

814
00:35:14,268 --> 00:35:17,988
freeze not a big deal I wouldn't be

815
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:20,869
getting in the practice of freezing

816
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:22,940
thawing freezing thawing too much but

817
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:25,460
it's freezing is probably the longest

818
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,230
term if you wanted to put like I want

819
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,539
this seed bank to be available in 50

820
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:32,539
years it'll likely be just fine after 50

821
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:34,670
years it was put in the freezer dry now

822
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:38,509
for me I'm mostly storing most of my

823
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:40,249
seeds just in a refrigerator and making

824
00:35:38,509 --> 00:35:42,679
sure that they were packaged right

825
00:35:40,248 --> 00:35:44,419
before they go in there so and I've

826
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:46,038
changed my packaging over the years and

827
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,259
been playing with that with that and

828
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:50,630
then I the final tip is just breed every

829
00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:52,568
year it's really important because right

830
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,519
now that climate is changing rapidly

831
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:57,829
there's a lot of information that comes

832
00:35:55,518 --> 00:36:00,048
to the seeds every season if you just

833
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:02,089
like keep one seed stock and are always

834
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:03,588
working off of that that's fine you

835
00:36:02,088 --> 00:36:05,389
might find but man what about the

836
00:36:03,588 --> 00:36:07,880
evolution of cannabis that's what I'm

837
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:09,528
really interested in I rarely am jumping

838
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,329
back into my old banks and being like

839
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:13,039
man I'm gonna go back and hit that

840
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:15,470
unlike way more excited about all these

841
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,239
projects and all the information that

842
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:19,669
came with the season that's wrapped up

843
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:21,980
in that seed and then that's the

844
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,220
medicine when we smoke gives us the

845
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:27,498
information that we need from the planet

846
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:31,488
in current time so we're trying to get

847
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:33,498
our updates from our plants as evolved

848
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:36,108
as possible and especially with the

849
00:36:33,498 --> 00:36:38,988
client changing climate to continue that

850
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:42,880
evolution as much as we can so that's

851
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:42,880
some breeding that's fantastic yeah

852
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:48,429
and a good joints a great tool for

853
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:51,519
breeding - just knowing the flavor and

854
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:53,379
the effects spray bottle a spray bottle

855
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:55,748
for pollen collectors you spray yourself

856
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,278
off it to mess with pollen because I'll

857
00:36:55,748 --> 00:36:59,078
be in and out of the garden and if I

858
00:36:57,278 --> 00:37:01,690
don't spray myself down then everything

859
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:04,269
gets a little bit of seed I just have

860
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:06,009
one thing to add that's we notice you

861
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:08,558
know going from making a branch to

862
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:11,079
seeding whole plants that you know just

863
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:14,920
like a mom with you know carrying a baby

864
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:17,499
they needed more food and so seeds for

865
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,880
seeds we we sprout barley or you know

866
00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:20,978
you can do sunflower whatever you have

867
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,170
you know in about two ounces of sprouted

868
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:24,759
seeds blend it up at add it to five

869
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,798
gallons of water and you feed it to your

870
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:29,920
heavily seeded plants and they will

871
00:37:26,798 --> 00:37:31,538
mature top to the bottom quicker you

872
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,869
know on either side of the plant and

873
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:42,130
shady or parts of your farm you know so

874
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:47,430
give them those prenatals you know just

875
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:50,588
some some techniques I usually just

876
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:52,690
pollinate one branch at a time like I'll

877
00:37:50,588 --> 00:37:54,670
just select like the best plant that I

878
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,599
like and pollinate just one little

879
00:37:54,670 --> 00:38:03,309
branch so I'm not pollinating a whole

880
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:05,140
you know big tree okay well I want to

881
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:07,420
open it up to questions from the

882
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:12,338
audience but before we do I was going to

883
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:14,528
have Daniel read us a poem yeah so this

884
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:17,558
is my ode to Luther Burbank who was a

885
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,818
local Sonoma County uh legend and you

886
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:21,069
know probably worldwide you can plant

887
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:23,739
botanists not with cannabis but you know

888
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:27,579
he's done amazing things and this poem

889
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:29,289
was called love shapes the world apart

890
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:32,949
from scientific knowledge love

891
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:34,239
accelerates evolution Luther Burbank do

892
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:37,119
you know how he made the spineless

893
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:40,179
cactus listen to his words and I will

894
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,608
tell you I often spoke to the plant

895
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:44,919
create a vibration of love you do not

896
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:48,670
need your defensive thorns I would tell

897
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,650
them I will protect you and gradually

898
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:54,570
one generation the useful plant of the

899
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:57,150
desert emerged in a thornless variety

900
00:38:54,570 --> 00:39:00,809
do you see just how love shapes the

901
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:02,670
world someday the future we will inherit

902
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:06,179
is shaped by our collective thoughts and

903
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:09,659
actions so speak wisely step tenderly in

904
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:12,509
love without measure and someday when we

905
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:14,339
are kind enough gentle enough and every

906
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:31,890
thought and action is imbued with such

907
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:35,210
love this world will drop its thorns are

908
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:38,969
there some questions from the audience

909
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:50,820
you can come to this mic here if you

910
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:52,739
have a question yeah I mean you you you

911
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,880
have to when you harvest it from the

912
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:56,519
mail you gotta want you want to pull out

913
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,130
the plant matter or any bugs and and you

914
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,599
know store it I don't like to take mine

915
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,890
in and out of the fridge you know but

916
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,869
it's only good for a couple months and

917
00:40:01,889 --> 00:40:06,179
then you can freeze it and then it's

918
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:08,069
only good once and usually only you've

919
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:10,079
got like 20 minutes on there and you

920
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:13,019
know keep it not cold and then in yeah I

921
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,900
used over 45 different types of frozen

922
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:18,659
pollen on my auto flower project this

923
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,300
summer do you do you dry it just a

924
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:22,379
little bit I mean yeah it it dries yeah

925
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,360
a little bit yeah because you don't

926
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,160
before you can put it on put in jars

927
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,660
with moisture packets because and then

928
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,309
you know you'll find out if you didn't

929
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:32,069
if it wasn't dry pretty you know pretty

930
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:37,320
cool stuff in is no good it's gonna mold

931
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:38,789
uh yeah Paulin similar to seeds if it's

932
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,940
humid out you know probably don't want

933
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:43,800
to collect it and you know and store it

934
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,800
but if it's dry out you're likely gonna

935
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,200
have a better storage result so also

936
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,269
letting the pollen fall naturally from

937
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,839
the flowers and then making sure you get

938
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:56,670
the flowers out of the pollen so waiting

939
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,289
for it to drop on its own is a really

940
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,820
important step I mean I know when I was

941
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,590
really excited and starting I would like

942
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,640
be like there's a flower and I'd start

943
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:06,099
milking that stuff out of there

944
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:07,748
it's not the way to go growing in a wet

945
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:10,269
environment - like you really see how

946
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:11,558
the males they they choose their time to

947
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,968
release just right they they pay

948
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:15,160
attention is like okay it's about to be

949
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:17,409
warm and dry or about to get a breeze

950
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:18,699
just paying attention - and a lot of

951
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:20,108
times they're just like no we're holding

952
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:22,118
on to all this pollen because it just

953
00:41:20,108 --> 00:41:23,828
would immediately be wasted and on a hot

954
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:27,219
day we definitely want to be watching

955
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:29,079
them they will pop on a hot day I was

956
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:31,838
just wondering if there's too dry for

957
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:34,269
seed storage is it okay to get it

958
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:36,818
SuperDuper dry I don't know if too dry

959
00:41:34,268 --> 00:41:37,778
I'm always like Oh drier but maybe you

960
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:45,429
know some more about that

961
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:47,829
I'll just go dry area dry I've never

962
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:49,358
seen anything dry not be a good thing in

963
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:53,200
the seed Department but I've seen

964
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:56,170
moisture ruin seeds how how about your

965
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,118
pollen drift just in your garden if

966
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,519
you're in in the commercial market and

967
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,489
you get some seeds in your buds

968
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:08,318
how are you separating that okay or how

969
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:10,900
is that going Paul in drift you have to

970
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,788
be like if you're actually bringing your

971
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,729
flower to shelf there definitely needs

972
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:18,160
to be a series of checks on its way into

973
00:42:15,728 --> 00:42:20,468
your final bag and on its way to the

974
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:24,098
retailer and that's increased for us

975
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:27,400
more as we've done it longer so that's

976
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:29,229
important we had we do you know that

977
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,999
gets caught likely in the trimming room

978
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:32,798
but the way to prevent that is to

979
00:42:30,998 --> 00:42:35,048
understand when to pollinate and maybe

980
00:42:32,798 --> 00:42:37,989
that's born crucial information really

981
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:40,268
is like your your pollinating I'm

982
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:43,869
pollinating in the morning in calm

983
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:45,788
weather and I used to do the evening but

984
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:48,430
I've kind of like it seems like that

985
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:49,660
mornings are nice and instill so that

986
00:42:48,429 --> 00:42:51,879
seems to be the time that I've been

987
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:53,129
working with it and get away with less

988
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,900
haul and drift

989
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:58,930
I'm also again the spray bottle I can't

990
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,630
encourage and emphasize enough just the

991
00:42:58,929 --> 00:43:03,429
spray bottle mentality I'm I'm a freak

992
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:06,759
about spraying myself now because of

993
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:08,788
pollen drift in the past question back

994
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:08,789
there

995
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,858
where my farm at in Potter Valley you

996
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,990
know where the end of a dirt road and

997
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:19,519
there's a cattle ranch and the National

998
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:21,048
Forest and we get you know we're close

999
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,449
enough to the coast where we get the

1000
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:26,298
prevailing westerlies so the males are

1001
00:43:23,449 --> 00:43:29,298
way up there and flowers are over here

1002
00:43:26,298 --> 00:43:31,068
and in diligence to let you know and you

1003
00:43:29,298 --> 00:43:32,630
know you're checking your males in a hot

1004
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:35,599
day you're checking them two three times

1005
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:37,519
a day and then I like once they open are

1006
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,440
start to open or right before they open

1007
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,829
I'll cut them jar them and take them

1008
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,568
inside

1009
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:44,269
or they still get some light and they'll

1010
00:43:41,568 --> 00:43:47,568
finish flowering and drop a lot of

1011
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:49,338
pollen and and then I get up early in

1012
00:43:47,568 --> 00:43:51,079
the morning and now they got the weather

1013
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:52,670
apps too so I'll get up and I'm

1014
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:54,170
pollinating the wind picks up I check

1015
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,420
the weather app it'll be still in an

1016
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:57,798
hour and sure enough to win stopped or

1017
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,930
you know check the weather app the night

1018
00:43:57,798 --> 00:44:00,730
before for mile an hour winds no thank

1019
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:03,289
you

1020
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:05,599
and then when you get on the still

1021
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:08,088
morning and there's no when and you dip

1022
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,470
your paintbrush into the pollen and you

1023
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:11,179
can tap it you can literally see the

1024
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:12,348
paul and just fall straight down on the

1025
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:19,399
plant and you know it doesn't go

1026
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:21,710
anywhere but right there so we live in

1027
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,680
the valley where we do get some drift

1028
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:27,798
from other gardens it's kind of

1029
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:30,440
inevitable so we do find some seed here

1030
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:33,349
and there but it's really not that big a

1031
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,349
deal one year it was a little bit more

1032
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:41,240
than others but most of all it's been

1033
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:44,119
pretty good for my pollen production I

1034
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:47,088
usually just keep my males like off to

1035
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:49,760
the side smaller and then just bring

1036
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:53,568
them in side right before they pop so I

1037
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:56,540
don't get that drift so keeping them

1038
00:44:53,568 --> 00:45:00,679
separate and maybe downwind from the

1039
00:44:56,539 --> 00:45:03,139
prevailing wind is important having a

1040
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:05,000
good like wall of like plants or foilage

1041
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:06,949
around or just any kind of block pollen

1042
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,409
is actually static charge so it actually

1043
00:45:06,949 --> 00:45:11,989
wants to cling to things and so just a

1044
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:14,029
lot of like trees or branches and or

1045
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:17,588
walls like will actually stop a decent

1046
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:20,450
amount do either of you use the

1047
00:45:17,588 --> 00:45:24,159
biodynamic calendar like do you maybe

1048
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:25,518
pollinate more often on a flower moon

1049
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:30,398
have you see

1050
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:32,558
you use the the biodynamic calendar or

1051
00:45:30,398 --> 00:45:36,949
yeah

1052
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:39,019
we do go by the by tenement calendar for

1053
00:45:36,949 --> 00:45:41,179
some things but for pollination I

1054
00:45:39,018 --> 00:45:44,658
haven't done it yet but maybe I will

1055
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:46,579
this year I have in the past in this

1056
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:48,559
year I slipped a little bit I wasn't

1057
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:52,609
looking at the calendar as much as I

1058
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:56,380
usually do definitely works for seed

1059
00:45:52,608 --> 00:45:59,659
starting I've found out like I planted

1060
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,338
one of my gardens I have two 5000 square

1061
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:03,048
foot gardens and one of them I planted

1062
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:05,509
on a root day and one of them I planted

1063
00:46:03,048 --> 00:46:08,358
on a flower day and the ones that I

1064
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:10,759
planted on a flower day were just

1065
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:13,938
started to shoot up really quick and had

1066
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:15,498
no you know they were just sitting there

1067
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,759
for a month where the other garden was

1068
00:46:15,498 --> 00:46:19,698
actually sitting there for a whole month

1069
00:46:16,759 --> 00:46:21,679
before they even like started growing so

1070
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:24,679
so and the whole garden that whole

1071
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:27,619
garden was like predominantly larger

1072
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:29,959
than the other one the biodynamic

1073
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:32,838
calendar it looks at different astrology

1074
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:35,838
and the sign so a flower is your is your

1075
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:38,659
air signs your your Gemini and your

1076
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:41,298
Libra and Aquarius and so anyway that's

1077
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:43,130
just part of the idea is the pushing and

1078
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:46,489
pulling forces too that are happening

1079
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:48,439
that at a certain moment like a certain

1080
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:50,239
variety that's going to have be grown

1081
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:52,338
for roots or being grown for a green

1082
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:55,068
leaf to eat or for a flower at the end

1083
00:46:52,338 --> 00:46:57,288
that the pushing and pulling forces that

1084
00:46:55,068 --> 00:46:59,688
are happening all the time you know I

1085
00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:01,899
mean we have our tides and everything

1086
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:04,368
there's all these things that are

1087
00:47:01,898 --> 00:47:06,798
affected by these pushes and poles but

1088
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:09,588
to pay attention to you know what the

1089
00:47:06,798 --> 00:47:11,449
seeds do Maria tune did a lot of work on

1090
00:47:09,588 --> 00:47:12,619
paying attention to radishes and

1091
00:47:11,449 --> 00:47:14,269
documenting it and just showing that

1092
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:16,759
certain days you just get a completely

1093
00:47:14,268 --> 00:47:18,798
different production so it's as good to

1094
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:20,329
observe you know the different days that

1095
00:47:18,798 --> 00:47:21,768
you crack something and write that down

1096
00:47:20,329 --> 00:47:23,839
and see what you know you can learn from

1097
00:47:21,768 --> 00:47:25,338
it and look what other people have

1098
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,288
learned from the biodynamic calendar

1099
00:47:25,338 --> 00:47:29,088
yeah and it can give you a real basic

1100
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:31,999
sense of just like how to stay in tune

1101
00:47:29,088 --> 00:47:34,099
with the moon you know so you might make

1102
00:47:31,998 --> 00:47:36,558
practices that aren't maybe following

1103
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:37,068
the exact calendar but you're at least

1104
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,798
in

1105
00:47:37,068 --> 00:47:41,748
tune with how the calendar functions off

1106
00:47:39,798 --> 00:47:45,349
of moon cycles so understanding the

1107
00:47:41,748 --> 00:47:47,988
greater cosmic cycles gives you a chance

1108
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:50,419
to not need to write everything down

1109
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:53,208
because your calendar is working with

1110
00:47:50,418 --> 00:47:55,368
the calendar of nature so the moon is

1111
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:57,168
growing I'm planting seeds the moon is

1112
00:47:55,369 --> 00:48:00,108
waning I'm not planting seeds and I'm

1113
00:47:57,168 --> 00:48:01,509
harvesting those are like real general

1114
00:48:00,108 --> 00:48:04,639
terms that aren't super specific

1115
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:07,458
biodynamic but come from that mentality

1116
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:13,778
around how to do things are there any

1117
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:13,778
more questions here yeah

1118
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:26,800
okay the the question that she asked was

1119
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:32,110
about the creation of seed banks it's

1120
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:36,400
happening anytime you make seeds you're

1121
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:38,970
making a seed bank I'm a big advocate of

1122
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,220
everybody making their seed banks and

1123
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:46,659
the actual business of seed banks I

1124
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:48,609
think needs to be you know yeah like a

1125
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:51,389
genetic preservation where you can

1126
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:53,559
access open source that is happening

1127
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:56,170
yeah you have to look into it there's

1128
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:59,980
definitely people around with those

1129
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:01,389
ideas and and it's an interesting one

1130
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:04,570
you know I just say keep your eyes real

1131
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:06,819
open on what it's all coming from but I

1132
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,350
would say that the farming community

1133
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,580
like this regenerative community like a

1134
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:11,529
lot of the people that you've seen here

1135
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:14,500
through the weekend like that is a seed

1136
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:16,390
bank like Nick was like breeding storing

1137
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,650
seeds restoring a sea bank and these are

1138
00:49:16,389 --> 00:49:19,210
people that are sharing with each other

1139
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,680
and creating stuff into the generations

1140
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:23,860
and now it's in multiple different

1141
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:25,929
places instead of just one and all of us

1142
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:28,360
have some of our genetics in each

1143
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:30,039
other's library and you know just

1144
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,230
keeping growing like that I think is the

1145
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:33,730
way to get through it because stuff like

1146
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,679
that can get kind of messy sometimes

1147
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,539
there's a lot of bureaucracy and sharks

1148
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:39,369
and strangeness but I think the really

1149
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:43,679
just keeping a community is a really

1150
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:45,609
great way to preserve genetics and seeds

1151
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:48,099
so yeah I just want to share a story

1152
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:51,460
from our farm this spring and summer we

1153
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:54,119
did for the first time at scale of open

1154
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:57,490
pollination auto flower seed garden and

1155
00:49:54,119 --> 00:50:00,099
the honeybees just went wild for the

1156
00:49:57,489 --> 00:50:02,139
male pollen and it was and their

1157
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:05,139
population was stronger all summer and

1158
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:07,029
it was just so much fun to witness that

1159
00:50:05,139 --> 00:50:08,710
happening I mean we have we have a lot

1160
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,890
of flowers just you know we're dragonfly

1161
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:14,740
earth medicine but the they the cannabis

1162
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:16,659
pollen they were swarming for it and and

1163
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:18,849
also like in my neighborhood no one does

1164
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:21,339
early summer depths so I didn't have to

1165
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:23,019
worry about you know messing anybody's

1166
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:27,280
stuff up but it was really beautiful to

1167
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:29,079
see that a lot of times people ask like

1168
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,269
oh is the honey better from pollen from

1169
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:33,159
you know cannabis the flower but it's

1170
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:35,619
the nectar that goes into the

1171
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:37,929
but but the pollen is a great source we

1172
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:40,450
just had Aidan with do the regeneration

1173
00:50:37,929 --> 00:50:42,578
of the honeybee and talking about the

1174
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:44,500
qualities of pollen and like you know

1175
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:46,298
it's over 50 percent protein and it

1176
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,920
energizes you it's a food source and you

1177
00:50:46,298 --> 00:50:49,568
can collect it off bees in the hives

1178
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,519
when they like go into the hive and

1179
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:53,409
knock it off but be kind of curious to

1180
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,280
eat some cannabis pollen though well

1181
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:59,940
yeah I actually sent some to the company

1182
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,809
down to LA I've met him he does like the

1183
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,250
another things that's like floor

1184
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:05,589
wellness they do like the cannabis

1185
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,630
aphrodisiac oil and he wanted research

1186
00:51:05,588 --> 00:51:09,699
for pollen for you know like a male

1187
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:11,740
supplement you know piling pine pollens

1188
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:13,298
like what a natural male just Ostrom

1189
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:14,709
booster and yeah so I think we'll

1190
00:51:13,298 --> 00:51:19,900
probably see cannabis pollen as a

1191
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:23,190
superfood and in the future a question

1192
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:25,720
yeah I just wanted to comment too on

1193
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:28,960
something we recently learned together

1194
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:30,969
is one where preserving seeds to not

1195
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,579
just preserve the seeds but also maybe

1196
00:51:30,969 --> 00:51:36,038
just like you press a flower preserve

1197
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:38,230
the flower because that when you are

1198
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:40,390
thinking of starting a seed bank if you

1199
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:42,670
go to different types of seed banks

1200
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:45,250
they're gonna have a sample of the

1201
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:47,829
actual flower that is so you can see the

1202
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:51,309
qualities for yourself so there is ways

1203
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:54,818
to press an ugh yes so herbariums are a

1204
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:57,579
basis for botany to understand a plant

1205
00:51:54,818 --> 00:51:58,989
and to know like its morphology and

1206
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:00,700
you're actually preserving the genetics

1207
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:04,118
so it's just making a pressing on

1208
00:52:00,699 --> 00:52:06,759
quality paper keeping it dry and put

1209
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:09,490
some weight or pressure onto it and

1210
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,099
those get stored in an herbarium so it's

1211
00:52:09,489 --> 00:52:15,009
like a resource but that is a great way

1212
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:16,359
to kind of preserve the information from

1213
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:19,809
something that you're working on

1214
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:22,108
Canadore is here and they that's

1215
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:27,400
something that they work on as well as

1216
00:52:22,108 --> 00:52:30,639
genetics yeah and then also you could

1217
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,680
store just making some hash from that in

1218
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:35,288
the hash will store for quite some time

1219
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:38,469
and you can go back and reflect on those

1220
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:42,660
flavor profiles later do have any more

1221
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:42,659
questions yep in the back

1222
00:52:55,909 --> 00:53:05,539
ai-ya-ya so he's asking about full

1223
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:08,789
yes he's talking about the value of

1224
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:11,460
making your seeds outdoors with one crop

1225
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:13,980
under the natural cycles look for it

1226
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,630
from your breeder if they're doing that

1227
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,519
they should be letting you know because

1228
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:19,950
that's the nuance and difference that we

1229
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:23,099
need so I don't know how many people are

1230
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:25,439
doing it in that strict of a methodology

1231
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:28,469
but I am and that's green source garden

1232
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,510
so it's you know I try to make available

1233
00:53:28,469 --> 00:53:32,449
and I think it's everybody every farms

1234
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:35,580
responsibility to make available

1235
00:53:32,449 --> 00:53:38,879
literature trail or information that

1236
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:40,889
helps you understand the ethos of that

1237
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,840
farm so you can resonate with something

1238
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:45,929
that you believe in and kind of follow

1239
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,820
that so as farms producing and in the in

1240
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:49,980
the market we got to do the best we can

1241
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:51,720
to be mission driven and ethically

1242
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,510
forward and transparent about our

1243
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:56,609
practices and that way you get what you

1244
00:53:54,510 --> 00:54:00,210
read on the package and not just a bunch

1245
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:02,730
of corporate bullshit do daniel or

1246
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:05,970
forest do you use mix light at all in

1247
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:09,030
your genetics program no but with

1248
00:54:05,969 --> 00:54:12,329
ruderalis I did something first for the

1249
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:15,330
first time this year I made an f1 and

1250
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:20,069
then the F 2 in the same summer which

1251
00:54:15,329 --> 00:54:22,889
was fun and and we're also in a little

1252
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:25,860
bit of a banana belt there last December

1253
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:28,049
I harvested Panama red seeds on the 15th

1254
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:33,380
and some other land race stuff in a

1255
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:37,519
greenhouse you know but no no mix light

1256
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:39,990
yeah we don't use any mix light either I

1257
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:44,039
feel like it's really important for all

1258
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:48,509
of us to if we can breed do it make more

1259
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:51,300
seed share the seed and you know I do in

1260
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:53,370
my in my home grow I do a mixed light

1261
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,570
cuz I get excited about my new cross and

1262
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:55,259
then I want to plant the seeds right

1263
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,370
away so

1264
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,710
I'm gonna go home from the Emerald cup

1265
00:54:56,369 --> 00:55:00,480
and plant my seeds and start funeral

1266
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:03,599
hunting and maybe I'll get some cuttings

1267
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:06,000
for the for the next season but yeah I I

1268
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,579
will kind of just cuz I want to see what

1269
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,199
what the different just what the

1270
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:12,389
expression is and I can only do a few

1271
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:14,069
it's very limited in space but it's fun

1272
00:55:12,389 --> 00:55:17,460
you should tell us a little bit about

1273
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:20,430
your cultivation practices and she'd dry

1274
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:23,159
farms and tell a little bit of it yeah I

1275
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:25,169
dry farm I kind of have this philosophy

1276
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:27,149
of do-nothing farming and do-nothing

1277
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:31,380
farm is really based on looking at

1278
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:33,090
nature to guide me in in what I do and I

1279
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:37,829
don't want to say I'm lazy but maybe

1280
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:42,750
that's a part of it too but I do I also

1281
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:46,440
do a few I make some crosses and yeah I

1282
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:48,599
have a home grow where I explore some

1283
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,340
it's like my research garden and so I'll

1284
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:52,230
do a few things in there and I'll do

1285
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,430
some some winter gardening and it's also

1286
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:57,809
temper aside on't have to worry about

1287
00:55:53,429 --> 00:56:00,690
heat and whatnot I just but yeah so

1288
00:55:57,809 --> 00:56:03,119
that's just I I've been seeing over time

1289
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:05,039
that some some things do better with the

1290
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,199
dry farming when well when you first

1291
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:11,400
plant there's some things that will take

1292
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:15,149
better and I also I don't use like

1293
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:17,550
greenhouses I just put the plants under

1294
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:21,059
the sky and the stars in the rain and

1295
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:22,980
and in the nursery phase and I feel that

1296
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:24,150
that helps them because they're right

1297
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,469
next to the garden because the

1298
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:27,210
greenhouse adds a lot of different

1299
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:28,469
stressors and different things and they

1300
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:31,590
start needing more nutrients and so

1301
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:31,949
without that it just seemed to grow grow

1302
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:34,019
better

1303
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:38,250
but yeah I'm located on the in the L

1304
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:40,349
River Valley in across from from Shively

1305
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:43,920
where there's some amazing dry farmers

1306
00:56:40,349 --> 00:56:46,650
over there and my friend Jane from

1307
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,930
organic medicinal she is the one who

1308
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:50,880
turned me on to dry farming and I just

1309
00:56:48,929 --> 00:56:52,469
thank her very much for it because it's

1310
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,289
through that that I really found myself

1311
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:58,468
as a farmer

1312
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:58,469
[Applause]

1313
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:05,759
and bill Reynolds - oh yeah bill bill

1314
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:07,798
Reynolds was a big I'm still I grow all

1315
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:09,960
of his veggies the darkstar zucchini and

1316
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:11,518
the melon and anyway but we're coming

1317
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,920
here to the end did you find any

1318
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:16,368
varieties that like do better in dry

1319
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:19,079
farming have you found

1320
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:24,180
yeah but they are everything takes

1321
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:26,460
pretty well a lot of it is just getting

1322
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:29,009
a natural expression of the land and

1323
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:31,710
just seeing what the genetics are with

1324
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:36,690
as little inputs and interference on my

1325
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:39,059
part all right well we're at the close

1326
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:44,039
here and is there any more closing

1327
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:48,809
remarks which you'd like to make some

1328
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:57,809
closing remarks just yeah more love more

1329
00:57:48,809 --> 00:58:01,369
seeds you know power to people yeah I

1330
00:57:57,809 --> 00:58:04,650
can't express enough like it really is

1331
00:58:01,369 --> 00:58:08,630
the most viable seed bank is with us all

1332
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:12,028
and so if we're connected to that source

1333
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:13,829
the future is looking good but if you're

1334
00:58:12,028 --> 00:58:17,639
disconnected from that and relying on

1335
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:20,880
other people to make all that it's an

1336
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:22,498
it's not a secure for you so you can go

1337
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,999
in this direction where it's like it

1338
00:58:22,498 --> 00:58:25,588
doesn't have to be a ton of seed and it

1339
00:58:23,998 --> 00:58:28,879
doesn't have to be cannabis it just

1340
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:31,440
needs to be this act of participating in

1341
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,099
humanity that's been doing this for so

1342
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,068
long

1343
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:38,369
so let's reconnect with our ancient

1344
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:43,949
selves and become close to this earth

1345
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:45,869
once again and take care of it yeah you

1346
00:58:43,949 --> 00:58:47,879
know they this really could be the

1347
00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:53,068
Garden of Eden let's think we have to

1348
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:56,249
clean it up first though yeah keep

1349
00:58:53,068 --> 00:58:59,670
making seed and keep sharing seed yeah

1350
00:58:56,248 --> 00:59:01,288
thank you and do things with love just

1351
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:03,119
do the things that you care about with

1352
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:05,219
love interact with your community with

1353
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,170
love breed with love put that into it

1354
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:09,659
you know like Luther Burbank is saying

1355
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,559
like it's powerful what what that can

1356
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:12,779
lead to

1357
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:15,690
it's it's like it's like connection of

1358
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:18,450
of love that it's it's the guidance of

1359
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:20,639
nature and our in our connection with

1360
00:59:18,449 --> 00:59:23,439
love that makes this beautiful nature

1361
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:34,319
that we're learning from everyday

1362
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:34,320
[Applause]
