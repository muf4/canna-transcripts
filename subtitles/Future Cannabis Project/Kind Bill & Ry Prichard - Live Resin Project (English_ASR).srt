[Music]

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:10,489
well I'm ripe Richard a lot of people

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,960
know me from the TV show Bon Appetit and

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,240
we're you know I'm a real live resin

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,618
enthusiast and we're trying to you know

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,179
bring the product that we really believe

7
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:20,250
in that we think expresses cannabis to

8
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,089
the highest level to as many people as

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,379
we possibly can

10
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:25,768
so they can have that awesome experience

11
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:28,919
and I'm kind bill and I'm known for

12
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:30,868
bringing live resin to the market being

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,380
the innovator behind the product and

14
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:38,969
yeah we this group of guys behind

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,309
libraries and project had had been with

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,100
this this particular product since the

17
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:47,640
impetus and we've finally been able to

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,410
band together under a unified brand and

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:01:01,049
bring the product to the to the market

20
00:00:49,409 --> 00:01:03,839
so so we're we just launched in

21
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:06,090
California so we're available in in in

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,710
stores right now are our distributions

23
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,540
increasing over time

24
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,368
we're you know in terms of scale where

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,159
we're trying to focus on delivering the

26
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,049
absolute highest quality so while we

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,490
think we can scale up quality to a large

28
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,500
degree we're always going to be mindful

29
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,269
of that and trying to you know keep it

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,969
as as boutique is possible and working

31
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:26,099
with cultivators that really do

32
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,810
high-level work so that we can respect

33
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:32,219
that work and deliver a great final

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,859
product exactly like the reason that we

35
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,140
chose California as the place to launch

36
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:40,200
this is the availability of quality

37
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,728
quality start material right and so we

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,399
thought we could come out here and

39
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:47,188
really highlight the work that these

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,590
legacy farmers have been putting out and

41
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:52,639
and also you know what's important to me

42
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:56,100
and always has been is like access both

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,250
patient access and for me farmer access

44
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:01,799
to to regulation right

45
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,739
so can you talk a little bit about your

46
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,599
manufacturing process and how you're

47
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:10,250
utilizing the pulse evaders yes yeah go

48
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,379
ahead go ahead

49
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,210
uh-huh so I mean we we try to work

50
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,590
really closely with cultivators because

51
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,450
one of the things that we've noticed in

52
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,759
our time since you know starting this

53
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:24,569
process and doing this for you know of

54
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,129
quite a long time since 2013 the you

55
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,349
know the the handling process of the

56
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:29,430
material is super super important and so

57
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,079
one of the things we're trying to work

58
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,090
on is to develop relationships with

59
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,920
cultivators so that we can really help

60
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,240
them the entire way through I mean

61
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,309
honestly from the growing and everything

62
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,110
else even before that but from the point

63
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,449
of harvest there's so many things that

64
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,030
can go wrong with live resin just like

65
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:46,769
with live with dried product and so

66
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,360
that's been our focus largely it's

67
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,770
finding a really good partners to work

68
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,170
with and then be those that can be

69
00:02:49,770 --> 00:03:04,200
coached into delivering exactly what

70
00:02:52,169 --> 00:03:08,459
we're looking for using your traditional

71
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:11,399
process can you talk about those yeah so

72
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,400
one thing that we won't do is waver from

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,800
how we we do this until we find a better

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,810
way right so we're oh we're always

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,000
measuring measuring measuring and

76
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:26,099
looking to improve but we don't go okay

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,860
now the scale is this we can take this

78
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,389
step out and that's just not and that's

79
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,049
why we won't really talk about scale

80
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:37,349
because work will back into demand

81
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:40,469
correct as we're able to fulfill it

82
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:46,169
uncompromised but we're still very hyper

83
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:48,209
focused on a fast harvest meticulously

84
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:53,099
handling material getting it cold very

85
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:54,870
quickly and and having we have a process

86
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,389
where we bring the temperature down over

87
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,480
time rather than get immediately frozen

88
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:03,719
unless a facility is equipped with the

89
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,099
technology and they're there now that

90
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,019
there are now facilities that have

91
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,908
cryogenic tunnels that can freeze this

92
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:13,099
stuff instantly and make it easy

93
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:16,038
so is that an expensive process that's

94
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:17,959
expensive so it's so like larger forms

95
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:19,969
been afford to do that yeah we're seeing

96
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,069
these in the large light debt greenhouse

97
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,600
operations yeah a lot of the Central

98
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,978
Valley places that have you know

99
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,840
hundreds of thousands of square feet of

100
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:28,310
greenhouse there they're devoting you

101
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,019
know quarters or half of that

102
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,689
specifically to live resin production so

103
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:34,639
they have to have cryo tunnels yeah yeah

104
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,680
there's a lot of partners that we're

105
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,650
working with I mean we you know some are

106
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,598
smaller indoor cultivators and some are

107
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:43,399
you know larger scale mix mix like

108
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:45,439
greenhouse or pure outdoor so you're

109
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:50,538
pitting at diversity of genetics as well

110
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:53,689
right yeah so not you know what gets me

111
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:57,348
excited right we we want to the goal

112
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:59,389
here is to have a few things that you

113
00:04:57,348 --> 00:05:01,399
can count on from us all the time we're

114
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,620
gonna always bring an OG we're gonna

115
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,989
always bring something in the orange

116
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,660
spectrum you know we're gonna have a

117
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,639
jack thing but we're also very excited

118
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,479
to see things that you might only see

119
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,069
once or that maybe this guy's we find

120
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,379
somebody that's been growing a plant for

121
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:21,228
twenty years and that's all they do and

122
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:23,000
that's really and that's a special

123
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:27,050
California thing too a lot of the time

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,680
yeah we can find somebody has dedicated

125
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,418
their career to one cultivar and then we

126
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,750
put it in this format and open it up to

127
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:37,399
a new you know user experience yeah I

128
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,810
mean I think part of you know to speak

129
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,089
to Bill's point earlier about just why

130
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,680
California I mean the the diversity of

131
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:44,359
what's out here and the legacy and the

132
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,889
history and the terroir and everything

133
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,098
that you can speak about is at such a

134
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:50,509
high level here that you know that

135
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,430
that's really what the live resin

136
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:54,019
process is for is capturing this

137
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,668
uniqueness and expressing it and

138
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:59,000
preserving it over time I mean being

139
00:05:55,668 --> 00:06:00,829
able to like a vintner or you know have

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,879
something that was really special that

141
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:03,918
will never be seen again in the history

142
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:06,500
of the world and to be able to kind of

143
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,879
save it over time and savor it and I

144
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,348
mean it's a really special thing so I

145
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,639
think that's that's what we're trying to

146
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:12,819
create is something that has that level

147
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,819
of

148
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,400
was like oh like an exceptional year so

149
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,669
we've been talking about this for years

150
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:28,929
and and yeah we're gonna see that we're

151
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:32,410
we're gonna see that you know the Sour

152
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,769
Diesel deep chunk off of that hill in in

153
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,689
you know 2019 was the best year that

154
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:42,009
that we had the right rain and we had

155
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:43,329
the right everything for that and you

156
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:44,980
know the califor

157
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:46,659
sunshine does some special things of

158
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,450
these plants when given the chance so

159
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:53,530
and we're excited it sounds like this is

160
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:56,409
a for people with a tightly special

161
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:58,359
appreciation page but are you going for

162
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,300
the masses like what like this forever

163
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,370
offenses yeah yes so what we found the

164
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,490
coolest thing about live resin right is

165
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,829
a it's like the champagne of the

166
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,990
cannabis world in one way and that it's

167
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:14,069
like it takes this to its ultimate form

168
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,930
I'm into Japanese materialism right so

169
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:20,980
everything has its ultimate expression

170
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:24,509
and perfect form and for me my present

171
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:27,430
is that for the cannabis plant and

172
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:30,579
what's different about it then champagne

173
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,439
or a Bordeaux is it super accessible

174
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:35,019
this stuff tastes so good you don't have

175
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,120
to be a connoisseur to be like wow that

176
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:39,039
made my mouth feel insane and now

177
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,629
there's like skittle little things

178
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,500
floating around in there and I don't you

179
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:46,600
know it doesn't take a weed snob to know

180
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,689
that this is a good thing and our

181
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:53,890
favorite thing is the first time user

182
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:55,719
that has no cannabis context to see

183
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,479
their face when they tried live resin

184
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,450
it's you know a totally opens them up

185
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,490
and and it's a great way to drop some of

186
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:06,339
the statements that come around our

187
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,470
products and plant it's just a lot more

188
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:10,239
interesting and diverse than then ah

189
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,370
then people are given on the surface for

190
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,769
hash going oh yeah yeah and I think like

191
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,319
the the focus on flavor and and that and

192
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:19,620
aroma and that part of live resin is so

193
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,909
important and I think it's you know two

194
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,069
bills credit it's very forward-thinking

195
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,229
and and it's something that you know

196
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:27,099
doing doing the show a bong Appetit and

197
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,538
things like that

198
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,409
that was something that I really tried

199
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:32,828
to emphasize because

200
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:34,778
the ability you know or the moment when

201
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:36,399
a chef like smells these things for the

202
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:37,750
first time it's it's really mind-blowing

203
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,370
for them and I and it's the same with

204
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,019
beverage the same it's perfume same with

205
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,479
any of these other industries and so

206
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:45,578
it's really you know the diversity of

207
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,209
the cannabis plant cannot be overstated

208
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:50,078
and it's gonna blow people's minds

209
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,969
throughout all these different

210
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:54,698
industries to see how this thing can do

211
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,459
and and as an industry we've taken such

212
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:58,958
care for this plant because of the high

213
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,849
value because of the illegality because

214
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,188
of all these things that we simply do it

215
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,269
at a higher level than beverage people

216
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:05,409
then a lot of these other people cuz

217
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:07,419
they they haven't been taking the risk

218
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:10,240
that somebody like Bill has for you know

219
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:11,979
being a cultivator since 1987 uh-huh

220
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,419
you know that that's not some real stuff

221
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:18,938
you know super interesting there really

222
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:21,188
is a lot of innovation right I mean and

223
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:22,629
there's a lot of young people too that

224
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:24,610
are working this

225
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:27,669
aren't there who are like creating these

226
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:31,870
sauces and new things I mean it's an

227
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:34,599
exciting innovative space it really is I

228
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,389
think and I'm into saving this now for

229
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,290
like five or six years maybe even eight

230
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:44,409
I feel like still cannabis industry it's

231
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:47,409
akin to like Silicon Valley like 1979

232
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:49,299
early early and just like there's some

233
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:52,088
people really on fire and there's a lot

234
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:53,399
going on but we don't even know how big

235
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:56,470
it's gonna be

236
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,980
no one knows no one knows how much this

237
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,740
is really gonna affect society at large

238
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:06,810
you five years ago already am a thick of

239
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:09,339
things in Colorado if you asked me that

240
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:11,318
I would be in the situation that I'm in

241
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:13,029
and have the you know answer to the

242
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:15,088
board of directors that I answer to and

243
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:17,948
things like that I would say you're

244
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:21,100
dreaming and in the most fantastic way

245
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:24,068
but dreaming and and here we are so it's

246
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:27,129
a it's an incredible voyage but now this

247
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:30,188
conversation is leading us in naturally

248
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:32,528
to the method of consumption of these

249
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:33,370
products which is also an innovative

250
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:36,439
area

251
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,210
devices so you know because

252
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,550
traditionally it was kind of difficult

253
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,740
you know it was an expert and a little

254
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:45,379
skill and not only did you consume it

255
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,690
properly but that's not a mass appeal

256
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,639
you know activities so what are we

257
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,700
seeing in that area it's gonna really

258
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:55,519
open that's so exciting but the device

259
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,770
manufacturers are really coming quickly

260
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,500
with better and better things and then

261
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:05,329
some of the larger producers are leaning

262
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:08,960
on them for device like it's significant

263
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:12,620
a little back story so I've been making

264
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,650
hash since the late 80s at a high

265
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:18,830
quality level but I didn't decide that

266
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:21,559
and I loved hash in all its forms but I

267
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:24,379
didn't go oh this is the format that I'm

268
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:26,179
going forward with until the nail came

269
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:29,689
because there was now a good way to

270
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:32,719
smoke it that changed my life first a

271
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,940
bond a nail I was like okay now there's

272
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,500
a good way to do this I'm gonna focus in

273
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,440
and then the next thing that happened

274
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,269
was the whipped texture came and now the

275
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,570
stuff wasn't so messy because

276
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:47,149
traditional hash oil and a little 15

277
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,310
years ago was uh was a hot mess and you

278
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:51,230
know when I was 18 I had my best

279
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,449
friend's mom hand me a jar of hash and

280
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,159
she was like I know you gave this to him

281
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,220
and he's destroying my house with it

282
00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:01,250
take it back

283
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:04,220
so device has always been the thing that

284
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,049
opened the next segment up and it

285
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,090
happened with the nail and it happened

286
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:11,839
with the pan it happened with the cart

287
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:14,720
and now we're going back to some cooler

288
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,950
more partible portable water filter

289
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,269
devices and I think that that's

290
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,270
important from a health standpoint

291
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:34,500
what is the what is the best experiment

292
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:37,829
so I get the best experience on a piece

293
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,159
of glass filtered through water and and

294
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:43,290
and simply because I have control of

295
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,730
that whole experience I have controlled

296
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:47,610
the amount of water I have controlled

297
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:52,379
the temperature of both water and the

298
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:55,500
glass and the it's easy to clean and

299
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:57,840
that's for me I'm very comfortable with

300
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,000
all of those things but I come from like

301
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:04,290
a glassblowing background and so a torch

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,700
isn't a foreign thing to me the torch is

303
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:09,179
prohibited though obviously for no

304
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,860
people for new people right so some

305
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,419
people may get their best experience

306
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:22,980
hitting a pen because they don't have

307
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:25,740
any baggage to go through yeah

308
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,379
so I mean we have all the textures like

309
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,659
you know butter shattered crystally and

310
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:35,509
all the things that people make but are

311
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:35,509
my favorites butter but we also have yes

312
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:42,269
yeah we're we're leading with butter and

313
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,680
cuz and we're gonna make more butter

314
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:45,299
than any of those other things because

315
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,979
that's what we really like and we think

316
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,049
that it's the best user experience and

317
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,940
again for more of an intro consumer

318
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:52,289
they're able to utilize that product

319
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,700
easier there's less mess it doesn't

320
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,199
slide off your dabber you get it all

321
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,430
there's there's a lot of reason you get

322
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,800
a consistent experience every time

323
00:13:56,429 --> 00:14:01,229
you're not getting a big rock or just

324
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,539
terpene sauce or whatever so I think you

325
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,759
know we're leading with that but our

326
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:08,039
live resin pan is really special we

327
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,159
think because we you know we do a

328
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:12,209
process that does zero separation zero

329
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,709
distillate

330
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,060
it's a categorically different thing

331
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,250
than most of what's on the market and

332
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:18,929
you know my favorite thing in the

333
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,080
morning is to have a coffee and to sip

334
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:23,519
on my Skywalker og pen because it's such

335
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,259
a wonderful pairing and it hits that

336
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,899
note because I'm high all day right like

337
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:30,210
I smoked all day and so all I'm looking

338
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,009
for is flavor flavor flavor flavor so

339
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,259
having you know if I had five different

340
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:34,710
flavors as bill mentioned if I can like

341
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:36,269
Oh

342
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,769
I want some haze with this I want to

343
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:42,149
moji with this like that's powerful to

344
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:43,500
me I mean we're gonna have some some you

345
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,360
know recurring kind of hitters that we

346
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,769
want to keep in the stable like the

347
00:14:45,360 --> 00:15:03,629
Skywalker og I think we're gonna have

348
00:14:46,769 --> 00:15:05,460
that pretty regular yeah so we are

349
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:08,879
thinking about those things but I'm

350
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,800
hyper focused on fresh shuttin available

351
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,419
right so what's good right now what can

352
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,899
we get that's the best thing right now

353
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:19,019
and there's a value piece to like what

354
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:22,679
are we going to be able to give at the

355
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:28,470
best value for for the quality so we're

356
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:31,769
we're hypersensitive about right yeah

357
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,779
yeah right so because we found great

358
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:36,029
partners that have large quantities of

359
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:38,189
some of some things that are exceptional

360
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:40,470
that we can get at a value price we can

361
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:44,520
afford to buy some crazy expensive

362
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:47,550
things that are rare and one price at

363
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,559
all which is cool you know and we would

364
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:53,879
like people to only pay one thing but

365
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:56,279
give them a very degree of rarity and

366
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:58,019
and complexity yeah and I think you know

367
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,029
in general the raw concentrates will be

368
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,370
more leaning into the variability and

369
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:04,289
the small-batch aspect of things whereas

370
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,060
like you know the the pen where we're

371
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:07,349
looking to hit you know maybe slightly

372
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,479
larger distribution numbers with that

373
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,610
product and and you know as you

374
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,560
mentioned like it's less form factor

375
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,300
inhibitive so more people will access

376
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,279
that product than whatever body rock

377
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,479
concentrates so you know we're trying to

378
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,539
give people an authentic rock

379
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,730
concentrate experience in an easy format

380
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:26,779
and and I think I think that it'll it'll

381
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,779
do pretty well you know

382
00:16:42,159 --> 00:17:13,480
but you're also man

383
00:16:44,950 --> 00:17:16,660
I mean I feel like the markets got a lot

384
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,279
of room in it yeah honestly there's no

385
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,160
pie for everybody out here people who

386
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:22,779
love weed in California right so we love

387
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,380
California weed everywhere once that

388
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:28,299
happens all right so I try not to get

389
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,090
hemmed up on that stuff I always go back

390
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,950
to like what's the best thing okay we're

391
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:35,879
gonna make the best thing we're gonna

392
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,740
tell people that we have it and my

393
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,260
career's history shows that that's the

394
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:44,109
end of it you make the best thing that

395
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:45,579
you can you put out a product that you

396
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:47,229
can truly be passionate and believe in

397
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:49,329
like you see I'm excited about this

398
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,180
stuff I believe in it I've never sold

399
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:54,279
anything that I wouldn't buy and that

400
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,440
carries true right into the market and

401
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,059
that all takes care of itself then if

402
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,850
you stay true to what brought you here

403
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:03,819
and and we we've gone on a long road

404
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:05,829
right yeah we just keep giving the best

405
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:07,839
thing that we're able and make it

406
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:09,189
accessible yeah you you you you respect

407
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,019
the plan you respect the work of the

408
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,850
people that grow the plant you you honor

409
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:14,950
those relationships you honor what this

410
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:16,899
plant does for the world and how it can

411
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:21,410
change things and you just think about

412
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:25,220
that at every step so that sounds great

413
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:32,930
no you guys need and it's true but

414
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:34,910
you're also in a reality out there so

415
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:39,410
there's all of these people in between

416
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:43,990
you and and your PC you know who were

417
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,990
handling the product marketing selling

418
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,850
you know

419
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:58,010
that they're in control you know as much

420
00:18:52,849 --> 00:19:02,469
as they are really important to because

421
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:07,069
people are you know touching your brain

422
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:08,900
so you know yeah obviously we're looking

423
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:12,529
for the right partners on the retail

424
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:16,220
side 100% and and we're looking for

425
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:18,288
people that can get excited you know one

426
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,298
of Rhys very strong suits is actually

427
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:22,970
like budtender education and

428
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:25,940
point-of-sale interaction and we provide

429
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,769
all of that type of support and so when

430
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,200
we get into a store we're not gonna just

431
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:31,849
drop product to the store we're gonna

432
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,940
interact with their bud tenders on a

433
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:37,788
high level and get them excited about it

434
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,830
that's who sells this product marketing

435
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:43,548
doesn't like gets it out there but who

436
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:48,349
sells weed our bad bud tenders and if

437
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:52,700
they like your product and you are easy

438
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:55,969
to deal with that part is it is you know

439
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,788
and we hyper focus on that on the people

440
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,529
that have the customer facing 100%

441
00:19:58,788 --> 00:20:03,379
taking care of them and making sure they

442
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:05,119
are educated and well supportive and and

443
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,590
people I think I think customers and

444
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,719
people working within the industry

445
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:10,849
largely because a lot of them are new to

446
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,250
the industry are starving for education

447
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:15,798
it's it's it's something that the

448
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,690
importance cannot be overstated of of

449
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:19,759
like getting people grounded in what

450
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,288
cannabis is how it works why things are

451
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,740
good why things are different and and

452
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:26,569
it's it's a really it's a you know

453
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,250
seeing this happen all across the

454
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:30,109
country and all across the world now and

455
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,960
seeing and seeing the exponential growth

456
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:35,149
of it it also needs exponential growth

457
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,620
of Education and support and and real

458
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,910
support and not wool pulling because

459
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:40,649
there's a lot of that too

460
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,600
you know you both in your own way or

461
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,210
educate you know and have experience

462
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,589
doing that what were you gonna be doing

463
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,539
I talked a little bit about what your

464
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:53,519
roles are and what where you where you

465
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:55,680
see your energies going so I mean I I

466
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:59,579
think that I'm you know I've been doing

467
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,660
a lot of like product work recently and

468
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:02,579
you know trying to like get these things

469
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,200
out to market but I think I'm gonna be

470
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:06,599
transitioning more into like content

471
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,660
creation because again I I think the

472
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,609
importance of education is is real and

473
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,259
making education palatable so that

474
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:15,149
people don't even necessarily have to

475
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:16,950
seek it out where they get educated via

476
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,580
entertainment via things like bong

477
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,289
Appetit

478
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:20,819
I think I think there's an importance

479
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,710
there and so what I want to do is is

480
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:24,059
focus on that bring bring high

481
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,829
functioning people in from other

482
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,109
industries to increase their

483
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:29,460
understanding of cannabis and to you

484
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:30,959
know get to the point where we can truly

485
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,460
truly collaborate because what's

486
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,900
happening now is people are coming from

487
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,610
those industries into the cannabis

488
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,920
industry but then there's still kind of

489
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:39,919
a fence in between for no good reason

490
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:48,660
actually been out for quite a while so

491
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,629
you talked about like product

492
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:54,240
development so easier so is live resin

493
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:57,000
like the foundation of frog this is like

494
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,099
our you know Jack Daniels you know it's

495
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,349
never been exchanged but we're but

496
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:03,839
there's the next generations of fraud

497
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:08,279
onset that were coming up with is that

498
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:14,069
what we're talking about here so within

499
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:15,599
this brand of live resin project I'd

500
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:18,079
like to think of this as like the

501
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:24,029
beginning of the champagne industry or

502
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:26,759
cognac cognac like we've found a very

503
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:29,250
specific way to honor all of the special

504
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:33,990
traits of this plant and I'd like to

505
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:36,210
really build on that tradition and turn

506
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:40,069
it into something that's an honored

507
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:43,590
process that can carry on and I'm not

508
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:44,939
closed at all to new different ways of

509
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:47,939
experiencing this plant

510
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,840
in this format we're gonna hone how we

511
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:55,080
harvest and we're gonna always be open

512
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:58,108
to new technologies but there are some

513
00:22:55,079 --> 00:23:01,319
core things about it that I'm unwilling

514
00:22:58,108 --> 00:23:05,519
to change and I would like that to be

515
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:06,898
kind of the center of this brand is is

516
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,479
that we're putting a stake in the ground

517
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:10,888
and saying that you know this is the

518
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:14,308
beginning of something that people are

519
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:17,158
gonna enjoy for hopefully generations

520
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:20,700
and eons and we want it to be honored in

521
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,979
the way that that craft things are you

522
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,749
know and and and like I said before I

523
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:33,840
think that this is the pinnacle of

524
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:35,788
expression for our plan yeah yeah yeah

525
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,048
so I mean I I think one of the things

526
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:38,489
that we're trying to be conscious of and

527
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,929
one of the the reasons that it's called

528
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:41,729
libraries and project actually is

529
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:45,359
because it's it's it's an ongoing

530
00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:47,249
process of figuring out you know how to

531
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:49,470
do the thing that we know how to do

532
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:51,479
incremental II better every day and then

533
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:54,389
also how to think about you know new

534
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:55,979
ways of modifying things to improve

535
00:23:54,388 --> 00:23:58,678
environmental conditions you know things

536
00:23:55,979 --> 00:24:00,359
like oxidation there's a lot of small

537
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,399
tweaks you can make and the storage of

538
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:03,569
the product the you know air exposures

539
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:05,428
throughout the entire process there's

540
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:07,319
there's a whole lot of headway that can

541
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:08,669
be made there that you know we're just

542
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:10,108
getting to the point now where we can

543
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:11,909
really start playing with that stuff

544
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:14,548
because we have a really sound base

545
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:16,649
after you know doing this since 2013

546
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:18,319
this particular process so they need

547
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:21,178
before that making hash and growing

548
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,408
cannabis and everything else I think we

549
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,869
you know we're now getting to the point

550
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:25,979
where you know technology coming from

551
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:28,199
other industries like micro

552
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:30,179
encapsulation and particle shearing and

553
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,369
all this stuff is going to have

554
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,619
applications with this but you know to

555
00:24:32,368 --> 00:24:36,628
Bill's point like the purity of what the

556
00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:39,509
library experience offers I don't think

557
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:40,888
will change all that much it will it

558
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:42,839
will it will improve and we'll figure

559
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:45,868
out better ways to deliver it to store

560
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:47,459
it to harvest all those things but the

561
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:49,978
core of it is so powerful because what

562
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,619
we're doing is very very high level

563
00:24:49,979 --> 00:24:54,058
essential oil extraction higher level

564
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:55,439
than the perfume industry is doing and

565
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:56,638
that and that's categorical we've heard

566
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,450
that from the highest levels in the

567
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:58,919
perfume industry

568
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:04,830
so we're based in Oakland

569
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:10,140
and you have a lab up in operating 5:7

570
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:18,899
type 7 getting a degree stuff that had a

571
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:22,140
shift so and and as you know you know we

572
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:25,230
have all the pertinent toys and proper

573
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,720
freezer storage and really good

574
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:30,599
relationships with manufacturers and as

575
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,940
to your earlier question there's an

576
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:36,689
education piece for me obviously and I

577
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:40,039
educate well market face but I actually

578
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:43,740
spend more of my education internally

579
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:45,680
investors all the people that just need

580
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,250
to understand this on a higher level

581
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:52,830
architects engineers whoever it is that

582
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:55,380
inspectors state regulators global fire

583
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:58,039
chief yeah whoever it is that we're

584
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:01,110
talking to him to make the thing happen

585
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:04,230
but then the one of the reasons that I

586
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:06,329
chose to go this route was was I really

587
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:12,000
want to put a lien on on on the

588
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:15,809
equipment side there isn't a machine for

589
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,210
making this library so it's an adapted

590
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:20,159
process on somebody's equipment and

591
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,559
there's where there's some leaps to be

592
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,200
made all the way small in a bunch of

593
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:30,049
little places to build the device that's

594
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,049
designed to make this happen

595
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:37,389
yeah yeah no it was a super manual

596
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,250
process and then he made it less manual

597
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,600
into Tony freezer AdBlue River is

598
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,119
they're doing the exact same thing and

599
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,379
and so there's there's a lot of I think

600
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,969
I think that's where you'll see the

601
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,470
innovation I completely agree with Bill

602
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,539
there is that you know the actual

603
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,100
process and the actual equipment at both

604
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:52,269
for consumption and for production I

605
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:57,519
think is where we're gonna see a lot of

606
00:26:52,269 --> 00:27:00,490
the the biggest shifts forward there's

607
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:03,009
gonna be more times fat in me or in

608
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,349
being equipment both running other

609
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:06,420
people's equipment and we're gonna build

610
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:09,490
a machine

611
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:12,490
honestly that like with my fabrication

612
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,170
background and all of this it only makes

613
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:23,170
sense that we make the machine that'll

614
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:26,820
do this correctly you will definitely

615
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:29,830
see me out promoting my resin project

616
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,359
yeah and you know I'll get you're gonna

617
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:34,058
see us on the East Coast soon enough

618
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:37,839
we're here in California but we're gonna

619
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:46,899
will pop up in Massachusetts hopefully

620
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:48,639
q1 yeah I mean you know there's there's

621
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,380
you know there's some states where

622
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,640
there's no solvent extraction and so

623
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,290
like we're just not really gonna play

624
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,570
there there's other states where there's

625
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:57,159
you know legacy markets where people

626
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:58,149
love hash where they're very familiar

627
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,250
with live president and they have

628
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,320
$10,000 rigs and everything else just

629
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,759
like California so we're we're super

630
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,829
excited about those markets and we think

631
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,650
that you know places like like Illinois

632
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:09,759
and you know Florida once they change

633
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:14,350
some of the regulations I mean it's

634
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:17,069
crazy yeah 100 percent 100 percent take

635
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:17,069
it home yeah

636
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,079
just thank you Tom it's always a

637
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,079
pleasure yeah
