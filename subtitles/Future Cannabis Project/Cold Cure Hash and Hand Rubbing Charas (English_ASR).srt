[Music]

2
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,439
not just whip tech it's just stirring

3
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:33,359
kids call it cold caring it's really

4
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,070
more of like a room temperature than a

5
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:42,840
cold care but uh you just wait for the

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:45,030
fresh press rosin to cure essentially it

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:50,250
goes through a marbling period and then

8
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,989
kind of all becomes the same yeah it

9
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,210
becomes the same opacity the same

10
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:55,948
consistency and then you just bust it up

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,660
and stir it and homogenize all the

12
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:03,390
terpenes in there that that kind of

13
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:07,308
break down the texture unicorn chili

14
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,308
right seriously the two colors right now

15
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:15,658
yeah even if the maybe less if the

16
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,340
products really good it almost happens

17
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,290
instantaneous I'd say a minute and a

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,840
half two minutes if there's a real

19
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,540
terpene rich product it'll get real wet

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,950
like that some of them just are dry or

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,080
resins and I'm not even saying it's a

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,759
worser thing to some resins are drier

23
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,129
than others some are wetter than others

24
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,629
this is a wetter resin so it you know

25
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,899
it's cold outside but it's still

26
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:37,890
puddling you know it looks like pudding

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,630
yeah it happens really quick

28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,759
instantaneous I've seen these little

29
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:45,140
drill bit attachments that kids

30
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,688
literally like do that

31
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,000
yeah I'm 100% to me it's not necessary

32
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:52,978
like it's not even necessarily stirring

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,140
and it's kind of like stab it up step it

34
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:59,908
up step it up you know I mean and it'll

35
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,950
continue to get even more viscous for

36
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,270
lack of a better word but you know this

37
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,380
is like that moment

38
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:07,849
kind of

39
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:09,019
if you're smoked fresh press that kind

40
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:12,919
of like goes through all these different

41
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,140
changes and this is like kind of almost

42
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,599
Russia's it to that moment it keeps it

43
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:21,199
at that state and I'll stay stable like

44
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:27,259
that just like that should stay like

45
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:29,629
that for months so again a dry one will

46
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:32,479
still do it for you I've seen some

47
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:35,299
people reintroduce more heat to make it

48
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:39,679
so that it does this better that's not

49
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:41,330
really necessarily what I'm after like I

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,890
said it's just another texture so some

51
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,390
of them will be drier and someone will

52
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:46,279
be wetter like this doesn't make it

53
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:50,149
better or worse now you know what I mean

54
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,430
it is what it is but no no what with

55
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,860
that fresh press just if you were like a

56
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,740
brand and you're trying to serve fresh

57
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,360
pressed rosin to a consumer not only do

58
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,100
you have to keep it cold but when you

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,360
transport it you have to keep it cold

60
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,009
and then you have to expect your

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,020
retailer to keep it cold for the

62
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,219
consumer you know what I'm saying and

63
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,209
they're supposed to be representing your

64
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:14,030
brand in such a way it it is 100% so

65
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:16,370
this is kind of one way to kind of be

66
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,989
like oh it'll look like this you know I

67
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,780
mean I know it will look like this and

68
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,340
you know three six months you know and I

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,560
mean like long enough will look just

70
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,450
like that yep as long as you do it right

71
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,770
and do it the right way and like as you

72
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:29,289
can see I was just stabbing on a second

73
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,370
oh it's already settling you know so

74
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:32,780
consumer got it would just be a flat

75
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,759
puddle on the bottom of your jar you

76
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,020
know what I mean no and again I don't

77
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,799
even make this stuff it's all Brannan's

78
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,750
to be honest I don't

79
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,370
yeah I just saw it was at the right

80
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,409
moment I'll think I'm gonna go show Josh

81
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,730
this cuz he'll appreciate it and I just

82
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:48,439
stirred it in front of him just to show

83
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:58,699
it my stuff's too fresh to even like be

84
00:03:48,439 --> 00:04:00,060
at this state yet but Brandon we wander

85
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:03,098
over there yeah we should

86
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,098
[Music]

87
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:25,620
he's all impressed no I just stirred it

88
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:27,509
for him I bet if he wants me to I can

89
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,340
probably do it with this jar too this is

90
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:39,560
what it started looking like so it

91
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:39,560
started so that's what it started

92
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:52,199
started like this and like again you

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,870
just bust it all up

94
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,000
homogenized it all and it'll get all wet

95
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:05,939
we'll see if we can bust up this one as

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:11,009
well yeah we should smoke some stir that

97
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:12,600
shit I just need like cuz I'm just doing

98
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,449
like a super like high-end canvas

99
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,390
lifestyle like farmstand store

100
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:20,899
top-shelf stuff these two used to be

101
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,899
present

102
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:28,060
it's all that's all just not even that

103
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:29,348
hard if Marian if Brandon if Brandon

104
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,519
let's me I'll do it to this one right in

105
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:31,748
front of you two and you'll see you know

106
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,889
what I mean I could tell he was like I

107
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:39,310
don't know who's gonna do it I'm like

108
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:41,829
dude it's gonna do it like watch I think

109
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,959
it just homogenized it all into one and

110
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:45,728
the terpenes are solvent unto itself so

111
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,008
it's literally dissolving it and making

112
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:50,348
it just homogenized in my opinion and it

113
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:51,939
will stay like that yeah you know how

114
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:53,918
this will just kind of get drier and

115
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:55,870
drier and drier it'll stay like that

116
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,430
stay like that you know what I mean

117
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,769
which I'm not saying it's better I'm

118
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,259
just saying like I think I like the

119
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:04,838
wetter stuff that's all I'm saying it's

120
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:07,629
easier to grab like it's louder you know

121
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:11,639
what I'm saying like it's yeah that's

122
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:19,770
all I'm not saying like it's just yet

123
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:19,769
the new rage no that's why I'm saying

124
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,870
yeah

125
00:06:49,730 --> 00:07:00,300
is everything you hoped for and more

126
00:06:53,899 --> 00:07:04,229
stuff firebrand it's really good yeah

127
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:06,960
totally I'm stoked this is the CG gay me

128
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:22,379
right I'm stoked I'm doubling to grow

129
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:47,159
that right like chapstick like chapstick

130
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:48,750
turps covers your mouth yeah your body

131
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,080
can kind of take it though you know what

132
00:07:48,750 --> 00:08:03,759
I mean it's not like it's just so clean

133
00:07:52,079 --> 00:08:06,279
man just absorbs it wants it who's nice

134
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,719
somebody I'll do it you want don't you

135
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:32,500
you want one don't you I see you back

136
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:34,120
there do they agree with you agree with

137
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,159
you your body likes it man I'm telling

138
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,549
you I've smoked a lot of different shit

139
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,939
in my day and yeah that's what I'm

140
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:44,529
saying just the way it should be

141
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,620
it's the closest representation of the

142
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:49,750
flower in my opinion you know it in my

143
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,519
opinion as weird as it sounds like smoke

144
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,409
and flower cool that they is smoking the

145
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,019
flower but like I feel like when you

146
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:58,839
smoke the flower it's never like when

147
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,340
you harvested that flower in my opinion

148
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,649
or that's what I'm trying to achieve

149
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,910
when you dry and cure flower like I feel

150
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:07,329
like you're trying to like be like

151
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:09,779
perfume extraction yeah you know but uh

152
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,900
I don't know it's the drying process

153
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:15,970
obviously terpenes dissipate something

154
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:18,009
happens yeah yeah for sure and I'm not

155
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,269
saying it's it just changes that's all

156
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,639
I'm saying I'm not saying it's better

157
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:34,329
I'm not saying it's worse but to me this

158
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:37,860
is the closest it's the live resin live

159
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:40,180
resident of hash charros hand rash

160
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,240
rubbing these hash plants that we make

161
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:44,829
and like on this with our hands like

162
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,810
they used to do traditionally and I did

163
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,360
that I did that like a couple months ago

164
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:50,919
like I had to plan it so yeah yeah yeah

165
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,389
totally like I harvested like three

166
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,370
quarters of it and I just like got the

167
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:56,860
last like you know little bud sea buds

168
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,320
and stuff but so I'll go in rub them all

169
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,899
and I did about an hour and a half or

170
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,480
two hours and I got like

171
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,249
half grams after I collected it all up

172
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,019
and I mean it was cream like the

173
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:09,480
creamiest cream it was darker than all

174
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:12,568
this stuff on the table but it tasted

175
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,430
just like all this stuff on the table it

176
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:18,058
was it was a trip and I mean I feel like

177
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:20,308
it was still alive it was alive like he

178
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:22,110
just said like no extraction right and

179
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:24,600
we didn't lose though the terpenes yet

180
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:28,800
this was the most like quickest way to

181
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,928
get a fresh plant from harvest time into

182
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,118
your lungs and like it be the right like

183
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:34,828
it there's no moisture in between you

184
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:36,209
know like with us making water hash and

185
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:38,219
pressing it or doing everything between

186
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:41,669
yeah terpenes are lost and like time and

187
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,790
in between so this hand hash and then

188
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:46,649
like collecting it and like fucking

189
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:48,028
dabbing it that's a fucking trick watch

190
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,249
that's gonna come around I'm gonna do

191
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:52,169
that shit next you can get yourself a

192
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:59,220
leather look and you just run through

193
00:10:52,169 --> 00:11:01,799
the field well it's to get that fucking

194
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,990
the corn is super fucking high so I like

195
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,419
you know you see where this is done and

196
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,649
it's on the other side of the world and

197
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:09,149
you know I damned some of these people

198
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:11,068
just for the hell of it and it was like

199
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,620
yo tell me how to you know what's your

200
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:15,838
tech on just hand hash and they were

201
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,178
like the best you know the professionals

202
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,679
only wrote the note 3 to 5 times and

203
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,600
then drop it and go to the next row so

204
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:24,299
it's like they just want the best they

205
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,189
just want the easiest the lightest the

206
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,958
quickest heads of all right and and then

207
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:30,149
no particulates it's really about no

208
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,278
particulates too because along you you

209
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:34,589
rub one nugget a little bit of the

210
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,178
pistils the hairs so they'll come off

211
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:38,040
and get stuck into your hand hash and

212
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:40,409
then you got in between nugs there's

213
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:43,620
this like you see tech code they just

214
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:45,389
rub it off just like rub rub rub flick

215
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,970
it off the hairs and then you know also

216
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:50,068
dust will be a part of that and from the

217
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,350
you know dirt in the air and shit like

218
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:54,208
that so lightly rubbing nugs going to

219
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,009
the next one to the next one is this

220
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:58,159
like highest grade of like hand hash and

221
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:00,480
then they say like the you know the

222
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,740
rookies of hand hash I guess where they

223
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,438
call it whatever in the hills like

224
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,860
they'll rub you know the partner alright

225
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:07,078
though

226
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,289
yeah they'll rub the second run a lot

227
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,478
harder out too

228
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:11,889
and they'll be learning at the same time

229
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,089
because they'll be you know younger in

230
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:15,159
the village or whatever but they'll

231
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,379
learn I'm sure in their hand hashes a

232
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:19,028
lot darker and you could see that and so

233
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:20,649
it's it's a trip to see qualities on

234
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:22,629
just people's hands like we have in jars

235
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:24,970
and on the table and bags you know in

236
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:27,759
this in the workplace of washing and

237
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,499
it's a trip but I'm gonna start doing

238
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,749
that next year I think I'm gonna dislike

239
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:33,759
dedicate like a plant or like a chunk of

240
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:35,649
the hoop just like all hand hash and

241
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,509
like course it'll be like head snatch it

242
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:43,359
but everyone will see it all I'll post

243
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:44,829
all batter yeah signing on a market

244
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:47,229
level yeah it's almost so hard you know

245
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:48,849
to have like hand like hash like they're

246
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:50,889
gonna want gloves involved they're gonna

247
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,319
want all that and I'm not about that I'm

248
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:55,269
gonna do this my hands I'll smoke all

249
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:57,278
what's on my hands I'm sure Amanda will

250
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:58,808
do some of hers she'll smoke what's all

251
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,328
for her hands and we'll like you know

252
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:03,308
it'll be like a community thing I'll

253
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:08,409
invite a bunch of my Brazilian friends

254
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:10,659
over and yeah they just like tell me all

255
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,608
the time like just like they just love

256
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:14,078
to dry trim and get finger hash like

257
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:15,850
that and like smoke those spliff so

258
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,528
they're gonna you know lose their mind

259
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,028
and well it's okay it's going to be I

260
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:23,438
think a traditional party I'll probably

261
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:48,100
start creating Larry is that what you're

262
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:50,828
2 trimmers are doing I always my

263
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,449
trimmers to work on certain plants like

264
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:54,158
I you know from all the different like

265
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:55,688
Pinos or certain things in the garden

266
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:57,639
like we harvest them we label them and

267
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:59,588
like I'll trim the ones that I know need

268
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:01,808
to be trimmed by me because it's that

269
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:03,039
like severe of equality you know loss if

270
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:05,198
someone else is doing it without the

271
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:08,558
education and knowledge and it's like

272
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,118
whoa so I tell them all the time yeah

273
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:12,038
there's no scissors involved with some

274
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:15,129
of our with our head staff stuff that

275
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:16,879
will do pounds and pounds of the buds

276
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:23,389
are dense enough

277
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:24,860
you know the herb is sit there all day

278
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:27,519
two pounds easy yeah

279
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:49,159
well and we're not doing like any of

280
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:51,110
these will all be top yeah you know I'm

281
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:54,889
gonna make charros at a freaking plant

282
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,389
in the future and the amount of you know

283
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:58,549
I'll talk to those people like I said i

284
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:00,230
DM some of the you know Eastern people

285
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:03,049
in the past and they said like they get

286
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:05,600
four to six grams average maybe 10 grams

287
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:08,508
max a day doing it all day

288
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,699
you know I was getting two grams in an

289
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:13,068
hour and a half so like I thought like

290
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:17,088
we're gonna see like a half ounce come

291
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:18,679
around pretty easily I think so don't

292
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:20,149
mark my words but I'm gonna go shoot for

293
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:30,500
a half ounce and you're gonna be out

294
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:32,028
there with them I think you'd be

295
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,438
surprised you have some pictures on my

296
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:37,250
phone I'll show you that or just like

297
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:49,578
the cream look just again just from

298
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:54,438
harvesting fresh frozen right and I'm

299
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:56,388
just an experiment you know yeah it's

300
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:58,159
not it's not something that's gonna be

301
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,470
like frickin profitable and like

302
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,328
anything that anyone should be doing for

303
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,639
them fuckin market this is like strictly

304
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:12,919
head stash connoisseur you know the

305
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:15,500
finest wine type shit so you do it

306
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:17,479
yourself or you know you got to come sit

307
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,169
at the the round table here you know and

308
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:24,399
like smoke with the Knights type of shit

309
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:24,399
you know because it's

310
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,329
my life I spent that much time with the

311
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:34,870
local making my own for that very very

312
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:37,929
reason because the stash of the local is

313
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:40,328
not for sale you want that quality or

314
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:43,028
you make it yourself are you willing you

315
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:46,028
will smoke it with the local if you go

316
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:54,389
as far as going there but it's not for

317
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:58,120
sale now is a tool we can make much more

318
00:16:54,389 --> 00:17:00,959
quantity of quality like to make my

319
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:05,380
stash I needed three to four months

320
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:08,558
minimum for my one year of smoking so to

321
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:12,459
make like just one stars of one person

322
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:17,048
when it's all by hand or even sitting to

323
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:21,159
get a kilo two kilo of first grade you

324
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:23,949
