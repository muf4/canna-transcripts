1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:11,250
[Music]

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:14,730
you are at spannabis so one maybe talk

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,500
about like what you're seen in Europe

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,410
like if you're seeing any differences in

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,320
the European or specifically the

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:24,359
Barcelona market and then like NorCal

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,910
and then kind of trans you see yeah yeah

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,890
well it's a trip because I'm gonna go

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,130
back a little bit in time but I learned

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,259
from Europeans originally how to make

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,210
hash I learned from Mila back in the

12
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,780
early 2000s I traveled to Europe in

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,100
Amsterdam and learn from Mila and

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,079
nowadays me and Mila travel the world

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,270
teaching and Mila will say things like

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,939
how nicotine me about fresh frozen and

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,350
talk Europe about fresh frozen so you

18
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,058
know I think a lot of the American

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:57,239
market learned from Europe originally

20
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:59,789
we've now since given a lot of tips and

21
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,919
trends to the European market and we've

22
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,198
now just been trading a lot of tech back

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,290
and forth I've done live demonstrations

24
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:11,849
in Europe for over ten years now from

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,680
Amsterdam to now Barcelona and teaching

26
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:15,989
a lot of technique in that realm doing

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,060
live demonstrations but also receiving a

28
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:19,920
lot of information and learning every

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,450
single day that I go out there you know

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,009
the power system is different in Europe

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,868
than it is you know I say it's just even

32
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:30,299
converters for the harvest right freeze

33
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:31,739
dryers you know there's there's some

34
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,360
cool things happening in Europe cool

35
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,819
trends one of the coolest things that I

36
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:39,328
see is Europe has the opportunity to do

37
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:41,489
a lot more large-scale Fino hunting so

38
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:44,908
they're able to do pop a million seeds

39
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:46,438
in in Morocco in places like that phenol

40
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,560
hunt and Morocco and bring back those

41
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,179
keepers to Spain I've seen Fino hunts on

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,570
a larger scale than what I've seen in

43
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,680
the United States so I've seen a lot of

44
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:58,968
hash strings you know they're seeing

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,469
really cool numbers and terpene profiles

46
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:04,259
from the strains that they're Fino

47
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:06,489
hunting for making hash I want to big up

48
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,330
people like la colada

49
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:15,068
in Barcelona people like HQ slight over

50
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:18,430
there at the HQ lab people like la

51
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:20,799
sagrada farm turps army just crushing it

52
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,120
out there in the solvent list world and

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
it's really cool to see because they're

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,810
piping that whole mechanical separated

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,030
side of things the salt on the side a

56
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,479
lot more than the United States Europe

57
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,729
has grown up smoking hash so it's really

58
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,988
cool to see them bringing this quality

59
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:37,060
of hash that we're seeing this in the

60
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,150
United States that same high-end quality

61
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,830
of our live rosin things like that and

62
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,019
taking it to another level as well I'm

63
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:47,080
gonna mention lock a lotta again because

64
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:49,450
they've gotten even further than the US

65
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,150
with our rows and coins lock Lauda's now

66
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:54,429
laser etching their rosin coins with

67
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,260
logos and people's images so they made

68
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,310
me one with my essential extracts image

69
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:01,870
on it and so just some cool artistic

70
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,110
factions to the solid in this world out

71
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,980
there

72
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:12,610
now you mentioned solvent list do you do

73
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:15,699
you personally operate within so since

74
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,739
day one I've really promoted and stood

75
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:20,798
behind solvent list back in the early

76
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:23,370
2000s when we started making hash there

77
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,590
wasn't a lot of information out there on

78
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,379
hydrocarbons butane specifically and the

79
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:32,560
heavy metals and things left behind we

80
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:34,509
didn't have all the purge technology we

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,829
didn't even have closed loops back then

82
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:42,280
in the early 2000s so after you know 15

83
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:45,280
excuse me 15 years or so I've learned so

84
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,849
much when it comes to the hydrocarbon

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,579
side and solvent side of things that we

86
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:53,799
now are working on some products that

87
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:56,709
we're utilizing hydrocarbons and ethanol

88
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,500
and other chemical solvents because in

89
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,299
reality in a solvent las' lab that i've

90
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,150
been operating in for the last 10 to 15

91
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:06,599
years you know making water hash and dry

92
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,549
sieve and mechanical separated products

93
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,650
we've noticed that a lot of the strains

94
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,109
and a lot of the material I get are just

95
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,579
not viable in that mechanical world but

96
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:17,199
they may be extremely viable in the

97
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,970
hydrocarbon world we may actually be

98
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,720
able to pull a lot more of those viable

99
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,350
turf

100
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,680
and the oils via different chemical

101
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:29,020
solvents that pull different parts of

102
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,180
the plant basically so a good example

103
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:34,539
and this is an old-school example but I

104
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,610
like to use it blue dream in solvent

105
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,840
list that original cut clone only blue

106
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:43,120
dream yields maybe between 1 and 5

107
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,709
percent but when we run it via

108
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,269
hydrocarbons we're actually able to

109
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:49,060
retain a lot of those terpenes and we're

110
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:52,839
seeing 18 to 24 percent yields that same

111
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,519
strain so it's a viability thing and

112
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,469
it's also a quality thing you know when

113
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:59,019
we run it mechanically or solvent Leslee

114
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,420
we retain a lot more though that waxy

115
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:03,310
cuticle on the outside whereas the

116
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,949
hydrocarbons are rupturing it and

117
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:10,740
they're able to separate it a lot easier

118
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:14,170
I think it's a great thing because it's

119
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,790
created a market for that strain and

120
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,770
there's other strains now like that that

121
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,360
have a similar trichome structure so I

122
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:20,500
just used blue dream as an example I

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,470
know that there's a lot of hate these

124
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,300
days on blue dream it kind of got played

125
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,890
out you know like a lot of other things

126
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,169
in this world where people just over

127
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,550
consume it they liked it a lot in the

128
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:32,019
beginning it yields well for the

129
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,300
hydrocarbon side it yields well on the

130
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:36,310
flower side and then it's just kind of

131
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,730
overplayed out people sell it you know

132
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:42,759
and it just gets hyped out of the circle

133
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:47,650
basically so for your own personal

134
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:49,990
production process do you see a scenario

135
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:52,509
where maybe you do like a first press

136
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,160
solvent list to get like all the best

137
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:56,740
stuff and then take everything that's

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,620
left over and do a second there's

139
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:04,180
there's ways to create viability with

140
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:06,009
that yes for you know that's how we like

141
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,660
to test things once you find out that

142
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,459
the blue dream is not going to be good

143
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,090
and solving this we're not gonna run it

144
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:15,819
and solvent us however when we find a

145
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:18,729
strain like Mike MD oh gee that does

146
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:21,759
amazing in solvent lists say you know

147
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,169
I'm yielding over 28 30 percent each and

148
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,589
every time no matter who grows that

149
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:28,418
strain I run it I yield that much

150
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:31,089
there's still some by-product left in

151
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:33,339
that material that we've ran that you

152
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:36,069
can do other you know make other

153
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:39,369
works with for sure and why do you think

154
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:40,509
that yields more in the solvent listen

155
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,949
area you dream

156
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:47,319
it's a trichomes structure the chem do G

157
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:50,319
has a lot bigger of a trichome head a

158
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:53,589
thinner cuticle it breaks the head off a

159
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,418
lot easier on that chem do G compared to

160
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:57,789
breaking the head and the stocks and

161
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:59,109
some plant material on that blue dream

162
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,990
because the trichomes a lot more fragile

163
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:04,120
on the blue dream the chem d has just a

164
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,460
lot sturdier of a trichome head that

165
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,410
breaks off a lot easier plus the biggest

166
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,659
thing with it after scoping it and

167
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,550
running it and processing it to rosin

168
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,620
afterwards we've noticed that that chem

169
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,329
D and other strains you know similar in

170
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,430
nature and trichome structure have a

171
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:20,469
thinner waxy cuticle to the amount of

172
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:24,069
oils inside so the amount of oils inside

173
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:26,410
are a lot more 8090 percent oils

174
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:28,659
compared to about you know a 10% waxy

175
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,189
cuticle if not less to be completely

176
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,010
honest compared to something like blue

177
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:35,350
dream which almost has 80% wax and about

178
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:37,810
20% oil and in the center of it

179
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,220
it's just how that trichome grows and

180
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,910
there's other things that you can do to

181
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,340
affect that waxy cuticle not using as

182
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,860
many salts not not using as much sugar

183
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:50,668
in man process flushing better will

184
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,439
actually grow more oil compared to wax

185
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:56,740
so flushing that turning those sugars

186
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,779
into oils in that end process of the

187
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,050
flowering plant will definitely help

188
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:04,959
reduce your wax to oil ratio so as an

189
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:09,430
extraction artist you're definitely

190
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:11,500
reliant on cultivators who are some of

191
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:15,579
the cultivators that you love working

192
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,098
with yeah you know there's a lot and

193
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,709
I've operated out in Colorado for a long

194
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:23,050
time we worked with you know some close

195
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:26,439
family dank by Pank was one our main

196
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:30,848
producers in Colorado along with the 14

197
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:32,708
er the farm we had a few greenhouse

198
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:34,418
grows down in Pueblo that crushed out

199
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,369
for us as well

200
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:38,949
coming to the California market I've

201
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,719
looked at farm after farm I've done a

202
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,240
few collaborations there's a few out

203
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,760
there on the shelves right now as we

204
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,269
speak some of my favorite farms to run

205
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,240
fresh

206
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:51,100
and so far been Callie kosher that farm

207
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,379
is crushing out there greenhouses are

208
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:57,000
amazing the strains are proper and where

209
00:08:53,379 --> 00:09:01,600
it is they're out in the Central Valley

210
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,070
out in that area yeah and yeah they're

211
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,589
they're really paying attention to

212
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,540
running strains that are good for hash

213
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:10,029
fielding finding those phenotypes and

214
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:13,329
growing them properly they're actually

215
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:15,370
kosher certified you know as we move

216
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,278
into a more regulated market we're able

217
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,360
to see more things of that nature

218
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,269
certifications clean green

219
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,889
certifications things of that nature and

220
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:25,750
I look for those certifications I want

221
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:27,309
people to be testing the soil I want

222
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,320
them to be testing their flour as much

223
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:31,769
as possible aside from the COAS that are

224
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,959
regulated to actually enter the market

225
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:37,419
so yeah proactivity is key for me and

226
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,979
what are some of the strains that

227
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:41,439
they're growing that you're sort of

228
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,629
currently excited about it yeah you know

229
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,839
we did some trials for the fresh frozen

230
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:49,389
of this for this hash cone this full

231
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,360
mount hash cone collaboration and I

232
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:54,009
really really really like the friddle's

233
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,659
forbidden fruit times skittles so that

234
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,850
one's going into play for this

235
00:09:55,659 --> 00:10:00,879
collaboration I also really like this

236
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,399
lemon bean which is a lemon tree x OG

237
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,350
Eddy leppe it's one of the first lemon

238
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,990
strains that really has that lemon rind

239
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,300
that still produces insolvent lists

240
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:14,680
because after years and years of testing

241
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:15,969
the lemon Jie the lemon tree a lot of

242
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:17,799
these lemon strains out there just don't

243
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,450
yield for mechanical separations or

244
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:23,199
solvent 'less extractions

245
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:25,270
but this lemon bean did work so so you

246
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,778
mentioned fresh fruit and I feel like

247
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:33,189
fresh frozen kind of came on the scene a

248
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:35,500
couple of years ago and farmers you know

249
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,660
like I remember talking to Craig from

250
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,339
talking trees farms a good friend of

251
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:42,129
mine you know

252
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:43,959
what percent of my farm of that am I

253
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:44,519
going to allocate to fresh frozen it was

254
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,969
like okay

255
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,250
like a 25% and I would assume this year

256
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,149
based on how last year one he's gonna

257
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,799
he'll like it either more or less so

258
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,590
it's a big side of what we do is it

259
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:02,009
consulting on that you know helping

260
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:03,570
farmers go from doing dry drying they

261
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:06,210
actually you know one of the big selling

262
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,790
points for me coming in is I'm able to

263
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,830
take a whole dry room convert that into

264
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:13,289
a mom stable or another flowering room

265
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,210
so you're producing more stability in

266
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:17,189
your in your farm with a mom room or

267
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,840
producing higher numbers and bigger

268
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,720
margins if you're gonna turn a dry room

269
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,639
into another flowering room you're

270
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,680
cutting down on your staff and the

271
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,720
amount of employees that you don't know

272
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,029
coming into your facility via trim staff

273
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,000
etc because you're able to buck fresh

274
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,679
frozen plants Bigley from and freeze

275
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,330
them without having a trim staff sitting

276
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,939
there over a table trimming the material

277
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,860
so we can get rid of that cost and that

278
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,980
security issue

279
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,009
and yeah just freeing up the space

280
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,409
freeing up the cost going straight into

281
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:51,389
a freezer we're coming in with freezer

282
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:54,179
trucks able to pick up this fresh frozen

283
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:56,279
material I think it just helps the

284
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,409
fluidity of a floor of a farm turning

285
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,259
over well now let's talk about during

286
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:03,539
the equation what do you like more about

287
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:05,490
getting fresh frozen material versus

288
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:06,839
what like five years ago you probably

289
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,560
weren't getting anything fresh frozen

290
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,149
right

291
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,809
I've been running fresh frozen for about

292
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:16,409
ten years now okay works so let's talk

293
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:18,839
about ten years ago the day before you

294
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:20,990
ever first at your first fresh frozen to

295
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,570
the day after and like what was the mind

296
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:27,528
like holy shit this is game-changing the

297
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,778
oil and the terpene retention you know

298
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:31,730
when we're talking about dry material

299
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:33,740
that's been handled especially if we're

300
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,060
talking about trim and the bottom of the

301
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,680
bag and things like that a lot of the

302
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:39,679
trichome heads have already broken off

303
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:41,359
without me breaking them off and when

304
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,219
they are broken off with that type of

305
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,589
agitation in the bottom of a turkey bag

306
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,300
you're grabbing a lot more plant

307
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:51,050
material and you're grabbing a lot more

308
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:53,299
of the stuff that you don't want waxes

309
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:55,729
plant material things of that nature

310
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:57,889
when I get fresh frozen material I'm

311
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,320
able to really control that variable and

312
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:02,088
break off the trichome heads properly if

313
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,010
we can keep our environment cold the

314
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:06,110
water and ice mixture cold before that

315
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:08,088
fresh frozen material hits I'm able to

316
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,940
really just break off the trichome heads

317
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:13,130
and because they're frozen straight from

318
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,110
harvest it's retaining a lot more of

319
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:16,759
those air volatile turbines the terpenes

320
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,759
that just want to escape into the air

321
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,319
just naturally so because it's fresh

322
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,600
frozen we're able to retain a lot more

323
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,760
of those and just a quality control

324
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,920
thing the less hands on that material

325
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,159
the less it's been touched and agitated

326
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:36,049
the higher quality and product we can

327
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:38,809
retain so now to talk live resin live

328
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:40,909
resin compared to live rosin or just in

329
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:44,750
general I feel like that's sort of new

330
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:46,699
wish to the scene live resin really hit

331
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,669
the the commercial market at the same

332
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,770
time fresh frozen hit so about 10 years

333
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:54,199
yeah really around the finish line in

334
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,929
Colorado for you yeah like I think the

335
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,509
California market on concentrates was

336
00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:02,419
Baja it was lagging Colorado it's crazy

337
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:04,490
to say that you know I'm I'm California

338
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:07,639
I'm from California I think that a lot

339
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:09,680
of Californians you know would probably

340
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,838
agree but be surprised you know that

341
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,269
that Colorado really pushed forward with

342
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,130
that concentrate market but in reality I

343
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,110
think one of the reasons we were in

344
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:19,338
Colorado able to push forward with the

345
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,860
concentrate market and create this

346
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:24,020
higher echelon of products is because we

347
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,629
came with regulation first Colorado was

348
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:29,958
the first to implement these new laws of

349
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:33,620
regulation recreational tightening down

350
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:35,869
on all the compliance side of things

351
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,240
and uh you know we were able to write

352
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,089
things down first in Colorado I moved

353
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,240
back to Colorado to operate essential

354
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:47,660
extracts in 2009 because Colorado was

355
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,909
the first place to allow me to pay taxes

356
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:51,889
on hashish California wouldn't let me

357
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:55,069
yet so Colorado really gave me the

358
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:58,189
opportunity to study and to write these

359
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:02,120
things down and to replicate our

360
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,830
processes so it's it's crazy to say but

361
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,419
I think that Colorado really stepped up

362
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,910
game when it came to concentrates and

363
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:09,229
did exceed California for a minute now

364
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:11,419
California is you know I'm pushing back

365
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,610
with the regulatory system that's coming

366
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:16,088
into place here new recreational

367
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,110
cannabis just keep pushing that Echelon

368
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:25,640
you know only the strong will survive

369
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:28,250
right now yeah well so this is this is

370
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,110
an interesting story we had first

371
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,730
started running fresh frozen when I was

372
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,778
working with a company called pink house

373
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:39,230
in Colorado and this is 2010

374
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:40,458
so almost 10 years ago is when we really

375
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,278
started running fresh rose in the

376
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:45,199
commercial market and it's funny because

377
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,730
this this gentleman and I'm not even

378
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,940
named his name of his face in his name

379
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,070
right now but kind of a negative person

380
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,360
in our industry kept coming at me being

381
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,370
like you don't know what you're doing

382
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,690
you're not running a live material and I

383
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,519
thought about it and this was you know

384
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,290
ten years ago - I'm like eleven - what's

385
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,000
this guy talking about he's a little

386
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:04,789
kooky but he might have something with

387
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,730
that term and so we actually pulled down

388
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:12,139
this Skywalker plants I think we had a

389
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:13,700
row of six lights of Skywalker where my

390
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,939
partner at pink house was like have at

391
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,560
it try it live try it fresh and so at

392
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,110
this point we didn't even freeze that

393
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:24,229
material this was straight bucking down

394
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,879
a whole plant shucking off the big

395
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,920
leaves and chucking off the buds into a

396
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,769
fresh frozen bucket and we were hand

397
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:34,189
paddling this bucket ten years ago and

398
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:36,199
we came out with this amazing live oil

399
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,930
as what we were calling it live solvent

400
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,610
less oil and it was a lot more oily than

401
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:43,309
the dry material running a lot more

402
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:46,159
terpene heavy just potent this stuff was

403
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:48,859
crazy the Skywalker back then was og

404
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,799
Mazhar it wasn't the Skywalker og that

405
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:56,568
we know today it was an older Skywalker

406
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:58,159
Fino that was Mazzara times blueberry

407
00:16:56,568 --> 00:17:01,039
sorry I think I said oh gee

408
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:04,788
but Mazar times in mazar-i-sharif times

409
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:07,009
blueberry and had this Talat osis funk

410
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:09,588
to it and when we ran it live it was

411
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:12,818
even that much more intense the room

412
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:15,379
smelled like death in a good way and

413
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:17,869
from there we really started promoting

414
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,220
that term that live term because then we

415
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:20,869
started playing with freezing that

416
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,720
material and running it in our solvent

417
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:25,729
'less situation and we were doing

418
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,709
collaborations and working with friends

419
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,720
of ours in the industry one of those

420
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:33,080
friends and one of those companies back

421
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,269
then got together and a few of the heads

422
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,308
got together in the same room and I

423
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:39,019
might not be explaining the story how

424
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:41,869
they explained it this is exactly how I

425
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:45,168
remember it we were all at giddy-up slab

426
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:47,298
and it was kind bill and rye Pritchard

427
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:49,970
and a few of the other friends over

428
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:51,740
there at giddy up slab and we started

429
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,500
talking about how the psalmist guys were

430
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,140
doing this live material and they wanted

431
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,058
to try it fresh frozen live material in

432
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,049
the hydrocarbons set up and that's where

433
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:04,519
live rosin came from later we dubbed

434
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:07,639
live or sorry that's where live resin

435
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:11,240
came from later we dubbed the term live

436
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:16,669
rosin for fresh frozen hash that we then

437
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:19,460
pressed into rosin so live resin came

438
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:22,820
first before the term live rosin but the

439
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,558
idea of fresh frozen and running live

440
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:32,089
material actually came from the salt in

441
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:34,460
this world live resin is via hydrocarbon

442
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:37,189
butane extraction fresh frozen butane

443
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,409
extraction is live resin live rosin is

444
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,720
fresh frozen mechanical separation or

445
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:44,450
fresh frozen solvent list extraction so

446
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,230
live rosin we're running fresh frozen

447
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:51,140
material into live water hash and then

448
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,720
we press that water hash into rosin

449
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,190
that's live rosin and on the other side

450
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,460
of things they're using a closed loop

451
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,700
system

452
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,549
with jacketing and running at sub

453
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,400
temperatures here in California who are

454
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:09,960
some of the extraction artists that are

455
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:13,080
impressing you in 20 19 20 18 20 minutes

456
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,240
then there's a lot there's a lot of

457
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,129
really cool extract artists out there

458
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,039
just pushing the boundaries of what a

459
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:23,340
solvent lease extraction you know really

460
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,569
means I got friends like Rackham solvent

461
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:26,669
list that's crushing it and that

462
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:29,629
mechanically separated side soil grown

463
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:32,100
solving this is doing really good work

464
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:34,320
man there's so many like what are the

465
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:36,299
nuances of some of their technique like

466
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,460
I'm sure so you guys talk technique and

467
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,899
like how'd you like this is amazing like

468
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,519
what you do and they're like this is

469
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,570
what I did you're like holy shit that's

470
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,190
clever so what are some you know if

471
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:49,079
people are pushing the boundaries my

472
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:52,350
assumption is that's that's a technique

473
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:56,009
yeah you know on innovation compared to

474
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:58,799
making bubble hash in my uncle's hot

475
00:19:56,009 --> 00:20:01,490
barn in Mendocino you know 20 years ago

476
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,169
in an uncontrolled environment

477
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:07,099
uncontrolled mid starting material we

478
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:10,470
were making kind of brown pliable

479
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:12,839
mildewy smelling bubble hash for years

480
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,670
and things have changed a lot since then

481
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,679
we've really promoted the controlled

482
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,410
environment aspect of making water hash

483
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,789
so people are using walk-in freezers and

484
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,720
it's one of the first things I promoted

485
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:26,639
on a John Doe radio show back in

486
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,789
2009-2010 was I make my hash in a

487
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,710
walk-in freezer so after taking a look

488
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:33,990
at all these different labs via

489
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,430
collaborations in California seeing the

490
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,430
different nuances and differences

491
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,660
between different extract artists you

492
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,029
know it's it's really cool to see what

493
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,700
we came from from making hash and a hot

494
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:46,769
barn to now all of these extraction

495
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,180
artists are working in walk-in freezers

496
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:51,420
and really really controlling their

497
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,039
environment which is cool to see and

498
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,980
just the slight differences are really

499
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,049
cool to see as well I promote creating

500
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,000
an ice water bath that you have full

501
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,950
temperature control before you even put

502
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,630
your material in there I've seen some of

503
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,819
these extract artists put their material

504
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,430
on the bottom of a bucket with ice in it

505
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:09,750
and then start adding room-temperature

506
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,730
water and

507
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,319
I think it's cool that I'm able to see

508
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,210
some these differences and come in and

509
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:19,409
you know change some of their SOPs and

510
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:21,329
learn from them as well so you know it's

511
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,560
really cool to see all these changes

512
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,539
happening in our industry and people

513
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,609
sharing freely because it's pushing the

514
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:28,049
boundaries of what we can do and it's

515
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:29,669
creating a higher echelon for the

516
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:31,889
products we're making out here so talk

517
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,630
about you just mentioned SOPs what are

518
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:36,780
some of the common things when you walk

519
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,550
into someone's operation that you know

520
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:41,160
if I talk to people who consult with

521
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:42,950
cultivators it's like they don't pick a

522
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,360
couple of things that they're noticing

523
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,460
yeah one of the things that I've been

524
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,159
trying to change as I go into facilities

525
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,069
is now that a lot of people have gone

526
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,360
that walk-in freezer route it's rad and

527
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:56,039
they're working the walk-in freezer and

528
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,139
they're retaining those terpenes and the

529
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,759
stability of the product but the second

530
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,320
they walk out of their walk-in freezer

531
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,660
oftentimes these walk-in freezers are

532
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,789
placed in cultivations and other

533
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,630
facilities that aren't completely

534
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:08,490
temperature humidity controlled

535
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,080
throughout the entire facility so I've

536
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,569
been coming in and helping people design

537
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,189
the actual flow of these laboratories

538
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:16,169
and controlling the temperature and

539
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,539
humidity in the entire square foot of

540
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,759
the building through the walkways etc

541
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:22,980
it's creating a lot more shelf stability

542
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,670
is what I'm seeing because when you go

543
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,589
from your walk-in cooler to a 75 degree

544
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:30,779
50% humidity and humidity environment

545
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:33,089
you're almost mitigating you know the

546
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:35,009
fact that you're using that control in

547
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:36,740
the walk-in freezer by coming out into

548
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:39,359
that environment so I've been helping

549
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,009
facilities with not only their launch

550
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,240
but they're built out at this point it's

551
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:44,009
one of the cool things that I've learned

552
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,380
just coming from a psychology background

553
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:49,109
and a hash making background I've now

554
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,540
done you know learn to design and Sketch

555
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:54,299
up and convert that into CAD and help

556
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:56,639
these companies come online with a

557
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,269
proper infrastructure and actually

558
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:11,880
building

559
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:11,879
