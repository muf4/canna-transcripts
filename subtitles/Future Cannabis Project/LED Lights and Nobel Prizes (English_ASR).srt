2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:12,679
revolutions how many about this lady

3
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:16,019
revolution okay so the energy that comes

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:18,109
to us it from the universe

5
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:21,739
it's the electromagnetic radiation

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:26,279
electromagnetic waves the

7
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:29,809
electromagnetic waves are the basic of

8
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:32,668
all the biological and physics phenomena

9
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:36,000
in the universe not only in the earth

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:40,409
and this is the basic of everything we

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,439
know if it's the life the rain the food

12
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:49,019
the air we breathe everything comes from

13
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:52,049
there the LED revolution is that now

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:58,320
today we know to create that energy

15
00:00:52,049 --> 00:01:04,408
using a little bit of electricity so we

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:08,819
know how to use not many electrons to

17
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:12,750
produce a lot of photons when this

18
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:15,868
happens it changed all the balance of

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,640
energy in the universe today that's the

20
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,129
reason this revolution is affecting

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,129
everything we know the TV we are

22
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:26,129
watching the telephone we are using the

23
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:28,739
light in in the streets in the houses

24
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,209
and in the automobiles today the

25
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,569
automobiles today's in Europe are

26
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:37,969
already LED everything by low because we

27
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:41,159
reduce considerably the

28
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:46,250
energy we use in the past to create the

29
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:51,329
light so what happened in the

30
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:54,299
horticultural market is that in order to

31
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:58,099
feed the plants we are using all only

32
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:02,579
specific wavelengths like such as the

33
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:06,599
450 nanometers and the 660 nanometers

34
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,990
and the 730 nanometers so we know we do

35
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,509
not need to use all the spectrum and

36
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:15,629
when you do the plants specifically what

37
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:20,039
they need and you can even calculate the

38
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:24,210
receipt you can affect to the test to

39
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:28,199
the taste I mean and in the quality of

40
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,849
what we are eating today so everything

41
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,399
comes together when we are growing

42
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:37,889
cannabis because in the cannabis you

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,260
need so much energy that we use the

44
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:44,789
cannabis today as a guide to the future

45
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:47,849
articles or crops and this is what we do

46
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:49,859
in our company we try to create the

47
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:53,099
maximum quantity of photons using the

48
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:57,860
minimum of electrons talked about kind

49
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,859
of outside that 400 to 700

50
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:05,449
are you because the Sun provides no

51
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,380
special price and I feel like a lot of

52
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:09,589
lights

53
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:12,409
focus on you know the bell curve 400 and

54
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,450
700 and what's light Sun our

55
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:17,629
understanding of plants and their

56
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:20,539
reaction to the full spectrum okay

57
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:22,099
there's that so are your lights focused

58
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:25,939
on that bell curve or they also

59
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:28,489
exploring past no no I will I understand

60
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:30,889
your question you say if the Sun

61
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:36,620
provides all respect to why we need only

62
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:40,669
this specific spectrum so first of all

63
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,980
as I started to say the basic of the

64
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:45,669
energy we use is not coming only from

65
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:50,179
the Sun it's only also coming from the

66
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:54,769
from the space and we can see only a

67
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,409
small part of the spectrum not only the

68
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,390
full spectrum because you have also

69
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:02,590
infrared light that is beyond our

70
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:05,958
capacity to see and you have also

71
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,269
ultraviolet light that is more than our

72
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,120
capacity to see and when you go to

73
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:14,000
higher frequencies I mean less

74
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,600
wavelength the energy those photons

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,728
carry are much higher in the effect I

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,430
will skin and they can kill us very

77
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:26,000
easily if you go to x-rays or gamma rays

78
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:30,228
and from but the spectrum we we see is

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,160
from 400 to 700 as you said but the

80
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:37,939
plants they done it on the spectrum they

81
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,450
need exactly four hundred fifty six

82
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:45,680
hundred sixty and 730 that's the reason

83
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:48,649
we know how to give them specific what

84
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,509
they use even some of the spectrums

85
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:59,859
could be harmful for from for plants and

86
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:59,860
this is the energy basic photosynthetic

87
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:11,159
phenomena but if you're talking about a

88
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:18,329
other phenomenas the price the the cost

89
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:20,129
of those clubs well was not economic in

90
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:23,038
the past to use this kind of light

91
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:25,919
because was very expensive to create

92
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,468
it's not is there is nothing new new and

93
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,959
what i told you what is new is the way

94
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:36,209
to create those wavelength in a very low

95
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:41,249
cost because in places like Holland they

96
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:44,668
used to use to cultural life for many

97
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:51,088
many years using other technologies like

98
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:52,618
HPS or all metal halide but they didn't

99
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:55,499
care because they didn't had to pay a

100
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:59,819
lot of money for having fresh food in

101
00:05:55,499 --> 00:06:03,088
the winter or you all growing tulips in

102
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:09,169
the winter but today things are changing

103
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:12,418
because in the next 20 years the

104
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:17,329
population of the earth will grow to ten

105
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:17,329
billion and we need to increase by 60%

106
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:26,699
agriculture harvesting in all the world

107
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,740
and the only way to do that the only way

108
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,679
to do that is using those technologies

109
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,800
today so we are creating the future or

110
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:36,538
filling the the earth this is what I'm

111
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,569
trying to tell you at the beginning is

112
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:46,110
not only how to grow cannabis is how to

113
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:50,819
feed the world today the cannabis is a

114
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:53,788
fast train that we jumping on in but in

115
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:55,769
the future all the food will change this

116
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,878
kind of course when you're talking

117
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:59,949
equality vader's in terms

118
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,740
you know how to dial in the lights

119
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:07,869
during different phases of growth like

120
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:14,800
Rudy Tootie and you want some glow tips

121
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:23,459
this is what yes okay for cloning or

122
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:27,550
routing use a full-spectrum light 5700

123
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:34,629
Kelvin which is not expensive should be

124
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:40,528
not expensive for for a vegetative stage

125
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:43,569
you need to use more blue if you are

126
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:46,718
growing in an indoor you don't need

127
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:50,528
white you don't need full reduce you

128
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:53,848
juice just use a 60 70 percent blue 30%

129
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:57,069
of red if you if you do go to the

130
00:07:53,848 --> 00:08:01,449
flowering stage you need a lot of power

131
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:08,499
so you need to use for rails 730 about

132
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:11,649
5% use HIPAA rate 60% and 30% 35% use

133
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:13,509
blue this is my tip from today but they

134
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:15,728
are changing in the time independence of

135
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:18,908
the type of grow you are doing the type

136
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:22,360
of Club for nurseries we are providing

137
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:26,889
as I told you 5700 s what the market

138
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:33,490
asked from us today about 300 micro

139
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:36,430
moles ppfd this is our the best results

140
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:40,538
we are having today we have one growing

141
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:43,469
in Israel also in the initial we grow

142
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:47,230
only medical cannabis legally I mean

143
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:50,680
they use in 3000 Kelvin but depends of

144
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:55,269
the photo biologics he is the one who

145
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:59,409
decides which kind exactly of spectrum

146
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:03,938
to live but the common

147
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:09,519
used today's 5700 Kelvin which is a lot

148
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:14,708
of blue for the Clones 300 micromoles

149
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:19,959
for the vegetating stage usually you

150
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:23,649
need about 400 micromoles more blue than

151
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:26,948
white as done red as said before and for

152
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:30,879
the flowering you need a lot of red in

153
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:33,458
about 700 800 megawatts per square feet

154
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,339
per square meter sorry when you use in

155
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:39,608
artificial light it doesn't matter if

156
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:42,369
it's a greenhouse or an indoor crop

157
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:44,829
because in a green house you still need

158
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:47,069
the same quantity of lot of light but

159
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:50,438
you need to use that less electricity

160
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:53,019
because you are adding the sunlight to

161
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:55,988
your crops and then you don't need to

162
00:09:53,019 --> 00:10:00,609
use white at all in the greenhouse you

163
00:09:55,989 --> 00:10:05,739
don't need to use why in israel or is it

164
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:09,158
only indoor 90% is greenhouse yes

165
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:12,129
because we are the country of the Sun we

166
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:14,649
shall have a lot of Sun but now we are

167
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:18,639
providing with the biggest and maybe

168
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:20,828
most sophisticated indoor system maybe

169
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,808
in the world that we are providing today

170
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:25,418
what some of the research has been done

171
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:26,850
by the university that you're like wow

172
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:39,948
that's actually

173
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:44,159
oh the need for the white its new and

174
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:47,278
also they want more green in the white

175
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,368
than before in the flowering stage we

176
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:53,278
are surprised playing today you even can

177
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:55,259
see here and white with a lot of green

178
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:59,239
this is something new

179
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:03,839
nobody believed default that using green

180
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:06,329
light will help so this is a small tip

181
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,339
okay that I can tell you and this is new

182
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:12,328
research that's proven and actually you

183
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:15,919
do need every day you are getting new

184
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:20,638
data from new growers and also for the

185
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:25,649
we have a our partner is Ostrom which is

186
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,850
the biggest cheap producer for LED

187
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:29,339
lighting

188
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:34,100
they have 56 percent of the world market

189
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:38,129
and this is another input we have and

190
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:41,519
all this data is coming to us and it's

191
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:43,678
what we provide to the growers and every

192
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,119
day is changing because you are learning

193
00:11:43,678 --> 00:11:51,478
every day is so new because until now

194
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:55,470
when you work with the metal halide or H

195
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:58,559
HP s technologies you use to work with

196
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:01,769
white but now when you can dominate the

197
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:04,618
spectrum you can give exactly exactly

198
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:07,139
different spectrum according to your

199
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:09,720
results it's a different story

200
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:12,058
that's the does the rule LED revolution

201
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:17,158
that you can give exactly what you need

202
00:12:12,058 --> 00:12:20,278
to give and even improving improving the

203
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:23,038
quality of the crop and yell by

204
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:25,168
different light recipes that you you

205
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:29,100
could never gave it before you can

206
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:31,619
program when when to give the light like

207
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,439
we call it photo periodical treatment

208
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:37,019
you can give how you can control what

209
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:39,949
what will be the intensity and you can

210
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:44,799
control the spectrum

211
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:48,730
so by doing this you not only are

212
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:56,000
accelerating biological process you also

213
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:59,389
can improve the the different conditions

214
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,009
of the product you want to sell in the

215
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:07,250
next let's say ten years do you see

216
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:11,208
kind of iterative improvement of LED

217
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:16,669
technology or some new emerging light

218
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:20,619
technology that would supersede LED look

219
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:24,948
I am an engineer with some physical

220
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:30,459
experience I cannot see something better

221
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:33,859
than the LED today because the LED is

222
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:36,259
extremely exciting technology only in

223
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,459
the five years you have two Nobel Prizes

224
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:43,909
Yoshika Nakamura and Nietzsche two Nobel

225
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:46,789
prizes for more of the same technology

226
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:50,179
okay and I can explain you what was what

227
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:53,958
was the the reason each one got his

228
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:56,359
Nobel Prize but the revolution is so big

229
00:13:53,958 --> 00:14:00,609
and we are only in the beginning because

230
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:03,190
the efficiency is ascending day by day

231
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:07,730
okay

232
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:13,420
today they are LEDs that are able to

233
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:13,420
provide about 5 micromoles per watt and

234
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:21,009
traditional HPS light will provide one

235
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:25,528
micromolar

236
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:28,809
per watt so we are five times better and

237
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:31,629
it is improving day by day using the

238
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:34,569
same LED technology I don't see yet a

239
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:37,838
better technology than the LED but maybe

240
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:40,600
it would be so there's nothing currently

241
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,180
under horizon that you're like don't be

242
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:50,259
promising I don't think I see is that

243
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:54,759
they think about the farmer the farmer

244
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:58,240
is the victimís of everything it's you

245
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:01,980
cannot you we say initial that the

246
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:09,940
farmer it's a business that depends on

247
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:13,389
God only on God again yes mercy God

248
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:16,410
mercy if you have dry seasons what

249
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:22,720
seasons change of climate

250
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:25,088
yes Newell's coming from from China or

251
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,019
other you have to compete with everyone

252
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:32,140
you have also the middleman the

253
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:35,259
mentleman the chain and marketing issues

254
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:37,569
that are affecting your life you cannot

255
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:38,470
program your life now when you have this

256
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,560
technology

257
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,519
you become suddenly a businessman you

258
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:48,539
can project exactly what you are growing

259
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,220
it's change look I am a high tech

260
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:53,409
engineer all my life was working with

261
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,829
high tech now suddenly I'm working with

262
00:15:53,409 --> 00:16:00,129
the horticulture is for me is extremely

263
00:15:56,828 --> 00:16:03,939
exciting I never imagined in the past

264
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:06,789
that my my future will be doing feeding

265
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,949
the people with the high tech and this

266
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:12,610
is what's happening today it's a process

267
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:15,969
that you won't stop and will change if

268
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:18,699
you ask me what to suggest to children

269
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,790
to study in university go and study

270
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:22,939
agronomy this is a very good business I

271
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:25,009
believe it is

272
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,710
business of the future is the last

273
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:30,529
question you mentioned two Nobel Prize

274
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:33,080
winners mentioned someone else who's

275
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:35,899
doing who is done research and led that

276
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:38,509
you think deserves some love no like

277
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:41,689
them no no not yet so those who are like

278
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:43,850
up here yes they did because remember

279
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,160
the LED technology also exists about

280
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,759
forty years ago but the revolution came

281
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:53,929
in the past in the in the five six seven

282
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:57,110
years in each developed the technologies

283
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:59,959
to create the blood to produce the lunar

284
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:03,649
they blue LED with a very good price and

285
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,600
the Nakamura developed the first for

286
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,000
technology to convert the blue light

287
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,939
into white light into what you call it

288
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,759
full spectrum and what years for the

289
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,799
small part like in the 80s the 90s no no

290
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,849
no the thousands the to thousands yeah

291
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:23,359
yeah yeah in the I think both normal

292
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:25,579
price were in the last seven years its

293
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:29,949
newest technology and you see how we

294
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:29,949
affect our effect everything you touch
