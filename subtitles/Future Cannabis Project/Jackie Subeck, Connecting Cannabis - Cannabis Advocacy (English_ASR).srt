1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:08,000
there seems to be a disconnect in this

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:10,120
industry um we have we seem to have a

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,359
weird line that's going down the middle

4
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:15,039
of this industry we seem to have people

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,320
that are fighting the fight working on

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,439
the rags working on the policy working

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,320
on the ordinances spending time with

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,160
State County City officials trying to

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,240
make sure that we all have Fair

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,198
Equitable and inclusive cannabis policy

11
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,320
going forward because let's remember

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,960
this is the first and only time Cali

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,359
will do this the first time so it's

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,840
really up to us to make sure that we get

15
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,119
it right as right as we possibly can

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,840
given the limitations and circumstances

17
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,159
that may happen um in in you know with

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,640
everything going on and and for how many

19
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,839
people in the room let's just quick do

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,960
show hands how many people in the room

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,640
keep up as much as they possibly can on

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,920
all of the rags and everything that's

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,159
going on right so it's about a third of

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,760
the room now the rest of you do are you

25
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,560
nervous are you scared are you is it too

26
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,478
overwhelming uh it's overwhelming CU I I

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,118
can understand that right so we have an

28
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,840
over how many people feel it's

29
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:13,599
overwhelming there we go that's about

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,640
the same amount of people some of the

31
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:20,039
same people that are fighting feel it's

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,478
overwhelming um so good okay so what I

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,320
wanted to try to do tonight is sort of

34
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:28,640
shine a light on The Advocates and the

35
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,599
nonprofits because here's the deal those

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,239
are the people who are making all this

37
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,599
happen those are the people who are

38
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,000
working hard with all of the the the

39
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:40,199
government at to make sure that there is

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,879
a solid foundation for businesses to sit

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,759
on top of and actually make money we the

42
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,319
other side of the coin is those people

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,118
who are in it for the money only or

44
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,798
they're in it for their own

45
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,319
self-interests and they're not

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,479
contributing back so we have a problem I

47
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,519
think we need to talk about it it really

48
00:01:55,478 --> 00:02:00,118
hasn't been talked about that much I

49
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,759
really just want to commend everybody in

50
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:02,759
this room for showing up tonight because

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,560
I'm going to tell you I'm going to be

52
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,000
totally completely honest with you this

53
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,560
was a hard topic to get people in the

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,159
room for and it breaks my heart because

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,479
there's all kinds of people in this room

56
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,199
that fight every single day and yet we

57
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,439
couldn't get people here for this topic

58
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,919
we were joking about it that if we said

59
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,878
hey here's a way to make money in the

60
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:25,559
Cannabis industry we'd pack the room but

61
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,318
here we are saying no here's a way to

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,878
support the industry so we can all make

63
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,799
money hopefully one day as well and we

64
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:36,120
had we're pulling teeth to get people

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,680

66
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,400

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,680
about so I want to get I want to drill

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,800
down into that topic tonight because we

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,560
we have so many amazing people and

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,879
organizations that are out there every

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,280
single day making sure that there's good

72
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,560
policy that's it really simple and so a

73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,959
whole bunch of them are going to talk to

74
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,239

you're going to get a really wide

77
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,878
picture of what this is all about if you

78
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,279
don't know you're going to learn a lot

79
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,719
and if you do know you're still going to

80
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,560
learn and so that's just really where we

81
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,759
want to go and I wanted to like stress

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,840

who are really doing some of the heavy

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,719
lifting they're struggling for financing

99
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,360
they're struggling for funding why is

100
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,799
that these are the people who helped

101
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,439
carry the the Baton over the line and

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,519
get us to legalization and yet we can't

103
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,039
seem to get them funded so and it's not

104
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,120
just them there's a lot of people who

105
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:58,919
work in this industry every day who get

106
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,360
no dollars zero dollars but they're

107
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,078
still going and doing it because they

108
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,720
believe that it's the right thing to do

109
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,959

129
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:58,079
Little Red Hen where a hen finds a grain

130

of wheat and goes around asking all the

131
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,719
other farm animals to help make get into

132
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,079
bread but no one will help finally when

133
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,240
the hen manages all on her own to make

134
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,399
the bread everyone who wouldn't help

135
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,240
