1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,989
[Music]

2
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:23,759
I'm going to start by recalling back uh

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,160
as a Junior High kid when um this was

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,118
late 50s when it was all the rage to be

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,238
hearing about the discovery of the

6
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:36,479
double helix DNA and coding for protein

7
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:39,159
synthesis from these intertwining

8
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,599
strands of DNA this was the biggest

9
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,238
thing in biology that had happened

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,359
probably ever in my in at least in my

11
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:52,878
brief life at that time here we

12
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,878
are 45 years later is that

13
00:00:53,479 --> 00:01:01,078
right and and I have to say that the

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,840
endoc canabo system is second to done as

15
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,478
far as discoveries in biology and

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
science that have come forward since

17
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:10,478
that time there's nothing that even

18
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,199
comes close understanding cannabinoids

19
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:16,079
and the endoc canabo system is so unique

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,960
and so powerful and so underutilized in

21
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,280
medicine that I I think it's absolutely

22
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,280
uh criminal really that we're holding

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,519
back on the use of cannabis

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,560
medicines

25
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:33,039
so there are researchers at NIH and uh

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,000
who have been publishing uh papers quite

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,280
recently saying that modulating this

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,438
endoc canabo system basically can affect

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,079
almost all disease and they list them

30
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,039
and it's many many lines of diseases

31
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,519
that are noted that are affected by the

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,000
endoc canabo system including cancers

33
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,879
and so forth and so forth you know them

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,478
and we the docs that are out here in the

35
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:57,798
field doing this have actually realized

36
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:00,118
this for decades or at least many years

37
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,000
and so we're in the position of trying

38
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:06,239
to see cannabis medicines really gain a

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,159
a stronger foothold by way of more

40
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,079
research because we really need to be

41
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,479
able to do clinical studies in order to

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,879
know what is the best thing to advise

43
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:18,399
I'm going to not take too much more time

44
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:21,318
at least at the moment here except to

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,640
say I'm an MD I practice in Sebastapol

46
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:25,679
California my practice is cannabis

47
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,679
consultations I've been doing it with an

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,719
office for 15 years and unofficially for

49
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,090
about 30 5 years so I'm glad to be here

50
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:38,959
thank you for the

51
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:41,759
[Applause]

52
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,158
invitation hey uh Jean

53
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,479
tand uh also an MD uh and I guess a

54
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:51,479
reluctant

55
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:55,759
businessman uh uh I've been in this

56
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:58,799
business for 11 years uh started

57
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,878
medican uh at this point we''ve uh uh

58
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,400
evaluated over 200,000 patients over the

59
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:08,158
11 years we mean a group of doctors um

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,640
who work for the company

61
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:14,679
um I guess the comment that I want to

62
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:18,598
make is is to remark how few people are

63
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,599
here uh and to remark on the discussion

64
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:26,199
that happened prior in regard taxation I

65
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:29,359
know this is not uh uh medical talk but

66
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:32,959
I hear a lot of wow we finally made it

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:37,720
um and uh the endocannabinoid system was

68
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,598
officially discovered in 88 92 right so

69
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:42,239
uh I don't know if you know science

70
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:45,318
science moves slowly and 92 is like

71
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,680
yesterday so we've got so much to know

72
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:51,399
about how cannaboids work with the body

73
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,840
or how the endocannabinoid system works

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:58,039
itself with with the plant with the

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,840
phyto canids or with acupuncture uh this

76
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:03,359
is a new system and it's not about weed

77
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,920
anymore it's about us it's about how

78
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,280
well we can get understanding the system

79
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:11,318
and so that's really as they're

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,199
considering legalization being able to

81
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:15,958
use this planet all the time are they

82
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,439
understanding are a legislators so if

83
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,879
you can grab them and say well what

84
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,560
about the endoc cannaboid system how is

85
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,719
that going to be reflected in in your

86
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,079
new laws uh that's really what I'm

87
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,080
curious

88
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:33,638
about my name is Tracy ran I am uh the

89
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,359
CEO of a nonprofit Collective called

90
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,759
canak kids I originally got into the

91
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,080
industry when my baby was diagnosed with

92
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,600
an optic pathway Goma brain tumor I was

93
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,199
forced into the Cannabis industry it

94
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,280
wasn't something that I even really knew

95
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,720
that was happening or emerging behind

96
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,279
the scenes this was the time when

97
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,199
children weren't being talked about when

98
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,839
it came to their diagnosis and um when

99
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,840
somebody first offered cannabis as an

100
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,279
option for my then tiny little baby I

101
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,119
told them I thought they were absolutely

102
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,719
crazy and how in the world would I get

103
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,720
my baby stoned when that's what I used

104
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,800
to do in college for fun I am not an MD

105
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
I do consider myself a mom colleges now

106
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,120
after two and a half years of going

107
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,359
through this industry and chemotherapy

108
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,120
sessions and working hand inand with now

109
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,080
hundreds hundreds and hundreds of other

110
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,519
families um and through a chain of

111
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,318
events I was blessed to be put in touch

112
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,799
with some incredible people that knew a

113
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,479
lot about the medicine in the industry

114
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Aunt Zelda that's here today um was

115
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,639
originally brought to us through Ricky

116
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,478
Lake and ABY Epstein who were doing a

117
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:33,439
documentary on how canab kills cancer

118
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:36,000
and Pediatrics and through Ricky through

119
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,680
ant zeldas and through um Dr Jeffrey

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
rabar and a lot of other doctors and

121
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,120
scientists and Incredible Minds in the

122
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,759
industry my education began um my

123
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,759
husband and I are continuing to treat

124
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,199
our child who has now been considered a

125
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,720
medical miracle she was supposed to be

126
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,439
completely blind in her left eye the

127
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,960
right eye was supposed to be grossly

128
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,879
compromised and I'm here to tell you she

129
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:58,599
has perfect vision her tumor

130
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,079
was she has the kind of brain tumor that

131
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,800
isn't supposed to shrink with

132
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,000
chemotherapy it's supposed to arrest the

133
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,280
development and if you see minimal

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,598
shrinkage at best it's considered a huge

135
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,359
success and if you do see shrinkage it's

136
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:13,038
only for four to six months our daughter

137
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,759
had 95% regression of her tumor a cyst

138
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:18,759
completely disappeared and um the

139
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,439
doctors just couldn't explain it so um

140
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,520
the other the other cool fact about

141
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,719
another little thing that happened with

142
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,918
my daughter is that she suffered from

143
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,639
nine blood transfusions and four months

144
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,279
before she actually stopped chemotherapy

145
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,840
she just stopped needing them which is

146
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,359
not how the human body worked and not

147
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,879
how there wasn't anything the doctors

148
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,199
could explain except for that you know

149
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,560
what this this must be the Cannabis so

150
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,439
after realizing that this is really a

151
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,839
medicine and this is something that

152
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,439
really can help and cure and kill these

153
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,399
diseases that's how canids was born it

154
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,439
started as a secret group on Facebook

155
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,959
with now over 12200 families that um are

156
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,759
all treating their children holistically

157
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,918
using cannaboid therapy and I recognized

158
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,360
that there was a need in this industry

159
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,240
for more people that had educ and more

160
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,560
voices that could speak loudly and I can

161
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,160
speak loudly that is one thing I've been

162
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,038
gifted with is The Gift of Gab and um

163
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,439
and I I just went on a mission and now

164
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,159
we have several hundred patients that we

165
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,800
treat we are getting stories that would

166
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,120
make the hairs on your arms crawl kids

167
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,240
tumors are shrinking when they're not

168
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,199
supposed to children are are sent into P

169
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,439
paliative care and they're given no

170
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,038
chance to live and three months later

171
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,959
their cancer is gone and the doctors

172
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,038
cannot explain it we've got children who

173
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,239
are celebrating thank you we've got

174
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:34,639
children who are celebrating 30 and 45

175
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,439
days now completely seizure free since

176
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,240
their very first dose of CBD and

177
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,519
integrated in with some TCA in many

178
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,400
cases we've got PTSD patients who are

179
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:44,758
off their meds people who were taking

180
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,239
handfuls of opiates that now just don't

181
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,960
need them anymore because their pain is

182
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,478
gone Crohn's patients who are gaining

183
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,918
weight for the first time in their lives

184
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:53,878
and people with severe anti-anxiety me

185
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,758
being one of them being a cancer mom

186
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,680
that's relieving these issues it is a

187
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,720
medicine I'm here to tell you I witness

188
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,120
it every day three phone calls just

189
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,199
yesterday from parents saying my kid's

190
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,759
tumor is shrinking my child is going to

live and I am you know first and

192

foremost just honored to be up here with

193
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,279
professionals that have been doing this

194
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,759
way longer than I have and I'm very

195
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,799
excited to be a part of this industry

196
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,479
and I'm honored I feel blessed to have

197
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,158
accidentally fell fallen into this it's

198
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:25,318
it's been a blessing for us because we

199
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:27,519
do now know why God made our child sick

200
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,520
thank

201
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,399
you

202
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,639
the I I haven't had a chance to in part

203
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,799
because I was very

204
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:43,439
disturbed Mr Korea's legislation last

205
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,079
year it was awful I I sent him a letter

206
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,200
telling him it was awful and I got very

207
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,600
little uh response uh you had this one

208
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,560
gentleman sitting up here say well we

209
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,639
want to check on driving well I don't

210
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:54,439
know maybe they don't believe the

211
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,480
department of transportation that says

212
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,800
there's no increased risk from driving

213
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,920
when you've used marijuana or maybe they

214
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,399
don't believe the Food and Drug

215
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,759
Administration that says about THC

216
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,559
that's what Marinol is or trabol

217
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:09,360
prescription medication that was

218
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,399
approved by the FDA in 1985 and that has

219
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,639
the usual uh psychoactive drug uh

220
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,639
warning warning don't drive operate

221
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,919
heavy equipment or engaged in dangerous

222
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,120
activity until you determine whether or

223
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,958
not this interferes with that activity

224
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,120
pretty good advice I'm guessing that uh

225
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:29,759
all the doctors up here and any doctors

226
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,679
that are out there give that U uh advice

227
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:35,240
you had um uh the fellow from Los

228
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,559
Angeles who said Gee maybe this stuff is

229
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,639
useful in treating PTSD or attention

230
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,278
deficit disorder well Dr Tan has 200,000

231
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,360
clients I'm guessing that there's more

232
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,958
than a couple uh that have been treated

233
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,039
for attention deficit disorder and

234
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,679
post-traumatic press disorder and I know

235
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,439
that Dr hergenrather and I have seen

236
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:55,078
lots of patients but we don't have the

237
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,240
same patient population uh that medicam

238
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:00,278
does um why couldn't the state

239
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,440
legislature res schedu cannabis to

240
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:06,078
schedule two I the Iowa State Board of

241
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,640
Pharmacy rescheduled schedule 5 what

242
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,958
what are we dummies here we don't

243
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:10,399
understand that it does have a medical

244
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,799
use what they they don't have the

245
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,240
courage to take on the federal

246
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:16,439
government when the federal government

247
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,799
is you know demonstrably wrong and and

248
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,680
how about we've heard this thing about

249
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,439
well gee people don't know enough we we

250
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:25,319
need to know more I'll tell you who

251
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,480
needs to know more it's doctors do we

252
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,399
teach it in our medical schools I I know

253
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,920
they teach it a little bit at UCLA so so

254
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,399
I can't uh knock all of them but there

255
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,278
was a study that came out recently that

256
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:39,120
said 133% of medical schools teach about

257
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,879
the endoc canabo system whether any of

258
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,720
those teach about the effect that

259
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,519
cannabis has on the endocannabinoid

260
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,519
system I don't know but for my money the

261
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,320
endoc canabo system is the largest

262
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,000
neurotransmitter system in the human

263
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:56,760
body and as Dr hergenrather said it's uh

264
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
useful in treating an enormous array uh

265
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:03,519
of U uh of conditions and I I have to

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,639
admit my own uh slowness to learn I

267
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,278
guess I'm a slow learner I probably

268
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,480
heard about the medical value of

269
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,799
cannabis before anybody else in this

270
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,560
room and it's only because I'm older

271
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:18,599
than most everybody else in this room um

272
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:20,679
but it was in 1959 my father who was a

273
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,440
pharmacist and I were talking about

274
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,479
alcohol prohibition and he told me he

275
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,920
said you know in

276
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,440
1928 when I was a freshman at the

277
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,759
University of Minnesota School of

278
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,279
Pharmacy one of our assignments was to

279
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,278
make tincture of cannabis and he said

280
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:38,679
and we had to be very careful because

281
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,039
the alcohol was

282
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:44,679
illegal

283
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:47,399
wow and I looked up in his Remington's

284
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:51,078
1927 textbook of Pharmacy and there on

285
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,399
page 999 and 1,000 it tells you how to

286
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,759
make tincture of cannabis and that it's

287
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,679
useful as an anod that's an archaic word

288
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,439
for analgesic analgesia is the number

289
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,919
one reason why doctors recommend

290
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,680
cannabis today and it also I think it

291
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,679
had an archaic word for tranquilizer

292
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:11,919
like calmative so there it was it must

293
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:14,000
have taken me 15 or 20 years before I

294
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,198
was able to shed myself of the

295
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,879
propaganda and wasn't that I didn't feel

296
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:20,198
that marijuana should be legalized it

297
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:23,399
was that I didn't see how a plant could

298
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:26,120
be a medicine it took me 15 years so I'm

299
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,759
a little bit more patient when doctors

300
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,519
don't get it in 15 minutes but I I this

301
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:34,399
is not 1959 anymore I mean we have

302
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,039
20,000

303
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,240
22,000 research studies on cannabis and

304
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,360
cannabinoids that have been done in the

305
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,720
last 20 years I mean if you have a

306
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,759
doctor who doesn't understand even a

307
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,560
little bit about cannabis then you need

308
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:51,559
to get another doctor that doctor is not

309
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,518
reading medical journals I'm not talking

310
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,399
about reading High Times I'm talking

311
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,839
about reading medical journals by the

312
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,958
way High Times in

313
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,399
1975 had a cover article on the use of

314
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:04,479
cannabis as medicine and I thought oh

315
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,839
they're just pulling my leg and a couple

316
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,199
years later I thought oh no Dave you're

317
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,880
just dumb again you know somebody else

318
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:14,639
is is is ahead of the curve on this so

319
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,679
the state legislature should mandate

320
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,480
that the medical schools that you and I

321
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:23,000
are paying good tax dollars for teach

322
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:27,959
about the endoc canabo system and you

323
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,559
know we need to uh uh have regulations

324
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,799
that protect people we we need to treat

325
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,759
this like a medicine it should be tested

326
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,120
absolutely you got THC in this you got

327
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,679
CBD in this you got CBG in this what

328
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,759
tpin do you have in this what's the dose

329
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:44,319
that you're taking oh and you know it'd

330
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,958
be nice if the people read the label

331
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,959
some of you may be familiar with Marine

332
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,078
Dow who was a columnist for the New York

333
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:53,439
Times went to Colorado and uh she had a

334
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:55,239
candy bar and she took a piece of that

335
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,360
nothing happened because when you take

336
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,560
something Orly it takes 45 minutes to an

337
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,039
hour and 15 minutes so she took another

338
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,000
piece of course nothing happened she

339
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,159
waited another 15 minutes she ate the

340
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,159
whole thing oh man and she wrote this

341
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,519
colum I was miserable for 6 hours well

342
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,719
maybe if she'd had done some research uh

343
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,278
you know and read up on it uh that would

344
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,959
have been useful and I think that these

345
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:19,919
things need to be labeled I got a whole

346
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:22,198
bunch of other stuff I want to share

347
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,679
with you but I think I'll leave a little

348
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:28,799
air for the rest of the uh uh panel here

349
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,078
oh there is you know even Time Magazine

350
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:34,120
you know comes out with the highly

351
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,638
divisive curiously underfunded and

352
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,078
strangely promising world of pot science

353
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,519
and I do want to

354
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:45,319
mention these guys want to see whether

355
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:49,320
cannabis interferes with driving I have

356
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:52,040
a 100 page uh response in a legal case

357
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,160
that I put together with Paul armano

358
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,559
Paul is the deputy director of normal

359
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,159
knows more about driving under the

360
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:00,559
influence of marijuana than anybody I

361
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,838
get the big gig because I have MD after

362
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,439
my name not cuz I know something about

363
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:06,759
this and it we've got the information

364
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,959
we've got the data there how about

365
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:12,680
spending this money on seeing whether or

366
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,679
not cannabis cures cancer

367
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,240
thanks so every panelist here has seen

368
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,000
some amazing things with cannabis and as

369
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,759
Dr Berman just mentioned there are over

370
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,679
20,000 peer-reviewed studies in formal

371
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,560
medical journals about the use of

372
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:30,799
cannabis or cannaboids and their

373
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,159
efficacy against many conditions and I

374
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,958
was wondering what several of you

375
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,679
thought um some of the most informative

376
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,119
and influential articles were that

377
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:41,359
showed how and why canabo were

378
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,120
benefiting benefiting these diseases

379
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,000
either studies specifically on uh

380
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,198
specific conditions or the endoc canabo

381
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,039
system as a whole because there's a lot

382
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:52,519
of great ones out there I'd love to know

383
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:54,838
what you think I can start um this is

384
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,919
actually more of a patient doctor

385
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,000
anecdotal study that United Patients

386
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,240
Group posted recently that I found

387
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,799
extremely intriguing and I have

388
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,560
incorporated into our practice which is

389
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,958
how THC and CBD works with different

390
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,239
forms of breast cancer because there's

391
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,159
um estrogen Pro positive progesterone

392
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,680
positive

393
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:16,198
hr2 and we have found this to be true in

394
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,919
our practice with our breast cancer

395
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,719
patients as have the nurses that I've

396
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,958
worked with and it was interesting to

397
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,839
find that if you are um estrogen

398
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:27,359
positive or triple positive the THC can

399
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,160
actually influence the growth of the

400
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,399
cancer cells whereas if you do do a

401
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:34,559
higher CBD regimen you see the cancer

402
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,958
just get annihilated and I found that

403
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,479
very interesting because we all believe

404
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:41,518
THC is a cancer killer and in every kind

405
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,199
of disease outside of estrogen positive

406
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,799
and triple positive it is we are our our

407
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,599
average ratio is a 1:1 or a 2:1 and in

408
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,039
some cases even a 3 to four: one being

409
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,959
THC the highest but I found this very

410
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,838
intriguing which is you know one of the

411
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,599
reasons why I think that the science the

412
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,240
the the trials like these things have to

413
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,040
be happening now and we have to get off

414
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,519
the schedule in order to really be able

415
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,318
to study how the human body interacts

416
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,279
with these different compounds once we

417
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:09,000
introduce them into our body we've had

418
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,519
some incredible success with breast

419
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,759
cancer and and by following this

420
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,558
anecdotal doctor driven patient driven

421
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,240
um type of regimen we're seeing it

422
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:22,318
really work in these patients and I just

423
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,919
I found that so interesting when you

424
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,000
know looking at all of the other studies

425
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,439
out there and and that was the one study

426
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,960
that really kind of made us pivot a

427
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,720
little bit on how we were treating these

428
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,919
women

429
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,279
individually can you I would like to

430
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,280
it's actually it's uh if you go to

431
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,918
unitedparcelservice Israel in May and it

432
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,400
was speaking about the difference

433
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,960
between isolated CBD and CBD as a whole

434
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,640
plant extract just a quick show of hands

435
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,519
who knows about this already okay about

436
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,799
a quarter of you I'm going to just

437
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:17,639
briefly describe it when you take a

438
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,519
single molecule CBD and look at the dose

439
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,159
response it's a bell-shaped curve which

440
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,279
is to say too little and it doesn't do a

441
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,600
thing too much in it doesn't do a thing

442
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,960
but just in the right sweet spot it does

443
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,759
a lot so so this is something unique in

444
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,720
in

445
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:37,720
CBD uh well it is unique but there are

446
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,679
are are uh what I want to compare what

447
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,600
they compared it to in the Israeli study

448
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,519
is this they took a whole plant extract

449
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:48,158
of a CBD Rich medicine and it behaved as

450
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,200
a linear curve so the more you gave the

451
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,480
more effect you got this is what we have

452
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,519
in the plant and so when you isolate

453
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,200
these molecules and get out to these 99%

454
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:01,558
CBD uh extracts that's not what you want

455
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,480
you want the whole plant now I'm going

456
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,678
to move quickly on to three papers that

457
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,038
I think are valuable to for you to know

458
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,919
about one of them is the hustus paper

459
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:14,599
Marilyn hustus was published in 2007 on

460
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,000
pharmacokinetics of cannabis and this is

461
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:18,558
something that is a little out of date

462
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,159
but it's the only thing we have right

463
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,480
now and it talks about

464
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:26,400
bioavailability and the blood levels and

465
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,480
so forth uh of various forms of

466
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,400
administration of um of can Canabis so

467
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,880
what we're looking at is the differences

468
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:39,240
between the metabolism of ingested forms

469
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,440
oral Buckle exposure rectal uh use of

470
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,240
cannabinoids uh you know she goes

471
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,400
through the whole list so it's the best

472
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,720
information we have to date and I think

473
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,000
it's something that you ought to have in

474
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,960
your in your folder of uh cannabis

475
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,119
information another one is called the

476
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,000
Keel study that came out of England it

477
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:58,759
was published in about 2005 or 6 what

478
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,159
they did in England this is about

479
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,960
schizophrenia and psychosis and there's

480
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,039
still quite a push by the federal

481
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,679
government to make you feel that uh

482
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,359
we're going to cause a lot of

483
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:12,720
schizophrenia and psychosis by letting

484
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:17,119
cannabis be legalized this study went on

485
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,558
to look at about 2 and a half% of the of

486
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,158
the English population over a 10year

487
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:25,678
span in the clinic systems in Great

488
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:28,679
Britain and over that span the 18year

489
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,080
olds or younger had an 18-fold in

490
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,120
increase in the use of cannabis and

491
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:36,158
during that interval there was no

492
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:38,879
increase in schizophrenia or psychosis

493
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,080
it's an important study to be able to

494
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,000
refer to and the third one I'm I'm going

495
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:46,359
to mention for a moment here is in 2010

496
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,798
the paper by Maru and mallister and

497
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,839
others came out of San Francisco this is

498
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:54,319
a very important study in order to look

499
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:56,959
at the effects of CBD and THC on the

500
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:59,279
growth of cancer cells and and what

501
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,240
happens when you put these two molecules

502
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,480
together which is known as synergism and

503
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,240
it's quite remarkable because as they

504
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,759
increase the doses of THC they began to

505
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,640
see the cells either die off or not be

506
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,359
able to grow both with THC at a certain

507
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,559
level in the mic five micromolar range

508
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,639
and in the one micromolar range when you

509
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:22,960
give CBD similarly they had a drop in

510
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,080
the in the survival of these cells when

511
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,079
they put them together the cancer cells

512
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,558
practically could not grow at all so

513
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,439
very important when you're dealing with

514
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,759
Cancers get the ca get the canabo

515
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,558
balanced more or less exactly what Balan

516
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,440
we don't know we would love to know and

517
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:41,960
we'd love to be able to look at some

518
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,600
some clinical trials where we could

519
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,600
tease this apart more I taking off

520
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,200
from taking off from uh what Jeff had to

521
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:58,119
say when I saw Justin's uh questions my

522
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,038
response was we don't know the federal

523
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:04,000
government has systematically blocked

524
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:06,079
research yet they deny it as a matter of

525
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,839
fact I recently wrote an oped piece that

526
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,480
was published in the Seattle Times and

527
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:14,558
they denied it there their response was

528
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,640
oh we approved research for THC and CBD

529
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,480
as you just heard Dr hergen R say we're

530
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,960
not talking about isolated uh extracts

531
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,038
we're talking about the whole plant um

532
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,159
Dr Donald tashkin is an Meritus

533
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:30,038
professor of pulmonology at UCLA uh

534
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:33,120
there was an old study he did in 1975

535
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:35,839
that said cannabis is a bronco dilator

536
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:38,439
and this is why in the 1920s you had at

537
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,000
least three cigarettes on the market uh

538
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,880
that were contained cannabis and they

539
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,038
were for the treatment of asthma because

540
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,320
it's like adver it's a Bronco dilator

541
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,519
it's an anti-inflammatory tashkin is

542
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,119
more famous and an article that you

543
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:54,679
definitely should have uh was his study

544
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:59,599
in Los Angeles where he took a look at

545
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:03,360
the um Los Los Angeles County uh can

546
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,759
cancer research directory or blog and

547
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,319
had 1100 patients matched him up with

548
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:11,200
1100 people of similar age sex and

549
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,240
geographic area and he thought that he

550
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,880
was going to find that the more

551
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,159
marijuana you smoke the more likely you

552
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,960
were to get lung cancer and he's a very

553
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,559
straight shooter and what he found was

554
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,360
the more marijuana you smoke the less

555
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:24,599
likely you were to get lung

556
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:27,918
cancer uh and I mean then this guy was a

557
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:31,079
straight shooter he I he I he has a a

558
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:35,159
great deal of respect for me uh two more

559
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:37,240
quick ones uh one is not a SC uh

560
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,120
scientific study it's a clinical study

561
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,798
and it was done by Dr hergenrather on

562
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,918
Crohn's disease uh it was very extensive

563
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:45,639
questionnaire and it showed that uh

564
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,520
people with crohn's disease who were

565
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,559
using cannabis this is you know sort of

566
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,319
a skewed study for treating their

567
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:55,558
Crohn's disease had less abdominal pain

568
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,960
fewer stools better form stools uh and

569
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,079
uh many of them were able to stop using

570
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,038
steroids

571
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:02,639
which not a good thing to use on a daily

572
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,519
basis unless maybe you have Cron's

573
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,759
disease uh and then uh two more quick

574
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:11,720
ones one is a article that appeared in

575
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:14,400
the Scientific American in 2004 by eler

576
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,200
and nickel uh entitled The Brain Zone

577
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,720
marijuana and it talks about retrograde

578
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,960
inhibition which I think is very

579
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,798
important in understanding uh the role

580
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,679
of cannabis in terms of dealing with

581
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:28,519
migraines or seizures uh and uh

582
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,038
attention deficit disorder and post a

583
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,599
atic stress disorder uh and then lastly

584
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,599
there was a review article in 2008 out

585
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,798
of the University of Wisconsin that

586
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:42,398
touched on about 12 or 15 different

587
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:45,599
cancers uh in which it numerous studies

588
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:49,479
found that uh cannabis killed cancer

589
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,480
cells in tissue culture and in

590
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,359
mice uh one more article if you're

591
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,880
writing it down the care and feeding of

592
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,839
the endoc canab system highly

593
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,559
recommended it's a review article and it

594
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,839
uh brings to light that this is not

595
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,678
about the plant it's about the

596
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,558
endocannabinoid

597
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,720
system excellent and yes that article

598
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:13,960
that um Dr tal ran just mentioned talks

599
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,079
about all these other things that you

600
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,000
can do to enhance your endoc canabo

601
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,960
system like acupuncture probiotics

602
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,519
Omega-3s so there's many things that you

603
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,519
can do besides using cannabis in order

604
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,319
to strengthen your endoc canabo system

605
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,079
and make the Cannabis that you do use a

606
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,519
lot more effective and I did want to

607
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,240
throw throw in one more study that's

608
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,720
really great it's called the endoc

609
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,640
canabo system as an emerging Target of

610
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,120
pharmacotherapy which was published in

611
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,320
2006 it literally goes through how the

612
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:42,798
endoc canabo system plays a role in

613
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,000
every single major disease um so if you

614
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,200
know any any relationship it's it's

615
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,759
pretty incredible

616
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,440
um the endoc canabo system as an

617
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,879
emerging Target of pharmacotherapy by

618
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,720
pater botai and kunos um so great

619
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,440
article so although we you know we do

620
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,319
need a lot more research especially to

621
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,360
make good recommendations to patients

622
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,678
about what to use but you know in the

623
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:08,599
current environment what can you do to

624
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:10,200
make good recommendations to patients

625
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,839
and what are the most important factors

626
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,840
in making those

627
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:16,039
recommendations you guys want to go me

628
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,240
to

629
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:21,798
go I'll talk first what the what the

630
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,720
most important factors are in

631
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:26,158
recommending a catmus protocol for

632
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,440
someone and how you go about making your

633
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,159
recommendations about what they should

634
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,720
use and do

635
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,520
well for us I'm not a doctor I didn't go

636
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,679
to medal medical school I don't

637
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,158
understand drug interactions like these

638
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,480
professionals do so we have a team of

639
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,960
nurses and and doctors that we're

640
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,919
training currently that can really look

641
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,399
at what is the disease what are they

642
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,600
doing from a western medicine type of

643
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:50,798
standpoint how old are they how much do

644
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,558
they weigh and how do we need to treat

645
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,519
this patient based on their specific

646
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:58,839
disease one of the most frustrating

647
00:26:54,519 --> 00:27:01,798
things for me is this a grma day it's

648
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:03,439
just not how you should be treating

649
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:07,000
yourself when you have a serious disease

650
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,798
a gram of what no two oils are the same

651
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,880
one oil could be 40% in strength one oil

652
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:15,158
could be 75 to 85% in strength so

653
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,399
telling a patient go take a gram a day

654
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:18,799
that'll fixture cancer it's it's not how

655
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:21,519
it should be done we're we're more

656
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,200
advanced than that now um the other

657
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,079
thing that kind of frust frustrates me

658
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,519
still a little bit is this grain of rice

659
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,319
Theory the half a grain of rice the

660
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,639
grain of rice well it it's a half a

661
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,720
grain of rice to you isn't a half a

662
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,440
grain of rice to me yeah is it is it a

663
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,038
long grain is it a short grain is it you

664
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,759
know what what size is this grain so you

665
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,200
know what we have done is we've really

666
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:42,359
taken a step back and said okay how do

667
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,720
we treat these patients consistently

668
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,359
across the board especially because we

669
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,960
deal so heavily in Pediatrics the last

670
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:50,199
thing you want to do is send a child

671
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,798
into you know anxiety attack or make

672
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,038
them uncomfortable or any in any way or

673
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:55,480
make them feel worse than they already

674
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,440
feel so we start our patients out with

675
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,120
tinctures and we look at how many

676
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,798
cannaboids per milliliter or in that

677
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,719
tincture and we start them off on a

678
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:06,240
small dose as small as 5 milligrams and

679
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,839
using a tincture we can accurately weigh

680
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,960
out using a 1 gram syringe that exact

681
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:13,398
dose every single time and then we

682
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,720
slowly increase them every 3 to 5 days

683
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:18,000
now this is all specific to that disease

684
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,200
we don't treat an autistic child the

685
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,359
same way as we do an epileptic child or

686
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,640
the same way do we do as a cancer child

687
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,678
or an adult with cancer or Crohn's or

688
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,399
PTSD all of these different types of

689
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,240
disease have different things that

690
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,278
anecdotally because we're not allowed to

691
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,599
do a lot of This research have found to

692
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:37,398
be the most effective so it's about

693
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:40,079
working with a professional that

694
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:41,798
understands exactly what Pharmaceuticals

695
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,519
are being ingested into the body how

696
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:45,720
those interact with the liver enzymes

697
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,960
and the body as a whole um and what kind

698
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,798
of like epilepsy for example a lot of

699
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,120
these like ay and horrible drugs that

700
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:53,679
they put these children on can can block

701
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,199
the Cannabis and can interact with the

702
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,320
Cannabis in a very negative way so for

703
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,319
an epilepsy patient it really is is

704
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,278
quite important to have their physician

705
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:03,678
on board so that you can start to

706
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:05,359
decrease the use of those

707
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,720
Pharmaceuticals while you're increasing

708
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,839
the use of cannabis in order to make it

709
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,519
actually work otherwise the kids's just

710
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,798
going to continue to seize and then also

711
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,519
understanding the power of bringing in

712
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:17,679
something like thca which is an

713
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,120
incredible medicine that we're doing

714
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,960
more and more research on and more and

715
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,359
more studies on when it comes to our our

716
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,720
epileptic children we're finding that in

717
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,719
in many cases the CBD does a fantastic

718
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,480
job of decreasing the seizures but it's

719
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,558
not completely getting rid of them you

720
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,120
add in a little bit of thca our kids are

721
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:35,558
seizure free we've got three of them

722
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,038
right now celebrating 30 45 55 days

723
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:39,440
without a single seizure after having

724
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,960
seizures every hour on the hour and some

725
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,759
hundreds a day so it's really

726
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,200
understanding each of the diseases um

727
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,919
you know when you have a GBM for example

728
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,919
if it's been completely reected and

729
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,360
there's no tumors still there then the

730
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,120
protocol could definitely be different

731
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,678
than someone that still has a mass in

732
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,719
their brain and and the cancer is still

733
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,919
there and active it requires a higher

734
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,919
THC versus when there there's no tumor

735
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,600
present in a lot of lot of circumstances

736
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:05,278
a higher CBD with children like my

737
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,599
little girl Sophie who has an optic

738
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,278
pathway GMA we have so far seen 100%

739
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,240
success rate in getting these tumors

740
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:15,079
that don't traditionally shrink to

741
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,720
shrink using a protocol of a 1: one and

742
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:20,000
in some cases a 2:1 and we're starting

743
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,319
them around the 350 milligrams of total

744
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,119
canabo a day monitoring the scans seeing

745
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,519
if it works and keeping them there at

746
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:29,239
the lower dose versus the 500 600 700

747
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,839
milligram a day for a small child

748
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,599
because why give them more medicine if

749
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,720
they don't actually need it the

750
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,879
challenge that we have with cancer is

751
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,240
that these kids aren't getting scans

752
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,000
every few weeks they're getting scans

753
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,599
every two and a half months so we're

754
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,240
really having to stick with the protocol

755
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,079
for a certain amount of time seeing how

756
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,599
it works adjust and then continue the

757
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:49,918
treatment but understanding the science

758
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,678
of it and what their oncologists are

759
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,840
doing or their neurosurgeons are doing

760
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,399
or neurologists are doing is very very

761
00:30:53,839 --> 00:31:00,398
important when also introducing

762
00:30:55,398 --> 00:31:00,398
cannaboid therapy into the body that's

763
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:07,319
awesome um we adjust doses uh depending

764
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:09,558
on per patient so even with blood

765
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:11,519
pressure medicine uh you're going to

766
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:14,440
give start at a dose and then you're

767
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,679
going to adjust it over time uh and one

768
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,798
person might react well to 10 milligrams

769
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:22,519
of lenil and one person might not react

770
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:25,638
well at all so there's still variability

771
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:28,240
from person to person but the dosing how

772
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:32,479
do we dose in medicine uh it's very

773
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,960
simple milligrams per kilogram of body

774
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,798
weight so milligrams of what are you

775
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,319
using THC CBD uh beta caropine what are

776
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:44,759
you using what's in the plant that

777
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:46,200
you're using have your medicine analyzed

778
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,319
then you'll know how many milligrams

779
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,000
you're taking on a regular basis and how

780
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:53,119
what's your body weight because a big

781
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,079
person may metabolized differently than

782
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:58,518
the smaller person especially important

783
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:00,798
in the kids uh so really simple things

784
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,638
understand variability from person to

785
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,200
person and we're trying to standardize

786
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:07,558
with milligrams per

787
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,480
kilogram I would add to that to say that

788
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:13,398
uh somewhere in this range of a half a

789
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,639
milligram per kilogram per day is a a

790
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:17,918
decent starting point for many

791
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:21,278
situations and I would also add that

792
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,600
tailoring the dose for any individual is

793
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,919
is what it's all about and when I hear

794
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,359
Justin's question I'm kind of thinking

795
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,720
how much time do we have

796
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:33,638
this is what I do initially certainly at

797
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,519
the first visit and follow-up visits as

798
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:37,839
well because it's awful lot of it is

799
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,079
about figuring out what's going on with

800
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:44,000
this person and how how they need to

801
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,519
best utilize the medicine so for example

802
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,200
if it's an adult who's picking up the

803
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,240
grandkids at 3:00 at school that's going

804
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,519
to play into the treatment plan as far

805
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,240
as what kind of shape they're going to

806
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,839
be in after after they're dosing so many

807
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,839
times we're going to dose a higher dose

808
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,759
at bedtime for serious medical

809
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:02,879
conditions uh often we're going to try

810
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,240
to get two or three doses in per day

811
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,278
this is orally I'm speaking of because

812
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,960
of the fact that orally ingested

813
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:12,759
cannabinoid oils or tinctures of any

814
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,038
kind or products of any kind have a

815
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:17,798
metabolism over the course of about 5 to

816
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:19,638
10 hours generally and we do have

817
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:23,599
genetic variations not only in our

818
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:26,439
genome to code for this cytochrome p450

819
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,278
metabolic pathway not everybody is the

820
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,840
same and in many people it's quite

821
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:32,839
different so we really have to look at

822
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,798
an individual's response in order to

823
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:37,879
know what kind of a dose they can

824
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,879
tolerate another factor that was kind of

825
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,799
alluded to was drug drug interactions

826
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,519
and this is a a a big deal but not a big

827
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:49,918
deal it's a big deal because uh well

828
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:53,079
it's not a big deal because over the use

829
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,480
of satex coming out of uh Great Britain

830
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:59,720
a 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD roughly a

831
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,120
couple milligrams of E in an oral spray

832
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,759
they have then had these patients using

833
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:07,678
the satex sprayed orally five 10 times a

834
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,800
day is more or less what they're using

835
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,280
it in 30,000 patient years and Dr Russo

836
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,480
who was the medical director there said

837
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,760
this probably more like 40,000 patient

838
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,760
years of experience there have been no

839
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,520
discontinuation of drugs of the of the

840
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,960
satx because of a drug drug

841
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:29,599
interaction that is to say even though

842
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,320
some uh some Pharmaceuticals such as

843
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,679
anti-convulsants a couple different

844
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,960
anticonvulsants are metabolized by the

845
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,240
same metabolic pathway as the THC and

846
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,358
CBD it's not a worry because probably

847
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,319
the dose of cannabinoids is small enough

848
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:46,918
to where it does not have a significant

849
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,200
impact in altering the blood levels of

850
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,199
these anti-convulsants now on the other

851
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,719
hand a kid that might be on

852
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:56,678
anticonvulsants that's the kid who you

853
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:58,679
really have to be careful with because a

854
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,200
you could run into a drug drug

855
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:04,759
interaction and and the the quantity of

856
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:07,559
of or the concentration of the the

857
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,320
anticonvulsant may change significantly

858
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:11,719
if they're on a very high dose of

859
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,880
cannabis oils such as in a cancer

860
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:15,879
therapy which in a kid with a brain

861
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,480
tumor they may very well be on an

862
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,200
anticonvulsant as well but accepting

863
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,559
that it just generally isn't a

864
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:26,399
problem um I I I think it go back to the

865
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,279
question that I asked in one of the

866
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,240
previous uh panels

867
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,880
is we need to treat cannabis like a

868
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:36,838
medicine and that's what Dr Tan and Dr

869
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,400
hergen rther said uh there is uh an

870
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:41,559
individual adjustment that you make with

871
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,119
most patients on most medicines so why

872
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:46,039
should it be any different for for

873
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,920
cannabis I also need to admit my

874
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:51,318
ignorance here's a a wheel that shows

875
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,920
CBD CBN

876
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:57,920
CBC I really don't have a clue as to

877
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,960
what the the appropriate uh amount

878
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,480
percentages of them that's why we need

879
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,358
to have more research now uh GW

880
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,599
Pharmaceuticals is doing some of that

881
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:09,440
research but that's just uh the tip of

882
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:13,119
the iceberg now what I have used in

883
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:15,920
terms of determining dose is uh

884
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:19,039
dronabinol uh which is THC I mentioned

885
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,000
that um before and what I found is is

886
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:24,599
that relatively low doses of THC like 2

887
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,079
and A2 milligrams one to three times a

888
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,920
day is good for most people who have

889
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:34,800
attention deficit disorder who have

890
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:38,358
anxiety 5 to 10 milligrams of THC is uh

891
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,079
good for uh helping people sleep I had

892
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:42,559
uh treated a woman who had multiple

893
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,960
sclerosis and then she fell and tripped

894
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:47,719
and um fractured her uh shoulder and she

895
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,880
said doc the 10 milligrams didn't do

896
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:52,480
anything uh but when I went to 15

897
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,519
milligrams it got rid of the pain so

898
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,079
then I started prescribing 15 to 20

899
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,960
milligrams and what I found was I got a

900
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,000
lot of complaints about the side effects

901
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,960
about

902
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,519
dysphoria uh and you need to be careful

903
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,199
of that and that's that's why the whole

904
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:10,679
plant as was mentioned earlier uh is uh

905
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:14,078
is is so important I had a patient that

906
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:16,799
came in about two three weeks ago uh and

907
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,240
he had uh I believe he had pain and so

908
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,720
they took an edible and I said now try

909
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:25,279
to get a one to1 THC to CBD so they did

910
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:27,799
and I get a call and said the guy

911
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,480
hallucinated well how much did he take

912
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:36,240
30 milligrams and and then I said listen

913
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:38,880
to yourself Dave is CBD partially blocks

914
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:41,439
the Euphoria caused by THC and I don't

915
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,838
know what that partially blocks means

916
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,240
but let's say for a minute that it

917
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,920
blocks 30% of the Euphoria so this guy

918
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:52,399
had the equivalent of 20 milligrams of

919
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,440
THC I can understand why for some people

920
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,079
uh it would be unpleasant and cause

921
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,800
dysphoria so you know you need to take a

922
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:01,680
look at the side effect profile you need

923
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,640
to take a look at uh uh prescription

924
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,719
drugs in which there are recommended

925
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:08,279
doses and they've tested it on animals

926
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:11,118
and people and you need to listen to

927
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,560
your patience I mean everybody's

928
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,760
different and I've learned more from my

929
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:16,719
patience and I can uh possibly thank

930
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,079
them

931
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:24,759
for excellent a little yes of

932
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:27,640
course I wanted to um recognize that

933
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:30,359
what Tracy Ryan had said a minute ago

934
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:32,679
regarding not oils not all oils are the

935
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:34,598
same this is something that you I become

936
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:36,799
very aware of in in Consulting with

937
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:39,240
people by phone across the country for

938
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,000
example a fellow uh said Gee I took the

939
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,118
oil and you know increased the dose and

940
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,559
I'm still not feeling it and so they

941
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,119
finally on advice went ahead and had it

942
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:49,960
analyzed and the amount of canabo in the

943
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,480
oil was something around

944
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,440
12% uh that's not what we get out here

945
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:59,280
generally speaking so when you get these

946
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,599
oils that are 30 to 80 5% cannabinoids

947
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,200
you've got something much more potent

948
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,440
another element of this is how much CBD

949
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:09,480
is in there and the more CBD it really

950
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,599
offsets the psychoactivity significantly

951
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,599
and one of my patients brought back to

952
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,160
me some followup about treating cancer

953
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:20,440
an a poorly treated Myoma multiple Myoma

954
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:22,960
patient and I sent him home in

955
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,960
recommending that he up you know

956
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,039
increases dose gradually over the course

957
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,000
of a few weeks and when he came back he

958
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:32,920
said well I got home and said fooy and

959
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,358
he took the whole gram of oil just at

960
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,039
one time and was um pretty pretty

961
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:39,480
knocked out and he and his wife kind of

962
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:42,079
chuckled and he said yeah you were kind

963
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,880
of a lump on the couch for five

964
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,960
days he continued to take the grham of

965
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,358
oil a day by the way he was determined

966
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,039
so he kept taking it on the fifth day he

967
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,960
got up and started acting normally

968
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:56,880
again the point is tolerance is our

969
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,000
friend in this situation it really

970
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,838
develops rapidly when we use high doses

971
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,920
of cannabinoids and it may not be five

972
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,838
days for everybody but generally over

973
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,440
that course of about a week you see a

974
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:10,358
great deal of Tolerance developed and

975
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,480
people should you know be cautioned

976
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:15,199
about a variety of things including a

977
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,358
fall risk and it's going to maybe affect

978
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,439
their blood pressure and so so forth

979
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:20,920
when they're using high doses of oil but

980
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,880
eventually they're going to become

981
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,838
tolerant of it and be able to take high

982
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,720
doses which may be necessary in some

983
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,358
conditions particularly some really

984
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:32,639
difficult tumors my concern Jeff is is

985
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:34,920
downregulating the system the endocan

986
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:37,639
one says if you take too much like Rick

987
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,720
Rick Simpson Oil procedure maybe you're

988
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:42,879
doing harm because you're downregulating

989
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:45,199
your system so what's The Sweet Spot you

990
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,640
know uh we definitely have to be aware

991
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,639
of that yeah and I agree with that

992
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:49,838
completely because I I've got patients

993
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:51,879
that come to me and they're like we're

994
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:54,318
on 2,000 milligrams I'm like are you

995
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,240
crazy why would you ever take 2,000

996
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,880
milligrams but some of these kids have

997
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,519
diseases like dip G which is in the

998
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,358
brain stem which there's hardly any

999
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:04,280
receptors at all and with cannabis we're

1000
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:05,719
not seeing shrinkage in the brain stem

1001
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,480
we're seeing stabilization so they're

1002
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:09,879
thinking if I just keep giving more more

1003
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,240
more maybe at some point I'm going to

1004
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,519
start to see some shrinkage but there

1005
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,358
are just some situations and this is one

1006
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,519
individualized situation where we're

1007
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,960
seeing stabilization and not you know

1008
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:23,159
apoptosis or or cell death um so it's

1009
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,920
really about finding that sweet spot and

1010
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:27,480
and you know like Dr bman said listening

1011
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,800
to your patients or listening to your

1012
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,440
body if it if you are the patient and

1013
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,079
working up slowly we we usually um

1014
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,119
advise our patients to go up and dose

1015
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,480
every 3 to 5 days when once that

1016
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:40,119
psychoactivity starts to kind of

1017
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,880
mitigate itself so that they can build

1018
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:45,960
that tolerance easily and the the mass

1019
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,318
majority say 90 97 98% of our kids get

1020
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,599
to a point where they don't feel it at

1021
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:51,480
all anymore my my child's going to be

1022
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,400
three next weekend and you would never

1023
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,679
know that she is on cannabis at all she

1024
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,240
is wild so which is a great thing

1025
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:00,799
considering she she's on chemotherapy

1026
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,479
like she's a normal happy healthy

1027
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,160
functioning chubby little baby and and

1028
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,519
she loves life and she's kicking the

1029
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:10,199
shit out of cancer pardon my French no

1030
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:15,000
need to apologize for

1031
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:17,480
that my question is um I guess the not

1032
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,039
sure what the proper word is um cannabis

1033
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:23,318
potentiating the effects of chemo

1034
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:25,318
possibly and sort of how that works if

1035
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:27,759
maybe asking your doctors

1036
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:33,039
for um

1037
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:35,599
a trial dose or I fully aware cannabis

1038
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:37,639
helps throughout through chemo but are

1039
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,039
there instances

1040
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:43,879
where um maybe cannabis allows the chemo

1041
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:46,318
to work more I guess that's my question

1042
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,200
absolutely synergistic yeah there is a

1043
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:52,558
synergistic effect with to Taz olamide

1044
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:54,879
one of the Cancer drugs and canabo

1045
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:59,480
that's been seen in a study that's out

1046
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,800
there uh it's not un commmon for gasta

1047
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,039
and other that's exactly what I'm

1048
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,318
talking about conditions where over a

1049
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,558
course of a few months the effect of

1050
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:10,358
temol amide is wanes so it looks like

1051
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,880
it's helpful initially and then it

1052
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:15,318
disappears if canabo are brought in at

1053
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,440
least in this study that was published

1054
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:21,759
uh not too long ago temozolomide seem to

1055
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,079
regain its Edge as the canabo were added

1056
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,440
so there is a synergism with the with

1057
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,839
the canabo and the and the chemotherapy

1058
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,280
as far as the chemotherapy in general I

1059
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:32,960
I don't think there's much question that

1060
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,800
the docks out there even the square

1061
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,119
docks that have never done this before

1062
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,440
are recognizing that here the Cannabis

1063
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,240
patients are coming in and they've

1064
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,358
gained weight during chemotherapy and

1065
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,639
they're feeling great and in many cases

1066
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:46,719
it really mitigates the symptoms

1067
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,118
significantly absolutely my daughter's

1068
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:51,000
on temodar right now so she's on temodar

1069
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,480
and Vin Christine and carop platin and

1070
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,239
again this is where I always go back to

1071
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,880
these optic pathway gomas and this is

1072
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,118
one of the reasons why I want to do

1073
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,480
everything in my power to raise money to

1074
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:02,400
do a trial that's that's privately

1075
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,920
funded on these specific tumors because

1076
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,280
these are tumors that the doctors told

1077
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,079
us this is not going to shrink your

1078
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,040
kids's going to go blind chemo is not

1079
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,318
going to make it smaller um it's going

1080
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:13,880
to arrest the development of it if we

1081
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:16,318
see a little bit of shrinkage it'll be

1082
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,599
considered a huge success 95% shrinkage

1083
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,239
you yes the chemo is working with the

1084
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:22,800
Cannabis in this situation and all of

1085
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,838
her doctors are now again doctors who

1086
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,440
had no idea that cannabis was even in

1087
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:27,558
the medical books or it even been talked

1088
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,679
about they had no re research on it

1089
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,920
whatsoever like Dr BMA was saying before

1090
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,039
they know now and now all of these other

1091
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,280
children that have these lowgrade gomas

1092
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:37,639
that don't traditionally work with

1093
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,119
chemotherapy these tumors are shrinking

1094
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:42,480
like crazy I've got one dad who

1095
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:44,358
contacted me yesterday another scan same

1096
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,480
same type of tumor OPG tumor is

1097
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:48,598
shrinking even more the radiologist

1098
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,039
actually called the oncologist and said

1099
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:51,800
what new clinical trial do you have this

1100
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:53,440
little girl on where you're getting her

1101
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,880
tumor to shrink this much and the

1102
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,079
doctor's like she's she's on Vin

1103
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,599
Christine and carop platin and the the

1104
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:00,440
radiologist is like I can't explain this

1105
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,920
I can't understand how it continues to

1106
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,280
keep shrinking month after month after

1107
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,240
month so absolutely it it absolutely int

1108
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,079
and uh um makes the chemo work harder

1109
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,279
and stronger and penetrates those cell

1110
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,839
deeper to to cause more cell death I've

1111
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:17,559
got a story to share with you at a

1112
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:20,239
cocktail party in February and this uh

1113
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:24,160
fellows late 20s early 30s said my

1114
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:26,399
stepfather has uh cancer the throat the

1115
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,480
metastasized to the regional lymph node

1116
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,440
the rib and the liver and the doctors

1117
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,159
say he's going to die what do you know

1118
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,679
about Simpson Oil Well I don't know too

1119
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,679
much about Simpson Oil Dr heran rther

1120
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:38,759
and really knows about that but I told

1121
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:41,199
him what little I knew and didn't think

1122
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,200
much of it and early June he calls me up

1123
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:47,239
and said uh last CAT scan showed my

1124
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:50,879
stepfather is cured and he came into my

1125
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:52,399
office a couple weeks later and uh uh

1126
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,480
yeah they should they couldn't find any

1127
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,960
they did another CAT scan and found a

1128
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,119
little bit of cancer at the base of his

1129
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,720
tongue oh they did give him chemo along

1130
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:01,599
with the this and so now they're going

1131
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:03,039
to give him chemo but not for pation

1132
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,079
they're going to give him treatment for

1133
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:09,440
cure uh and

1134
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,880
so the problem goes back to what I think

1135
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,960
all of us have touched on is you need to

1136
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:18,760
have some research to really answer this

1137
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,559
question on the other hand Dr Abrams has

1138
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,559
nailed it when he said there's more than

1139
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,119
enough basic science evidence and the

1140
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,640
anecdotal reports to justify doing

1141
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,559
double blind studies and everybody in

1142
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:31,000
this room should write the White House

1143
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:32,920
and say when are you going to start the

1144
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,159
double blind studies that are federally

1145
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,159
funded for the treatment of

1146
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:41,119
cancer

1147
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:43,480
[Music]

1148
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,000
um I have a question I have a client who

1149
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,480
called me a while ago and said that she

1150
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,639
wanted to inject the cannabis oil into

1151
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,079
the tuor in her breast and I was like

1152
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:55,199
okay and then a couple months later I

1153
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:58,920
read an article that that was actually

1154
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:01,399
happening so can you any of you address

1155
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,599
that the truth of that is that someone I

1156
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,599
mean I was like I'm not going to tell

1157
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,000
you yes or no to do that that's out of

1158
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:11,640
my practice but the only known uh

1159
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,119
injection I am aware of is Manuel Guzman

1160
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:19,199
infusing THC into into the GBM brain

1161
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:21,240
tumors in in Madrid and otherwise I am

1162
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:24,118
not aware of anybody injecting cannabis

1163
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:27,078
oil into tumors sounds risky on the

1164
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:31,000
other hand when you when you talk about

1165
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:33,720
uh breast cancer uh Dr McAllister uh up

1166
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,480
in San Francisco is doing a doubleblind

1167
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:38,598
study with cannabis for treatment of

1168
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,318
breast cancer and I think all of us uh

1169
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:44,200
up here are aware of breast cancer

1170
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:46,079
patients uh whose cancer has either gone

1171
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:47,799
into remission or be cured depending

1172
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:51,400
upon you know what terminology you want

1173
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:54,480
to use from uh oral uh

1174
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,480
ingestion uh it's speculative as to

1175
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,039
whether injecting it would be worthwhile

1176
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,358
but uh it's certainly something that be

1177
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:05,759
worth doing research on what uh

1178
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:09,598
mallister previously did a study on mice

1179
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:11,520
uh and I think they injected uh uh the

1180
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,359
material whatever their their subject

1181
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,920
material was I don't know if it was from

1182
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:19,759
Cannabis or THC or CBD into the parital

1183
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,960
cavity and uh it cured the mouse's

1184
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,119
breast cancer they didn't inject it into

1185
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:28,559
into the tumor they injected it into the

1186
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:31,440
mouse so we know that you're we can car

1187
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,440
your Mouse's breast

1188
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:38,280
cancer I'm curious about the the

1189
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:41,480
resistance among Physicians to accepting

1190
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,000
that it uh that medical Mor R is a fact

1191
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,400
of life and whether you think that uh

1192
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,599
perhaps one cause is this persistent

1193
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,160
belief that it is either a gateway drug

1194
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:53,720
to addiction or addictive itself and

1195
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:56,960
also the prevalence of uh of addiction

1196
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:59,318
programs and therapists who combine it

1197
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,519
with all with opiates and alcohol

1198
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:03,358
addiction and all of those and and and

1199
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,759
what the solution to that is whether

1200
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:10,480
that is an obstacle to Greater

1201
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:12,319
acceptance of it and is that then is the

1202
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,280
solution to that the education of

1203
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:17,920
Physicians and uh pure pressure to get

1204
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,079
past that I think that's a biggest part

1205
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,200
of it would be education the other part

1206
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,720
of it is to stop the federal government

1207
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:26,519
wasting money on on vilifying and

1208
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:30,558
misleading the public about what's going

1209
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:34,159
on one that's ondcp that's FDA that's

1210
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:36,720
NIH that's ni naida and FDA are all

1211
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:38,639
involved FDA probably the least but

1212
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,558
they're all involved in in the

1213
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:43,000
misinformation that continues to come

1214
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,798
out in order to protect the Ved interest

1215
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,159
you see that among your I see that among

1216
00:49:45,798 --> 00:49:50,318
my colleagues but I'm also the

1217
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:52,679
demographic of all of this is changing

1218
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,279
those docs that never referred a patient

1219
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:56,759
before and I hadn't heard from them for

1220
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,720
20 years are now sending patients so

1221
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,440
over a local oncologist who had never

1222
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,798
seen a result with cannabis saw a GBM

1223
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,760
disappear so things are happening and

1224
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:07,679
they're you know we're at the oh whoo

1225
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,000
stage with some of these docks and it's

1226
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,279
really nice to be able to see this but

1227
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,880
as long as the feds are vilifying it the

1228
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,480
majority of doctors are not going to

1229
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,599
feel comfortable getting involved in

1230
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,000
this we do have to work on both the

1231
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,880
education Medical School side of it we

1232
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,519
can't

1233
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,200
legislate medical schools teaching

1234
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:28,000
cannabinoid medicine we that's what I'm

1235
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:31,039
told by the legislators in my question

1236
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,079
today so we have to put P pressure on

1237
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:36,279
every medical school in the in the land

1238
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,000
that's been go ahead no that's been my

1239
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,359
experience with the doctors that I've

1240
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,639
worked with and that our patients have

1241
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:41,960
been with is that you know you go in

1242
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:43,318
initially and they have no idea what

1243
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,240
you're talking about and then they see

1244
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:47,199
something miraculous happen and they

1245
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:49,078
start to go H you know what maybe maybe

1246
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,239
there is something to this and my

1247
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:54,599
daughter's been treated at Kaiser Sunset

1248
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:57,000
she's now at chla um we've collaborated

1249
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:58,480
with doctors at chock hospital and none

1250
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,559
of these people really understood what

1251
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,119
was going on with her and her case and

1252
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,519
many of our other kids cases that are

1253
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:05,920
also treated at these same hospitals but

1254
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:07,960
they started to see this this

1255
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,400
spontaneous regression if you will in a

1256
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,679
tumor that clearly wasn't spontaneous

1257
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,798
spontaneously regressing and more and

1258
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:16,558
more oncologists now are sending us

1259
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:20,039
patients we're working with five major

1260
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,798
hospitals right now um holistic doctors

1261
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:23,960
acupuncturists they're they're seeing

1262
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:27,159
the Miracles and they cannot they can't

1263
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:30,318
deny it we had a a boy 16 years old with

1264
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:32,679
relapsed osteosarcoma 22 tumors in his

1265
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:34,798
bones came in in a neck brace he was on

1266
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:36,598
Percocet oxycoton and vicin and every

1267
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:38,480
day just to get out of bed and they had

1268
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:40,318
him on a paliative chemo only to help

1269
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,960
with pain I'm here to tell you within

1270
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,199
two weeks on our cannabis oil he was

1271
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,400
completely pharmaceutical free and

1272
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:49,759
within 90 days he was cancer free and

1273
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,838
that doctor has now said thank you that

1274
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,319
doctor has now said I'm a Believer I

1275
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:55,480
want to start sending you patients and

1276
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:57,558
if if AJ is still cancer free in the

1277
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,838
next two months when he gets his next

1278
00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:59,880
next scan I'm going to work with Dr

1279
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:02,159
Ronnie Goldstein and we're going to

1280
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,358
publish this to Medical journals so it's

1281
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:06,558
happening yeah I I think that you're

1282
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:11,199
you're going to

1283
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:13,839
see um as we have younger doctors who at

1284
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:17,000
least are familiar with the recre use of

1285
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:20,798
cannabis are greater willingness to read

1286
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,880
about this and to accept what they read

1287
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:26,519
I had a uh orthopedic surgeon write me a

1288
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,240
letter and I the the papers in Santa bar

1289
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:31,838
bar the weekly is very liberal and the

1290
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:36,078
daily is a Libertarian thing and so they

1291
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:37,440
both love what I write uh and uh he said

1292
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,760
why don't you talk about the side

1293
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,920
effects of marijuana in your oped pieces

1294
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,240
I said cuz there's only 800 words that

1295
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,358
they allow me here but if you think I

1296
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:50,000
don't know anything about it I sent him

1297
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:52,239
a chapter from my book oh he also carbon

1298
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,838
copied the paper cuz he thought he was

1299
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:57,919
being so clever and I carbon copied the

1300
00:52:54,838 --> 00:53:01,440
paper too cuz I knew I was being clever

1301
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:05,838
uh and uh they didn't publish his uh his

1302
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:08,798
his letter uh I think the more you have

1303
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:11,318
doctors like uh like Dr hergenrather and

1304
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:14,519
myself who are willing to speak out and

1305
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:17,400
stick our necks out you begin to have

1306
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:19,679
people in the community who know us and

1307
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,960
say Well they're not nuts on other

1308
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:22,759
things maybe they really know what

1309
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,880
they're talking about you know and and

1310
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:28,119
you begin to see these changes but you

1311
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,480
know I mean takes years and years and

1312
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:31,680
one of the other things I noticed in

1313
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,559
Santa Barbara is that there have been

1314
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,519
two or three presentations uh at the

1315
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,079
local

1316
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:40,400
hospital uh one two of them by a couple

1317
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:43,318
of residents and the other by the Doctor

1318
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,680
Who's second in charge of uh continuing

1319
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:48,679
education and that's what you need to do

1320
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:51,399
I mean we we're getting to have more

1321
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:54,519
certification for category one

1322
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:58,400
CME and I I think one of the most

1323
00:53:54,519 --> 00:54:00,440
effective things for getting do s to uh

1324
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,798
recognize this is what Tracy has talked

1325
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:06,838
about is the patient telling the doctor

1326
00:54:03,798 --> 00:54:09,318
this stuff works this stuff works and I

1327
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:13,159
should mention there's there's a online

1328
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:14,798
program that uh um Deborah Mala uh

1329
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:18,000
worked on and I provided a little

1330
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:20,280
assistance uh through the uh what's it

1331
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,559
called Cannabis Institute of medicine

1332
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:25,960
and it's it's 12 1H hour continuing CME

1333
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:28,000
things or you can give your doctor a

1334
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,920
present of my

1335
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,119
book unfortunately we have to wrap

1336
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,119
things

1337
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,318
up
