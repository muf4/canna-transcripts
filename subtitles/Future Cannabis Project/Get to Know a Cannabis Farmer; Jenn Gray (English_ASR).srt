[Music]

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:26,070
I've been growing since I was 16 years

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:28,589
old so it's been 12 years now and well I

4
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,179
mean my dad taught me how to grow from

5
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:33,000
the beginning and since then things have

6
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:38,488
changed a lot but I guess he just taught

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,070
me the techniques and Mura taught me to

8
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:44,578
respect the land and that we want to you

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,850
know increase or better the property and

10
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,100
better our home instead of just using it

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,640
up and using it for our business it's

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,920
more for you know I guess he just taught

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,500
me to respect where we're from and where

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,270
we live my farm is called Elysian Fields

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:07,530
and I live on a fifty acre piece of

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,810
property that we grow all seeds right

17
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,049
now from that have been developed by our

18
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,269
neighbors who are old-school growers so

19
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,250
they all grow really well and they're a

20
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,959
lot there's a lot of pineapple and what

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,140
we're growing I don't know if that

22
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,289
particular trait works really well where

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,560
we are or what the deal is with that but

24
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:30,960
we grow mostly I think fruitier stuff

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,570
more on the sativa side for me works

26
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,519
better the more indica has the fat buds

27
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:38,758
and we get especially in the fall we get

28
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,798
more of a coastal fog and that can

29
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,868
create mold and bud rot so for us more

30
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,490
of more on the sativa side of things

31
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:46,019
works a lot better so we grow a

32
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:47,819
pineapple OG something called pineapple

33
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:49,798
OG that's been developed by one of our

34
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,289
neighbors and then we also grow a sour

35
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,200
pineapple also developed by a neighbor

36
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,899
and I think at our farm we're growing

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,430
mostly sour pineapple and there's

38
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,228
actually a few different phenotypes of

39
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,240
that one there's a purple one and then

40
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:04,859
there's a more on the indica side and

41
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,319
more on the sativa side and my favorite

42
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,659
one is the more it's a TV one come out

43
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,929
really frosty really good smell good

44
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:11,929
yield

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,000
pretty much mostly but we're trying now

46
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:19,560
to Fino hunt and find our favorite ones

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,780
and we've been taking cuttings of all of

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,269
our favorite plants and just keep our

49
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,489
own genetics going but knowing the

50
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,920
biggest one of the biggest issues for us

51
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,810
right now is testing and knowing that

52
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,878
we're getting a clean start so there's

53
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,098
been you know people have used gnarly

54
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,108
chemicals on their clones and that will

55
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,539
that can last in the plant for a really

56
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:40,950
long time like generations so we have

57
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:42,358
been taking cuttings of our own and

58
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:43,828
we're trying to save our own genetics

59
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:45,989
and make sure that we have a really

60
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,980
clean start so we know everything that

61
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,590
happens to the plant throughout its

62
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,030
whole life my favorite strain I don't

63
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,799
smoke that much so I would have to say

64
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,789
right now Ringo's gift is my favorite

65
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:58,829
because it's a high CBD describe the

66
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:04,798
growth are you growing in the ground are

67
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:07,439
you growing in pots or native so we're

68
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,450
doing a mix this year we got a tractor I

69
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:12,479
got my first loan ever and got a tractor

70
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:15,530
and we ripped the native soil first and

71
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,768
then we put out mounds of organic

72
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,979
composted

73
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:22,919
this guy out in Chico makes worm casting

74
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,870
compost and we're just put out mounds of

75
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,849
that on top of the native soil and we

76
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,819
only used about a hundred gallons per

77
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,518
plant and usually we'd have like 200 to

78
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:34,348
400 gallon pots so we're just using 100

79
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,699
gallons per plant and then it they

80
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,348
especially because they're from seed

81
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:38,669
they have a tap root that goes down and

82
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:39,628
they're able to just keep on going

83
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:42,799
through the native soil and they're

84
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:42,798
responding really well to that

85
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:54,310
we actually had a 500 a few 500-gallon

86
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:57,039
ones last year - yeah so not pots just

87
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,620
mounts so we ripped the ground and then

88
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,560
we put laid mounds out on top of that so

89
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,539
the plants can just keep on growing and

90
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,969
you know they're about seven feet on

91
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:08,259
center and we used to be more like ten

92
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:09,939
feet on center because we wanted to have

93
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:12,009
the biggest plant possible because we

94
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:14,500
were only allowed 25 and now we're

95
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:20,048
allowed a square footage so we have like

96
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:21,519
a hundred and a hundred and seventy

97
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:23,620
probably at our house and that's not

98
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,549
even filling up the whole square footage

99
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,139
of what we're allowed but yeah we're

100
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,829
moving more towards building our own

101
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:34,750
soils and we want to have we're planning

102
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:37,659
on getting a compost pile like a big

103
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,569
load of manure put down so we can build

104
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,890
a compost pile of our own soil and cuz

105
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:43,329
that's a whole nother thing buying soil

106
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,009
you don't know what's in there you don't

107
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:46,389
know there could be stuff that comes in

108
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:48,579
through the plant and then that'll show

109
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,779
up in testing at the end so we're trying

110
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,279
to just get to a point where we know

111
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:53,199
exactly what's happening to plant the

112
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,779
whole life so we're there's no surprises

113
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,420
so what are some of the issues with

114
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:00,250
growing in the ground versus like you

115
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,189
grew it one way in the pots for a long

116
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,029
time tell me about the experience of now

117
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:07,728
growing

118
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:11,269
well so actually I've had one patch for

119
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:13,519
five years or so that was in the ground

120
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:16,339
holes that I dug out in the ground they

121
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,680
were like five feet across and it was a

122
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:20,899
great spot for a long time and then I

123
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,389
thought I had russets one year cuz one

124
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:24,528
plant just died and it just like dried

125
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,300
up at the end I thought it would just

126
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:29,629
finish out but it just dried up and died

127
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,430
and then the next year I noticed in more

128
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,110
plants and it wasn't rust it's what it

129
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,500
turned out to be was some sort of soil

130
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,150
borne fungus maybe Fusarium or something

131
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,278
like that so it was just killing plants

132
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:42,468
so that can be an issue and if you have

133
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:43,788
once you have that it's really difficult

134
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,528
to get rid of it like we talked to an

135
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:47,209
agronomist and they said just don't grow

136
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:51,319
there anymore so that can be one of the

137
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:52,818
issues rodents is an issue they if even

138
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,750
if they don't eat the roots they just

139
00:05:52,819 --> 00:06:00,098
tunnel through and can affect them those

140
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,098
are the two biggest issues I would say

141
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,588
well it hasn't happened yet we use a lot

142
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,899
of teas mostly like we haven't really

143
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:11,838
been feeding much we don't use any

144
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:14,359
bottled nutrients anymore we're doing

145
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:19,009
all compost teas and maybe some

146
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:21,740
micronized feedings but that's it

147
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,750
we actually just bought a five or a four

148
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,699
hundred gallon tank that we can just put

149
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,189
in the bed of our truck and we have a

150
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:30,439
pump that we can attach to a generator

151
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:32,449
just plug in so we can move it from

152
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:36,169
patch to patch because we have we have

153
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:38,569
two different farms and at our house we

154
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:40,838
have two different garden sites in one

155
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,838
farm

156
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,680
is it the collective model or is it

157
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:51,480
different no so their main thing is

158
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,850
distribution and so they they came up to

159
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,819
Mendocino County and met some farmers up

160
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,340
there and realized that they wanted to

161
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:02,189
be kind of part of that or promote that

162
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:04,829
so they have been working with sun-grown

163
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:07,230
farmers that are all organic and they

164
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:08,490
have been there the only distribution

165
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,220
that I've worked with that has been

166
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,290
really consistent and has been promoting

167
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,750
us as the farmers who've been here

168
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,750
forever you know trying to make our way

169
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:26,069
so they do they do a lot of wholesale

170
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:28,229
right now but they have jars and when

171
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:30,420
they put your product in a jar they say

172
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,670
where it was grown and then they put a

173
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,259
tag on it with your farm name and

174
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,420
explain a little bit like just a little

175
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,490
blurb about your farm so they the

176
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,680
biggest branding is flow camp and then

177
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,900
your

178
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,000
yeah so for me it's a model that makes

179
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:45,829
sense as a small farmer how am I

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,978
supposed to go out and brand myself when

181
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:50,629
I'm trying to grow the best product I

182
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:53,478
can't I don't have time I work all day

183
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:56,180
long from sunup to sundown or even past

184
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:59,839
sundown sometimes I'm working on my farm

185
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,129
trying to grow cannabis so I can't I

186
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,560
don't have the time I also don't have

187
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:05,180
the funds to go out and brand myself as

188
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,189
an individual farm I also don't have the

189
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,829
product there's not I don't have enough

190
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:11,870
to if I had a huge demand to make it

191
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:15,709
make sense it to me it just doesn't

192
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:17,120
really make sense so having this the

193
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:18,739
double I think what is the white label

194
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,399
branding is that what it's called yeah

195
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,400
that makes sense

196
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:38,610
