[Music]

2
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:18,109
so I had a question I kind of like to

3
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,028
ask these guys what they think about

4
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:23,179
this what do you what do you guys think

5
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:26,750
about the significance of the DEA given

6
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:28,459
GW schedule five for CBD but it's still

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:32,599
schedule one for everybody else in the

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:36,340
world what that's weird to me and I just

9
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:36,339
wanted to get your thoughts on that

10
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:45,979
it's amazing what money can do in this

11
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:48,350
country so you know I think without

12
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:50,628
getting to down to it if we want to have

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,850
a viable industry and continue to grow

14
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:54,858
we need to support industry trade

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,239
associations like NCI a and C CIA

16
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:58,698
because the pharmaceutical Lobby is

17
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,988
massive and I don't think they would be

18
00:00:58,698 --> 00:01:02,149
heartbroken if they could figure out a

19
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:04,159
way when federal rescheduling comes to

20
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,730
pull as much of this away from us as

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,289
possible

22
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,420
and they're only one of many industries

23
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,490
that is lobbying actively and could

24
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,820
benefit from you know being able to have

25
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:15,560
this but the the the timing also you

26
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:18,289
know it the timing of everything was

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,060
interesting right the declassification

28
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,400
came you know within weeks of the farm

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,079
bill and you know there's there's a lot

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,079
of public comment that yet to be had but

31
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:29,179
we'll see where the chips fall

32
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:32,269
so GW is done a lot through the industry

33
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,740
and trying to where they made some of

34
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:36,408
the isolates and such but they also

35
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:38,239
started off with full spectrum and the

36
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:40,880
enormous amount of information as far as

37
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,289
going back through the ratio of I think

38
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,759
it was a hundred and forty four

39
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,280
different initial components they were

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,659
looking at for the ratio of amount of

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,430
each one but the ratio to each other

42
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,049
even some of the minor terpenoids and

43
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,149
the fight halls and the alkaloids that

44
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:57,700
are in there I think the second part

45
00:01:53,149 --> 00:02:00,799
that becomes from that is is my biggest

46
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,689
struggle is not having the American

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,729
universities universities the United

48
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:07,368
States being able to do the research and

49
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:10,348
so that's part of the problem where they

50
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:13,419
had the forty nine different

51
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:15,929
applications for other universities

52
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:19,208
being able to supply the the different

53
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,480
cannabinoids for for medical research so

54
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:25,269
University so Mississippi State add that

55
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,798
but they but it's not their fault on the

56
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:28,420
fact that they only had two varieties

57
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:31,719
they were able to use that was

58
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:34,750
determined by the DEA and NIDA and so

59
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:36,098
dr. Rizzoli was always I need more we

60
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,479
need to be looking at more varieties and

61
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:39,399
they would he would always be rebuffed

62
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:41,259
on you know you can't have more and so

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,640
finally he got 14 more I think three

64
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:45,729
years ago and then they started adding

65
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,589
more material for him to use but it's

66
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:49,810
also the other universities he got

67
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,189
Cornell you got UC Davis I don't want to

68
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,229
leave someone out Colorado State now

69
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,878
that I'm on a roll but all these other

70
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:57,310
ones that are there the University of

71
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,628
Vermont I'm on a roll now and so you go

72
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,120
back through these these places that are

73
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:03,818
that are agricultural centers that we've

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,099
used throughout our history of being

75
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:07,839
able to have the boundaries so whether

76
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:09,009
it's good boundaries or boundaries we

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,598
still need to know what the boundaries

78
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:12,969
are for each one of these cannabinoid

79
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:15,668
mixtures what else is in the terpenes

80
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:17,229
what else is in the alkaloids here's the

81
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:18,760
question for you what's in the roots

82
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:20,138
because we're not using the roots right

83
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,789
now if we grind up the roots there's

84
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:23,590
some minor trace alkaloids that have

85
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:25,418
shown some capability as anti fungal

86
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,189
that's typically where everything starts

87
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:28,719
we typically eat a lot of roots we eat

88
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:30,250
potatoes we eat carrots we eat a lot of

89
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,189
things from the ground and that's why we

90
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,750
eat them so the other one is is what

91
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:36,939
happens when you start to have different

92
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,919
varieties that that are able to be used

93
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:41,199
with other species there's some

94
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,359
preliminary work that if you have the

95
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,340
cannabinoids you have the the cannabis

96
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:47,980
plant and you plant it between different

97
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,180
types of species they grow monster and

98
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,909
you put us through some of the other

99
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,400
ones in there and they're stunted so

100
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:55,959
there's some communal work that has to

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,769
be done that the AG schools the

102
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,598
universities and so I'm an American okay

103
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,949
so at the same time I'm I'm not

104
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,418
prejudiced by the fact that we have

105
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:06,459
great universities but right now we're

106
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:08,109
getting we're not getting the research

107
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:09,699
done that's being done in Spain that's

108
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:13,599
being done in Colombia that's being done

109
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:14,709
in Uruguay that's being done in Israel

110
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,168
Canada

111
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,848
you got McGill now you've got Guelph you

112
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:21,218
got beasts you have all these places

113
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:22,810
that the universities in the in the

114
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,990
United States could really benefit from

115
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,449
the

116
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:31,590
and the next generation so Fritz and I

117
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:31,590
are okay you guys got a few years left

118
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:37,000
but at the same time we have these young

119
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,649
people that want getting their pH D's

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,180
that are sitting there 30s that they

121
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:41,978
were aching to get into it but they

122
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,449
can't there's no universities they're

123
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:45,909
gonna that are going to be able to

124
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,710
compromise their grants to be able to do

125
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,169
this and so that's that's what it is

126
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:52,239
it's it's a private research that's

127
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:53,589
happening it's a little tangential but I

128
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,889
think it's also really important to note

129
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:59,109
that a lot of anecdotal evidence and

130
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,538
experience for cannabis is from the full

131
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,300
spectrum of everything that that plant

132
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:05,829
has to offer and you know with

133
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,629
rescheduling it gets a little murky

134
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:10,258
because the FDA doesn't have the best

135
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:13,120
track record for wanting to authorize

136
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,530
multi compound multi chemical compounds

137
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,019
right they like it simple they want one

138
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:18,758
chemical compound maybe two but you know

139
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:20,258
getting into different ratios terpene

140
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,788
blends you know it's it's highly

141
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,050
unlikely that those products will ever

142
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,418
see the light of day given the current

143
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,788
structuring of the FDA if it moves into

144
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:31,569
a federal medical classification and

145
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:32,978
that's why it's you know it's it's much

146
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:35,019
more enjoyable from the consumers

147
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:37,300
perspective to smoke all those things

148
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:39,218
but also from a medical perspective you

149
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,408
know there's a lot going on that medical

150
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:44,079
cannabis offers that the pharmaceutical

151
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:48,939
industry just won't just inherently and

152
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:52,060
how its structured also throw in I guess

153
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:55,418
I'm a little fixated on this but it's

154
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:58,658
apart from the DEA giving GW schedule

155
00:05:55,418 --> 00:06:01,930
five the FDA gave them an NDI number a

156
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:04,779
new dietary ingredient number four CBD

157
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,699
so that really I'm knowing a lot about

158
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:09,459
the natural products industry that means

159
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,199
that it's kind of like a patent the GW

160
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:14,649
doesn't have to enforce themselves the

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:23,590
FDA will enforce that for them so it's

162
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:25,299
all to use CBD as I don't know exactly

163
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:28,239
where we're you know where the

164
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,069
boundaries are but an NDI number is is

165
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,379
that's what that means it's a new

166
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:36,060
dietary ingredient it's like it's like

167
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:36,060
GW discovered a new

168
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:42,069
so if you look at the so I always I

169
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:44,740
always study every morning so I I did

170
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,908
look at some of the newer patents by GW

171
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,658
any other companies and now they're

172
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:53,379
doing it as a single component but also

173
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:55,300
can be used in a botanical dietary

174
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,249
nutritional supplement so that's a new

175
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,079
little clause that they're adding at the

176
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:01,150
end of some of the patent work that

177
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:06,508
they're doing so if you look at the FDA

178
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:09,698
guidelines from December 2016 it's the

179
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,919
it's a natural it's a dietary supplement

180
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,800
so natural products and dietary

181
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,149
supplements guidelines so if you see the

182
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,588
guidelines that goes through with

183
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:19,149
anything that you have to do with any

184
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:22,629
natural products it doesn't matter if

185
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:24,459
it's cohosh Saint John's wort it doesn't

186
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:26,379
matter vitamin E it doesn't matter what

187
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:28,239
they are you still have to be able to

188
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:31,509
show that you're you're growing a crop

189
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,509
that in three crops gave the same

190
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:35,979
relative amount of that variety that you

191
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:37,778
were expecting then so you have good

192
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:39,338
agricultural practices you have good

193
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:41,408
manufacturing practices you have good

194
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:42,759
laboratory practices so those are all

195
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:44,168
the guidelines and all you have to

196
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,588
really do is take that plat one

197
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:49,939
guideline and just add cannabis into it

198
00:07:47,588 --> 00:08:01,499
and then all the guidelines are done

199
00:07:49,939 --> 00:08:01,499
