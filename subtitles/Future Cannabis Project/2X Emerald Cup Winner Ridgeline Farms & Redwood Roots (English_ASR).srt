1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,140
in 3 2 1

2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:17,310
we are live ok thank you for joining us

3
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,980
everyone we have here we go

4
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:25,018
Kevin Joey is entering the room Chris

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:28,829
Anderson is entering the room and that

6
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,329
is me Peter so very so Jason what we

7
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,939
were talking about earlier is kind of

8
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:37,280
like can you talk about the evolution of

9
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:39,628
kind of your grows and your gross style

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,239
from like when you first started growing

11
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:45,599
I assume it was not at a commercial

12
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:48,390
legal commercial scale so was it was it

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,070
in the garage was it outdoors was it up

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:57,030
in the Humboldt area was it outdoors it

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:01,649
was in the mountains you know we call

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:05,489
them grill it grows you know he did hike

17
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,890
bags of dirt chicken shit whatnot up and

18
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,920
down mountains and you know item as good

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,890
as we could and you know it was like

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,240
that for four years and then eventually

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:22,019
we started moving indoors I mean the

22
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:24,810
evolution is kind of started at a slower

23
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:28,048
speed and it's just sped up to a whole

24
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:35,400
different world now I mean it see

25
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:38,368
everything that's going on yeah you know

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,259
I was really young I was I started

27
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:43,259
working you know it's still be grown I'd

28
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,509
be growing really grows with my dad and

29
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,569
you know patches out in the middle of

30
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,450
nowhere and you know doing construction

31
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:54,359
with him for a while and it eventually

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:58,259
moved on to just work in big indoor

33
00:01:54,359 --> 00:02:01,649
scenes and you know learn how to grow

34
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,319
both both ways you know the technology

35
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,739
wasn't there so you know we weren't

36
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,598
doing testing and we didn't know near

37
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:12,000
the science we just you know we were

38
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,709
taught from our parents and we knew I'd

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,848
agree oh no we

40
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:20,239
to grow the plant and uh you know when

41
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:23,218
you have Kevin here because I mean a guy

42
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,049
his brain works there mean he knows so

43
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:30,479
much more on on this you know all the

44
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:33,269
descriptions organisms and all that but

45
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:38,098
yeah we sit there and I could tell how

46
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:41,039
to plant as you know I just always kind

47
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:45,828
of fed it the same I'm a ball go to fed

48
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:48,030
it but I know how to go intuitive

49
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:51,569
intuitive yeah you basically learned

50
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,878
with your dad right and and was this in

51
00:02:51,568 --> 00:03:01,500
like the 80s the I mean you don't look

52
00:02:53,878 --> 00:03:03,598
that old well I'm 40 yeah I definitely

53
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,639
remember you know starting to work with

54
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,408
him when I was around you know eight

55
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:13,849
probably you know I was probably picking

56
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:16,590
leaves and I was about six you know so

57
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:18,439
yeah I was really young and you know it

58
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,479
was a whole different world we were

59
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:23,459
super freaked out just because you know

60
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:27,120
we did a camp flying over a house

61
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,340
multiple times and landing at her house

62
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,019
coming in our house we dealt with all of

63
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,509
that I've already you know told these

64
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,489
stories a lot and you know it's kind of

65
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:37,620
I really love to talk about it as much

66
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:41,969
anymore is good to let the story out at

67
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:45,658
first and now now we're kind of past

68
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:49,680
that we've you know we went from doing

69
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:53,568
these you know just just back down like

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:57,209
said we'd grow you know 10 to 20 pounds

71
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:59,098
sell it for four to five thousand

72
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,620
dollars and you know we were really

73
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:04,168
really we were really poor family back

74
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,359
then but life was just great so if we

75
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:09,479
didn't need thousands of pounds

76
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,799
we just we needed just just what we

77
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,769
could live on it was a whole different

78
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,228
type of growing you talked a little bit

79
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,658
about that what you were growing back

80
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:21,949
then what types of cultivars and strains

81
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:25,740
and how that's of all oh my gosh I mean

82
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:28,649
Tod we call it you know your pop we go

83
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,110
seed we we

84
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:33,568
we had seeds from friends every

85
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,479
neighbors we all traded seeds it wasn't

86
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:39,889
there wasn't so many strains I mean and

87
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,750
as we know a lot of these strains have

88
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,668
there's been one strain you know crossed

89
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,370
a thousand times now there's just so

90
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:51,658
many strains it's crazy to watch happen

91
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:53,970
even when I was in my teens growing you

92
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:57,329
know indoors there is still probably

93
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:00,330
four or five strains and you know that

94
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:02,728
that's evolved just it's it's amazing to

95
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:05,250
watch it and it's it's exciting honestly

96
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:07,589
I mean for me I love the plant I love

97
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,490
growing right now I'm growing seven

98
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:12,959
strains and six green or seven strains

99
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,939
and six greenhouses that I've actually

100
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,339
never even grown before up ten strains

101
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,689
six greenhouses and seven of them I

102
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,959
don't even know exactly what they're

103
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:24,750
gonna do I've seen the final product

104
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,370
through other people but you know it's

105
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,728
really exciting to see because there's

106
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,129
just amazing you know there's these

107
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:35,968
people out here what do they call it

108
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:37,439
Kevin just the genetic the people are

109
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:41,490
you know all these there's lots of

110
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:43,889
people like you know growing up stuff

111
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,658
let's say see junkie right now and

112
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:50,460
lemonade and you know there's all these

113
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:54,509
that they're incredible there's and you

114
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:57,089
know so you know the evolution of the

115
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:59,158
strains changing is just crazy to me

116
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,810
it's it's how do you decide what you're

117
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:04,110
gonna grow do you take what's available

118
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:08,218
are you making proactive choices like

119
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:10,020
this year well let's say this year I

120
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:11,759
mean I'm sticking with stuff that I know

121
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,799
people will like I mean the Green

122
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:20,759
Lantern seemed to be really good it's a

123
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:23,250
very very potent strain seems to be this

124
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,139
day and age people really like hi Katie

125
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,569
that's like what they're going for they

126
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:31,590
I want to see these numbers from 25 you

127
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:33,389
know personally it's not what I love but

128
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:36,060
that's what they really like out there

129
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:39,810
Green Lantern is a very special strain

130
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,129
because it floors you it's doesn't have

131
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,459
tons of flavor

132
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,259
it gassy and grown and cured perfectly

133
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:50,668
because it does have like you knows

134
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:52,739
about half of G in it but uh these other

135
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:55,769
strains you know let's say like runts

136
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:57,899
it's a very popular strain but its taste

137
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:59,788
amazing and I mean when I smoke it as

138
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,918
lots of like the purple Urkel's like

139
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:05,248
flavor that was one of my favorites um

140
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:08,488
back in the day um what's the cherry

141
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:09,028
what's a cherry one Kevin give you out

142
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:11,188
on there

143
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:13,110
what's that you look at cherry pie yeah

144
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:15,389
the cherry pie the cherry pies in lots

145
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,598
of these and I was one of my like you

146
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:21,478
know so I'm kind of going with I always

147
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,968
will grow no G because I love to gassy

148
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:27,990
oh geez I love that just the dominant

149
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:29,939
indica it's it's I say Oh G is queen I

150
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,889
mean that's what you say it's it's all

151
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:35,189
these people always love oh gee I love

152
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:37,889
our G but I do love flavors I have this

153
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:40,079
uh so I'm citrus I'm growing and it

154
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,168
tastes like an orange it's a very

155
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,689
citrusy flavor I did notice you know

156
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:48,299
let's say normal club last year a lot of

157
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:50,849
the flavors that talked you know that

158
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:56,069
we're up there in the talk were were

159
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:58,528
more exotics and you know so it's it's

160
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:00,809
weird certain places I mean as we know

161
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:02,728
it you know East Coast loves the gassy

162
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:04,709
flavors they love the Sour Diesel they

163
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:06,808
love the oh geez I mean I mean that's

164
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:09,149
just coming from a producer person that

165
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:10,649
produces marijuana you could use know

166
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:13,559
where it goes and that's what they love

167
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:17,129
but it seems like it's turning into more

168
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:20,879
of a exotic type of like out there and a

169
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:22,919
high THC so between both of those you

170
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:27,599
know I look and see what the public

171
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:30,508
really likes what I what I like just

172
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:33,028
kind of roll the dice on a lot of it and

173
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,860
hope that it you know I don't know you

174
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:37,168
kind of learn a strain I could tell oh

175
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,629
gee exactly when I flip it how big it's

176
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:41,519
gonna get I know what to feed it I know

177
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:44,068
everything about it so when you pick a

178
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,959
new strain it's a whole different thing

179
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:47,729
you have to pick you know you don't know

180
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,578
when you flip it if it's gonna let say

181
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,159
skittles one year do that I flipped it

182
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:54,629
it grew one inch and then sorry buddy

183
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,879
they were tiny

184
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:59,850
you know let's say the runts you flip it

185
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,070
it'll grow it'll double its size so you

186
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,920
kinda have to learn strains it is risky

187
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:08,040
to switch and grow a bunch of different

188
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:11,729
strains but I really like the variety

189
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:14,189
I like having um I know I'm growing

190
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,379
great strains because like I said the

191
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,000
people that made new genetics I mean

192
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:19,379
they're crushing it and so I'm not

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,539
really worried about it being good I

194
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:23,399
know I could do the quality I mean I'm

195
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:25,259
hard not super worried about either so

196
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,750
you put that together and it should be

197
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,389
fun and it makes it way more interesting

198
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:33,870
than growing all oh gee I did that for

199
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:35,519
last not last few of you before probably

200
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,340
four or five years in a row just all oh

201
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,340
geez so that's a people wanted cool

202
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,990
beautiful plants love it but you know we

203
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,620
need more we need like you say I believe

204
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:49,110
we need to fall for me I'm in girl weed

205
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,909
like I said it's really like really

206
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:55,370
grown weed since I was probably about 12

207
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:57,959
and so the excitement in it for me is

208
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,730
definitely seeing new strains brand new

209
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,100
strains of getting the feedback from the

210
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,050
consumers and I mean that's what it's

211
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,990
about that's really what I was hoping to

212
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:09,329
talk about a lot on this is we really

213
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:13,750
need to educate the consumers and that's

214
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:18,370
that's you know that comes from

215
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:20,049
you know the dispensaries Chris redwood

216
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,000
roots you know people going out there

217
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:26,889
and getting are about they're telling

218
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,870
our stories knowing where the herbs that

219
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:30,490
they are buying comes from where that

220
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,560
money that you know who they're

221
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,990
supporting what they're putting in their

222
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,209
bodies you know all of that comes back

223
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,820
to educating the consumer and if we all

224
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:42,790
work together like podcasts like this

225
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:45,520
you know and get the word out and let

226
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:49,089
them know you know they they buy it from

227
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,970
a family-run farm or you know we support

228
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,410
a small community basically they help

229
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,820
support a whole village and I mean

230
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:56,649
that's really what's happening you know

231
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,790
and that's what keeps our little town

232
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:02,740
going yeah I I think I mean you're

233
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:04,569
talking about education and I think it's

234
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,870
interesting that you you do have to

235
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:12,490
balance kind of growing hype strains

236
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:14,830
versus maybe stuff that you and your dad

237
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,529
grew or your neighbors grew that you

238
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,210
really loved but doesn't have the

239
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:21,179
hightlight like when Chris has to go

240
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:25,450
down Chris were you just down in LA

241
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:27,519
think he's on the 405 right now I'm

242
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,820
actually I just hit the valley down on

243
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,710
the five I just came down the grapevine

244
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,140
you're in those you're in SoCal right

245
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:38,110
now so like in terms of when you're

246
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:40,629
interacting with shops and bud tenders

247
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,879
and owners and purchasing decision

248
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:48,009
makers you know telling the story of

249
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:52,870
something that's not a hype strain but

250
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:55,480
that jason has been growing or any of

251
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:59,710
your other farms have been growing for

252
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:02,110
decades and as you think is amazing but

253
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,700
the kind of general public is like

254
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,480
that's not the hype strain that I'm

255
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,460
looking for

256
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,279
they just haven't smoked it yet but yeah

257
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,660
I'm actually not currently our major

258
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:20,470
focus is on moving a lot of bulk product

259
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:22,990
we are not servicing a whole lot of

260
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,180
dispensaries at this point in time we've

261
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,950
kind of regrouped and and honed in our

262
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:30,699
whole strategy on this

263
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:32,530
you should too instead of you had a

264
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,240
vision of covering all the bases and

265
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:36,339
full vertical integration and all the

266
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,019
whole nine yards and I still feel like

267
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:42,340
that is something that's out in the

268
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:44,860
future potentially however we've we've

269
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,740
really honed our whole process in

270
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,649
business and financial model into first

271
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,669
mile distribution and procurement and

272
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,529
and delivering that product to other

273
00:12:53,669 --> 00:13:00,189
brands and distributors across the state

274
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:02,409
more more so than retail at this point

275
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:06,780
we are redirecting a whole lot of our

276
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:10,179
energy here in the next 2 3 4 5 6 months

277
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:12,250
back to the brand and retail and getting

278
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:14,739
shelf space and and having those

279
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:18,490
conversations with bud tenders and

280
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:21,039
buyers and and and that education that

281
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:26,350
Jason speaks of is absolutely over

282
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:31,120
important but how do you get the mass

283
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:33,220
consumer base to swap up the fluff and

284
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,100
the vapor of all these designer strains

285
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:39,460
which are chronic crucial I like smoking

286
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,980
all of them - for sure I just like P o T

287
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,509
ha what's wrong with that you know

288
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,430
whatever happened to the posturing I

289
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:48,549
love the evolution I love all the

290
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:53,769
genetics the evolution to me is is is

291
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:56,709
more based on medicine and the evolution

292
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:58,569
of genetics and and breeding and and the

293
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,750
unknown medicines that can be unlocked

294
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:04,090
in that evolution is super crucial of

295
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,480
course we all like the flavors and the

296
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:09,610
high and and the terpene profiles and

297
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,460
all that stuff work you know I think

298
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:15,480
most we all what we all enjoy all of

299
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,250
that stuff however I did see the

300
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,830
evolution of cannabis and the medicine

301
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,509
part is what gets me really excited and

302
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,580
I'm obviously not a doctor or a

303
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:26,230
scientist but there are doctors and

304
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,470
scientists out there pushing the

305
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:34,120
envelope and you know so that that's

306
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:35,950
exciting to me so I I want to do we got

307
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,480
what I like about this is we have plenty

308
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,070
of time to dive into some of these

309
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,399
topics so I don't have to gloss over

310
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,769
them

311
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,950
I want to get into kind of the evolution

312
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:47,959
of each of your like the many pivots and

313
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,278
twists and turns you've taken and kind

314
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,599
of your current line of thinking but

315
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:54,620
let's sit let's stick with kind of

316
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,570
cultivation and stuff like that Jason

317
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:01,250
give me an example of something that you

318
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,899
like to smoke that you don't see out on

319
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:09,500
the market or think that people

320
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:12,889
necessarily appreciate I'm Chris or

321
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,659
Kevin her well my dad has the seed

322
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:18,049
strand he's working on for a while it's

323
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:20,480
called Supergirl and I mean it it's it's

324
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:21,979
amazing it's completely pretty much done

325
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,810
by September

326
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:29,180
I mean buds are giant which you know

327

349
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,310
I mean it's purple it's amazing but it

350
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,278
tastes okay get a little flavor then

351
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:37,250
it's gone the highs okay but yeah you

352
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:39,679
know my dad has some seeds that you know

353
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,509
we pop and we actually he grows a few

354
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,799
plants so it's all rather smoked some of

355
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,708
that than some of these other strains

356
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,879
because it just tastes great looks not

357
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,708
quite there but yeah it's called

358
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,629
Supergirl maybe one day we'll have to

359
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:53,779
bring it out

360
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:55,159
talk about your your because when we're

361
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,139
talking before you were talking about

362
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:59,509
playing with some new products since

363
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:02,720
then specifically roots organic and so

364
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:05,088
can you talk about your setup like you

365
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,828
said you have seven greenhouses are UN

366
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:13,069
pots or you and raised beds or you time

367
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:16,639
in raised beds I mean I love growing

368
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:19,309
organically I have changed so many times

369
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,259
and anyone around here that says they've

370
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:25,250
only grown organic is pretty much full

371
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:27,319
of crap I mean when we were younger we

372
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:31,250
didn't know shit you know we put

373
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:33,139
Osmocote on the bottom of it they the

374
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,329
ground in the middle of nowhere with

375
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,100
drip lines I didn't know I use bro more

376
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:40,309
you know I'm at least two literally dip

377
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:42,469
our hands in avid like we didn't know

378
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:45,919
any of this stuff from your younger and

379
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:48,019
so I would do that evolution of just

380
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,160
using whatever I was taught for years

381
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:51,440
GHP

382
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,750
you know lots of different stuff I mean

383
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,160
it wasn't good I'm not gonna but when

384
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,569
you don't know any of this you're

385
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,150
younger you're just trying to produce

386
00:17:56,569 --> 00:18:01,519
and get a certain amount of yield and

387
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,019
you know for your boss and make everyone

388
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,420
happy you're just listening to people

389
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:07,220
that's what you do as you learned you

390
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,810
know and I mean obviously my dad wasn't

391
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,110
happy with any of that that's for damn

392
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,419
sure but uh as we evolved you know I

393
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:17,299
definitely started going back and do

394
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,400
I've always the raised beds or pots you

395
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:21,589
know I have planted you know auger holes

396
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,960
right into the ground but you know we

397
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:25,189
just use you know the usual the worm the

398
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,130
chicken shit

399
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:31,580
you know the basics lots of bat and

400
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:33,980
stuff like that and you know you know

401
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:36,619
I'll tell you right now is if you say

402
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,880
you know everything and growing then you

403
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:40,909
know then you're never gonna

404
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,530
you're never gonna aren't gonna move on

405
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,730
here can you get better what you do and

406
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:48,589
I've always listened I learned and

407
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:52,250
advice from other people and in this

408
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:56,439
industry it changes so much growing but

409
00:18:52,250 --> 00:19:00,049
the knowledge has changed so much and

410
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,789
this year what I'm doing you know last

411
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:04,009
year we tried certain things you know

412
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:06,589
and and I liked it it worked

413
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,750
good but I have some friends that you

414
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:10,849
know we were childhood friends roommate

415
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,679
baby just quickly can you talk about

416
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:17,889
some of the things you tried last year

417
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:20,840
and kind of what I use a lot of MOCA use

418
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,270
doctor hurts and chicken shit and phone

419
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:25,970
real and I'm saying into my dirt I'm n

420
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:28,579
my beds really tough with all kinds of

421
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:31,279
great nutrients so my bands have enough

422
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:33,829
stuff and I my first work honestly I

423
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,579
probably barely need to feed it but then

424
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:38,869
I start powering on all kinds of

425
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:41,210
organics you know last year I did try

426
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:45,469
some new stuff with green grow and tried

427
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:48,259
some of their products I had a I got

428
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,058
really lucky I had a really good friend

429
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:53,298
I fish with Oh have a good friend it

430
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:56,269
fish with that that is a tea guru and

431
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:58,730
last year is my first year to really

432
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:59,480
learn how to do tea which I still don't

433
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,630
know shit

434
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:07,099
honestly I'm not number 10 like I did

435
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:09,080
but I know what to put in because what

436
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:11,449
he told me because I listen but I know

437
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:15,220
what to put in you know and in these tea

438
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:17,900
and they brew tea for the whole run and

439
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:22,370
so talk about kind of some of the things

440
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:24,500
he tried to drill into your head in my

441
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:26,569
head it's basically how long you breathe

442
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,269
key it's what you put in the tea

443
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:31,759
everything you put in take somes 24

444
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:34,009
hours some 32 hours I mean it goes on

445
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,308
and on it's the amount I mean people

446
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:39,410
right there's tons of books on this

447
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:42,109
probably I mean I'm just saying it's

448
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:46,100
evolving there's too much for me to

449
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:49,399
learn in a year so he he gave me his

450
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:52,699
recipe and that was mostly for the

451
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,280
grouse stage so I use that my plants

452
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,470
grew they look like celery they grew so

453
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:02,509
fast my starts that were in five inch

454
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:04,160
pots were I mean it was like I mean they

455
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:05,089
grew like bean pulls away I've never

456
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,679
seen nothing like it

457
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:09,409
I was really excited and then when it

458
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,179
came to the bloom stage he didn't really

459
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,100
give me that so then I had to start

460
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:14,870
digging I started going with some green

461
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:17,839
grow I started going some root stuff

462
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:20,899
they have this turkeys and this

463
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,278
bounty bounty makes teas and sigh sorry

464
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,548
I mean you could go in the stores and he

465
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:28,788
can buy premade teas for a lot of money

466
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:32,629
or you could buy just you know the right

467
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:37,369
ingredients I spent $200 and I still

468
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:39,500
have stuff from that and at the end of

469
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:42,558
last year I could tell you right now my

470
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:46,009
yields were down and my quality was up

471
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:49,730
so I mean you you could smoke and I was

472
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:51,558
told this from a few the judges you

473
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,960
could smoke the joint all the way down

474
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:57,230
to the bottom of the roach and it still

475
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:00,288
tasted good and I I think that was from

476
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,028
the tea honestly and so now this year

477
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:04,158
what I was trying to do is like I was

478
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:06,710
saying with the roots is these are two

479
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,649
really good long time old friends I've

480
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,538
known them my whole life

481
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:14,089
you know they're their new gene Oregon

482
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:16,339
they're in a whole different area and I

483
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:18,918
remember them coming here cuz they had a

484
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:20,178
gross tour is mostly like a fish store

485
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,409
back then

486
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:26,210
and so they came here probably 12 to 15

487
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:28,880
years ago and they sat down and they

488
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,240
were just tripping on all the weed grown

489
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,890
here and just how this you know are

490
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,679
basically canvas culture we live in and

491
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:38,870
I was we were thriving and they won't

492
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:41,570
you know they're excited about it and so

493
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:43,699
to me it was really special about it

494
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,230
we all went all the way around and we

495
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,759
met right here and said let's work

496
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:50,839
together why are we not working together

497
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:52,940
and so one of my best friends which he's

498
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:56,089
like one of the main guys he produces

499
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,679
their products he is a genius he talks

500
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:58,808
to me and I don't understand half the

501
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,679
stuff you saying

502
00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:06,168
but basically helping me with this

503
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:08,809
organic recipes and you know I'm using a

504
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:10,640
lot of their products around it is I

505
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:13,190
mean it's fun for me it's a whole new

506
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,919
thing I've new strains of new product

507
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:19,730
and you know that's a lot when you know

508
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:22,070
what you do you know how to do it and I

509
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,788
know I'd be fine doing what I've been

510
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:27,349
doing for the last ten years

511
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:28,640
you know I say that because I've

512
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:30,918
switched so many times the last ten

513
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,580
years I'm just drawing with you know the

514
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,490
regular

515
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:37,000
greedy incised it's a lot to really do

516
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,930
that in trust and other people

517
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,250
especially when I have some of the eyes

518
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:45,980
on me to to grow really quality product

519
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:48,380
so but anyways so now I'm doing a whole

520
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,329
new different feeding regimen I'm using

521
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,490
the same dirt I'm adding a lot of the

522
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:54,230
same stuff to the dirt and I'm used it

523
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,440
doing a lot these a lot of new strains

524
00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:00,319
and it's besides out and he said

525
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,000
intuition of knowing okay well my plant

526
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,649
looks like there's too much nitrogen in

527
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,259
it you know I could I could tell that

528
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,570
before I sent off to him to the lab

529
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:11,599
because when I read tests we've never

530
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:14,269
never tested my weed once I never tested

531
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:17,389
my dirt it all just started happening

532
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:20,000
now you know we didn't test for THC we

533
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:23,870
smoke the weed you got really high high

534
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,630
THC you know it wasn't it's just one of

535
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:28,309
these things like coming from me and I

536
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,410
mean I can see you know Kevin and Chris

537
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:33,769
it's like this is our life we've been

538
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:35,570
doing this our whole life so you know

539
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:39,889
people were ahead of us on the indoor

540
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:40,069
game like that you know co2 and this and

541
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,890
that

542
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:46,039
yes yeah - we had big old diamond lights

543
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:49,580
you know we you know big old bulbs and

544
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:52,970
it did we're behind the technology but

545
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:54,769
we all its inner it's our heritage it's

546
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:57,350
what we've been doing we know how to

547
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:59,960
grow we know the plant so we don't even

548
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:02,480
need all that technology you know so we

549
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,110
get actually we're so lucky that I can I

550
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,069
could skip around and I can grow other

551
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:11,629
food that I personally know is good and

552
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:13,970
do it in the same way that I've kind of

553
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,140
been doing it and I have a feeling it's

554
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,589
the turn out good and I mean right now

555
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:21,140
my crops look amazing I mean I've stocks

556
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:23,029
that are giant which sometimes sometimes

557
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,770
scare me because the Giants stock at a

558
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:27,019
depth plant isn't always the biggest but

559
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:29,889
right now it's starting to stack and

560
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:33,369
everything is looking really really good

561
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:36,410
yeah it's just you know for me it's

562
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:38,089
excitement you know and you know winning

563
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,330
cups and all that that's definitely

564
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:43,399
fired me up having you know one of my

565
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:45,259
best friends in the world Chris watching

566
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,019

567
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:52,490

568
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:54,589
friends take this this journey we're on

569
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:58,099
right now and run with it you know cuz

570
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:59,869
you know it wasn't really it's kind of a

571
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:02,089
half half split around here probably

572
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:04,699
even less probably a 30/70 of people

573
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:07,970
that went the way that we went and you

574
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,069
know really it was a pretty scary scary

575
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:13,069
move that we did you know go from

576
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:15,230
outlaws to you know be out in the public

577
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:17,509

578
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:20,690
interviews and you know tell your life I

579
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:23,390
mean it definitely wasn't easy so I'm

580
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:26,029
saying all of this type of stuff is what

581
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:29,030
is getting me excited and keeping me

582
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:31,970
going and this this way I mean I I love

583
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:35,899
the plant I love growing I'm a very

584
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:37,970
small scale farmer still and that's fine

585
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,400
with me you you know I mean I'd rather

586
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:45,529
do quality over quantity any day of the

587
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:49,280
week you know all day all day so you

588
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:53,839
have a big ol filing cabinet behind you

589
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:56,809
is that for all your paperwork you have

590
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:59,689
to do now there's so much paperwork it's

591
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:00,409
yeah that part of the game now you're

592
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,710
gonna bum me out

593
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:09,790
see now you're crying I'm dressing a

594
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:12,110
part of the conversation leave metric I

595
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:14,869
wanted to hire someone but my wife

596
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:17,240
wanted to take that on well it's not the

597
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:19,969
best thing for a relationship is metric

598
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,779
they'll tell you right now but yeah the

599
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:26,630
county the paperwork we had a hard three

600
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:29,029
years and you know right now we're still

601
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,830
battling and I mean I've up stuff with

602
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:33,349
the county that I've been working on for

603
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:34,849
three years straight the easiest stuff

604
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:36,679
you would think would be like let's just

605
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:39,049
get it done and it's just not done you

606
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,150
know so yeah the paperwork is a

607
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:43,069
nightmare but we're all starting to

608
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:45,170
settle in and figure out where we're at

609
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:48,619
in this game and how you know how it's

610
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:52,100
gonna pan out and we know that hey we

611
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:54,379
are essential right we know that I mean

612
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:56,750
it's amazing right now you know and

613
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,190
what's happening in this time and not

614
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:02,099
people love wheat and

615
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:05,279
it blows my mind right now seeing how

616
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:08,399
much weed is out there and the demand

617
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,279
for our weed is just as high as ever you

618
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:15,090
know and that's you know like when I

619
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,980
scroll through Instagram and you know

620
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:19,079
I'm looking pretty much everything on my

621
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,329
Instagram is weed because you know let's

622
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:24,960
let's really follow and you'll come

623
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:27,809
across giant green houses that are you

624
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,819
know I don't know can I don't know were

625
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:31,829
they 20,000 square foot green Alice's

626
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:34,109
maybe even bigger with just lights and

627
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:35,809
this not I school right through that I

628
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:39,389
don't even I don't care about that I

629
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:41,490
look at like a plant and some small farm

630
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,710
and you see little veggies around and

631
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,960
just a beautiful bud and that's what I

632
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,420
want to look at I mean the rest of its

633
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,920
just like Rose a weed I don't really I

634
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,380
don't care they're probably feeding it

635
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,360
tons of salts and crap and it just

636
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:59,370
doesn't really mean anything to me and I

637
00:28:54,359 --> 00:29:00,959
know because I know what's the best and

638
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,879
that's really what comes back to the

639
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,970
consumers it's not fair a lot of them

640
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,110
don't know what is what they're smoking

641
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,650
what they're putting in their body out

642
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:15,000
there you know are you doing what to

643
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:16,740
turn to your idea - I didn't today a lot

644
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,019
of people you know that people come up

645
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,509
here you can set these up you put like

646
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:23,879
you go all year round like I need a

647
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:26,369
break and I have kids I have a life I

648

649
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:32,279

650
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:34,769
year old and yeah I don't need to go

651
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:36,829
around all year this is this is plenty I

652
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:40,079
mean we've been doing it like all year

653
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:41,309
our whole life I mean we grow indoor and

654
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,490
your outdoor indoor outdoor

655
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:47,099
indoor/outdoor so to be able to change

656
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:50,460
get rid of the indoor throw keep on you

657
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:52,769
know growing beautiful full Sun and you

658
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,559
know with our climate it's just it's

659
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:57,690
it's worked out great you know I mean

660
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:59,339
laughs you never know what the weather

661
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,110
is gonna hear last year we probably

662
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:04,709
could have done a third round it's you

663
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:07,500
know stay beautiful for longer but it's

664
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,750
fine with me man it's it's plenty of

665
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,910
weed and you really have to put all your

666
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,930
energy into it if you really want the

667
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,990
product that

668
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:18,240
want to give to the consumer I I'm

669
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,910
looking at the chat on YouTube and a

670
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,150
brass Sakhalin said I'd go as far as

671
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:31,290
this a bag appeal is set Canada's back

672
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:34,200
with bullshit breeding goals so Chris

673
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:36,599
can you talk about like you know you're

674
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:40,110
you're on Jason's farm a lot can you

675
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:44,429
talk about kind of I mean I know you you

676
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:48,029
hung up the cleats as a grower so I want

677
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:49,200
to talk about nice so what do you what

678
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:53,519
do you what are you running at home

679
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,850
right now then let's see I've been

680
00:30:53,519 --> 00:31:00,420
playing with I got a bunch of genetics

681
00:30:56,849 --> 00:31:04,379
that I actually like years ago and then

682
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:06,539
I got up this crucial og seed from this

683
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,550
dude up in Harris the prodigy up - so

684
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:09,990
I'm like 25 years ago one of the dudes

685
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:11,879
there's like 10 people that claim they

686
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:15,660
brought it up there whatever wherever it

687
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,350
came from I don't care I'm not a an OG

688
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,509
ajita

689
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:20,519
that actually ended I planted it is a

690
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:22,710
back seat and that being a male so I

691
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,139
started pollinating all these different

692
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:27,930
genetics with that one male that I got

693
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,490
so and then I've been pulling mammals

694
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,279
out a lot to pollinate stuff every year

695
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:34,980
but so there's it's six different six

696
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:38,279
plants six different strains they're all

697
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,809
like crosses of this og there's a got a

698
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:45,149
fruit loop seed from Johnny

699
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:47,609
Casali I got an XJ there's a milk and

700
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:50,280
cookie seed that hyleri from LA gave me

701
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:52,639
at San Bernardino High Times cup like

702
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:55,680
four years ago

703
00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:00,410
there's a train rub purple Oracle train

704
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:03,000
Red Cross it's stupid stupid stupid fire

705
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:04,500
I'm gonna start to trickle these out

706
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,319
next year they're starting to stabilize

707
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,990
finally so should be some good stuff

708
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:14,179
coming out but uh last year I grew my

709
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:14,180
first 12 pounder haha

710
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:23,150
see ya get into the in terms of or what

711
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:26,579
were you asking about Jason's farm

712
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,990
you've watched him so what

713
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:31,259
what have you seen with kind of the

714
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:34,710
evolution of his journey whether its

715
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:39,839
cultivation style or running a

716
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:44,370
professional small operation or well I

717
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:47,099
really really really am stoked he

718
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:51,898
transitioned over to teas I did I made

719
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:54,928
that move myself seven or eight years

720
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:59,009
ago and then I haven't been growing much

721
00:32:54,929 --> 00:33:02,970
or for the last few years but it went

722
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:04,710
from spending however much money on

723
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:08,750
plastic bottles for it'll full of

724
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:12,000
fertilizer to 50-pound bags of

725
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:14,700
amendments into a brew tank and the cost

726
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,690
of goods dropped tremendously terpene

727
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:21,480
profiles shot out the fucking roof so

728
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,730
I'm a I'm a firm believer and auntie's

729
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,509
and I'm super stoked jason has trans

730
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:29,509
transition that direction for sure man

731
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:31,408
I'm all over the place though III

732
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:34,138
unfortunately I would like to spend more

733
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:35,940
time with Jason on this farm but I mean

734
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:39,028
I've been there three or four times this

735
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:42,389
year and and I what I can say is that

736
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:45,119
his crop this year looks phenomenal

737
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:48,000
so whatever the hell he's doing this

738
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:52,349
year is good so that the roots organic

739
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,980
decision and that relationship is has so

740
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:58,469
far proven to be a good one and you know

741
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,620
I really appreciate what you said Jason

742
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:04,350
about the honesty of where we've came

743
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:06,479
from in terms of our practices out there

744
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:08,699
in the hills and all these people up

745
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,639
here up and so on and humbled and in the

746
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:13,739
Admiral Triangle trying to be all

747
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,358
righteous about organic and stuff which

748
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:17,009
we should be now at this point and we

749
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,619
should be pushing that and we should all

750
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,240
be growing organic but anybody like

751
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:23,879
Jason said that claims that so they've

752
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,529
been doing for forever is a bunch of

753
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:27,449
crap so we're all learning we're all

754
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:31,019
evolving we're all trying to be better

755
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:33,509
people and do better things we were

756
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:35,009
young and dumb and trying to make a

757
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:37,349
bunch of money and it didn't you know

758
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,990
though not everybody was that there's a

759
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:40,510
lot of conscious you know earthy people

760
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:43,209
up there the

761
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:46,870
have always been that way and didn't you

762
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,789
use blue juice grow more and spray of it

763
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:51,130
or and they didn't do that but there's a

764
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:53,440
big percentage of people up there that

765
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:58,380
certainly did so I appreciate the

766
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:01,269
honesty and the candidness there and the

767
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:03,250
again were were we're here the standards

768
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:06,130
our face ourselves in the mirror about

769
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:10,119
our our prior lives and how we can

770
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:12,099
improve our current actions in this

771
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:14,559
world jason has kids you know he's going

772
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:16,900
to leave this farm to his kids and so a

773
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,179
piece of property is super important to

774
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,789
him and keeping it clean and and then

775
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:24,519
like he also said that you know I

776
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:26,769
believe the education to consumers for

777
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:29,739
sure some of it certainly should be

778
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:32,280
pointed as Jason said towards what are

779
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:35,049
you putting into your body and if

780
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,370
consumers knew I think a lot of them

781
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,590
maybe they just don't care they're

782
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:41,619
eating McDonald's anyway you know so

783
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:43,090
maybe the most consumers don't care but

784
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:46,869
the ones that do we don't grow enough

785
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:49,990
pot to feed all the consumers anyway

786
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:51,909
so let's find those consumers that do

787
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:53,619
care because there are enough of them

788
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:55,389
that do care they just don't know where

789
00:35:53,619 --> 00:36:00,339
to find us yet they're they're finding

790
00:35:55,389 --> 00:36:03,069
us slowly but surely but so anyway

791
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:06,240
Jason's farm is absolutely beautiful

792
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:08,500
it's been incredible to watching the

793
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:11,500
evolution of him as a businessman and

794
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,420
and community leader and a farmer as

795
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,909
well it's not just the cannabis

796
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:18,340
evolution we're like you know we're

797
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:20,769
growing up and gotten our eyes and

798
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:23,680
crossing our T's and becoming real real

799
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:25,630
life businessmen which is a cool thing

800
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,750
to you know we're stepping up to the

801
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:30,309
plate as a community on that level so

802
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:32,980
and Kevin certainly been leading that

803
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:35,710
charge absolutely no hot air they're

804
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,480
like you you took it seriously to the

805
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:41,260
professional level from the get-go when

806
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:43,630
this 215 kicked I kicked off and a large

807
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,360
percentage of the people I know weren't

808
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:47,860
into that yet and in fact believe I've

809
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,550
always believed in the medicine but

810
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:53,309
we're anti any kind of regulation or

811
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:56,640
legality

812
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:59,579
so the fact that he took the initiative

813
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,429
and became a leader in our community and

814
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:04,650
in the cannabis community and and has

815
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:06,989
been driving a major driving force and

816
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:10,289
that is super inspirational to me and

817
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:11,759
and you know I felt like I kind of

818
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:14,279
stepped out of the closet pretty early

819
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,880
and so huh but Kevin was in that shit

820
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,470
ten years before me so kudos to that for

821
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,869
leading the charge and kind of opening

822
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:24,659
the door for the rest of us you know

823
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:28,889
they lived that old life to be

824
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:30,480
comfortable more comfortable maybe not

825
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:36,079
comfortable but a little more

826
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:42,719
comfortable stepping into this new life

827
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:47,099
so it's it's an exciting time for for me

828
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:49,589
and for for us man I really believe we

829
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:52,889
made the right decision and decisions

830
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:55,980
heading this direction I just believe it

831
00:37:52,889 --> 00:38:00,239
with every fragment of my being the

832
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:02,610
indicators currently are proving that to

833
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,579
be so what when you say this direction

834
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:09,539
do you mean going into the legal legal

835
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:13,559
market okay so yes sir so given that all

836
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:17,690
three of you are long-term cultivators

837
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:24,269
and operating in in the joyful

838
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:26,670
California legal cannabis system Chris

839
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:29,219
you were when we started touching on

840
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:32,430
business you were talking about kind of

841
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:34,679
the wholesale or the bulk so can you

842
00:38:32,429 --> 00:38:37,199
talk about the evolution of your vision

843
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:40,349
from like because at one point you were

844
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:43,349
growing and you decided entering a legal

845
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:46,699
market that did you were you growing

846
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:49,289
when you first entered the legal market

847
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:51,599
absolutely and what stopped me from

848
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:59,340
cultivating is the police coming to my

849
00:38:51,599 --> 00:39:02,369
farm know I had a collective I had a

850
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:04,440
patient base the Mendocino County was

851
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:07,108
dragging their feet in their ordinance

852
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,048
in place and

853
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:11,788
so I focus all my my energy on my

854
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:16,309
commercial piece of property in Benton

855
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:20,430
bow and my distribution retail

856
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:22,470
manufacturing nursery permit permits

857
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:26,248
that I filed with Humboldt County for

858
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:29,189
that piece of property and kept on

859
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:31,048
cultivating because I had a patient base

860
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:36,048
and a collective and I was feeding

861
00:39:31,048 --> 00:39:41,278
patients medicine men see no County then

862
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:44,309
finalized their ordinance and I didn't

863
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:47,509
have the bandwidth to do it all and I

864
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:50,910
was focused on the Bembo property and I

865
00:39:47,509 --> 00:39:55,588
really little I mean like 4,000 square

866
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:57,690
feet little and I'm at the very very

867
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:59,460
very very very very northern tip with

868
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:01,528
Mendocino County knowing what they would

869
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,749
have to fly over a drive-by to come to

870
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:09,630
my house where I live how's my

871
00:40:03,748 --> 00:40:12,298
grandparents built and they decided to

872
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:16,410
drive two and half hours from Ukiah with

873
00:40:12,298 --> 00:40:21,329
35 people to bust my 4,000 square-foot

874
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:23,730
farm driving by acres and acres and

875
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:26,609
acres of illegal pot with no collective

876
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:28,980
or patient base so fuck you Mendocino

877
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:31,920
County and fuck you fucking fishing game

878
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:42,900
for doing that what what year what year

879
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:45,210
was that the reality is it I honed of

880
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:48,088
skill in over this fucking crazy life of

881
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:49,980
finding the silver lining and the silver

882
00:40:48,088 --> 00:40:58,949
lining in that was that I didn't go to

883
00:40:49,980 --> 00:41:00,929
jail and I focused 100% of my energy on

884
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:02,548
my commercial piece of property in Bembo

885
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:05,190
and getting this distribution thing off

886
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:07,768
the ground and if I wouldn't have done

887
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:10,230
that I would still be spread out I would

888
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:12,238
still be all over the place I wouldn't

889
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:15,509
have focused I wouldn't have honed in on

890
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:18,568
something and so that was the beginning

891
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:20,548
of the honing and the evolution and the

892
00:41:18,568 --> 00:41:23,938
or the whatever

893
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:29,929
you want to call it from that period to

894
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:36,449
now has been keeping my ears wide open

895
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:39,900
listening sponging watching not talking

896
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:43,139
and seeing what all these other entities

897
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:49,858
were doing and the mistakes they were

898
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:52,798
making and having conversations more so

899
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:56,338
for intelligence with really big

900
00:41:52,798 --> 00:42:01,338
investors and and listening to them and

901
00:41:56,338 --> 00:42:03,869
and having them kind of guide and and

902
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:06,268
say well Wow and maybe you should do

903
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:08,400
this or maybe you should do that so

904
00:42:06,268 --> 00:42:10,348
maybe you shouldn't do all that maybe

905
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,099
you should do this one thing and do it

906
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:15,539
really well some investors conversations

907
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:17,910
will know that's the right thing to do

908
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:20,069
you need 10 mil today you need 20

909
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:22,379
million that million isn't enough you

910
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:24,358
need 20 million right now let me force

911
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:28,469
it down your face you need to grow fast

912
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:33,150
and all I got to say to that is that's

913
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:35,249
the wrong strategy and slow steady and

914
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,139
organic has proven to be the way for

915
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:39,808
redwood roots I'm not saying that any

916
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:45,108
other way is right or wrong for anyone

917
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:45,109
else but I know what's worked for us and

918
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:51,478
you know we still have our eyes on

919
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:54,739
retail we still have our eyes on

920
00:42:51,478 --> 00:42:58,259
delivery we still have our eyes on

921
00:42:54,739 --> 00:43:01,259
maybe nursery certainly have our eyes on

922
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:04,438
processing as a distribution company we

923
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:06,389
know how crucial processing is any-any

924
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:07,920
and i saw that coming two years ago I

925
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:11,578
just haven't had the capital or the

926
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,999
funding or the bandwidth to get ahead of

927
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:18,239
the game but I saw this second coming

928
00:43:14,998 --> 00:43:26,669
years ago I knew exactly where this was

929
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:28,978
going and but you know we don't have to

930
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,959
listen to anybody tell us what to do or

931
00:43:28,978 --> 00:43:33,859
where to spend our money or how to grow

932
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:38,210
we get to do that on our own

933
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:39,740
and at the same time as listen to what

934
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,539
other people have to say in their

935
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:43,549
opinions of where we should go and what

936
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:45,739
we should do but at the end of the day

937
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:52,640
we get to make our calls and make that

938
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:59,539
decision for ourselves so sorry I'm kind

939
00:43:52,639 --> 00:44:02,029
of rambling now but hey Chris talk a

940
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:05,960
little bit more about the economics of

941
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:08,390
bulk versus branded or retail and what

942
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,610
you're seeing out there both gets

943
00:44:08,389 --> 00:44:14,259
farmers paid immediately if they're

944
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:18,590
working with the right distributor ha

945
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:23,450
some distributors not so much so retail

946
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:27,980
is brutal it is fucking brutal it's

947
00:44:23,449 --> 00:44:30,829
cutthroat it is people are straight

948
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:34,820
Corporate America America modelling

949
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:36,619
under pricing to get market share and

950
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:39,550
putting little guys at trying to put

951
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:43,179
little guys out sell an $8 fucking AIDS

952
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:46,519
fuck you ain't the way to fucking play

953
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:48,529
and just so we know like what we're

954
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:51,650
talking about how many forms are you

955
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:55,400
like distributing for and getting their

956
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:59,180
product out there for probably this year

957
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:03,710
we sold product from 120 farms the next

958
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:06,319
year I bet it will be 240 and I assume

959
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:08,659
you started with kind of the farms that

960
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,610
were all your friends like a Jason and

961
00:45:08,659 --> 00:45:12,529
you're fulfilling a need for him because

962
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:14,240
what what I've seen and you know a lot

963
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:17,269
of friends who are up in the hills or

964
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,309
wherever it's like you're at the total

965
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:22,460
mercy of some distributor who just

966
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:25,099
doesn't give a shit about you who's then

967
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,690
gonna take your product and bring it to

968
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:29,630
a shop that doesn't give a shit about

969
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,610
you and you know you don't have the time

970
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:34,789
to get off the farm and so to have

971
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:36,769
somebody who I'm talking about the two

972
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:38,960
of you who you've known for a long time

973
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:41,030
who you trust who's out there trying to

974
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,490
do right by you must be I mean Jason

975
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:45,920
that must be a godsend to have Chris as

976
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:47,959
someone you deal with rather than you

977
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,570
know random distributors

978
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:56,510
cold calling you and wanting to strike

979
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:59,900
deals I mean 100% it's like you said I

980
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:03,260
mean the wholesale market is easy you

981
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:06,680
know it's it's easy to get paid but you

982
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:09,140
know we really I got really lucky you

983
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:11,118
know obviously to get my name out the

984
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:14,690
way I did I mean it started with Kevin

985
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:17,210
at the golden tarps 2017 you know I got

986
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,190
the win there with the Green Lantern and

987
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:22,940
it started rolling from there

988
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:24,710
so yeah the wholesale works for anyone

989
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:28,280
and it's quick it's you know you saw

990
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:31,519
your weed you get some so and so they

991
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,740
get to claim your wonderful grown herb

992
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:36,019
and put on the shelf as theirs and you

993
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:39,289
know that's that's great I mean you get

994
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:42,230
paid and you know your family gets gets

995
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:43,909
the eat and it all works but it's really

996
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:46,280
about making the right decisions and

997
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:48,679
it's when you don't know what you're

998
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,450
doing you know I don't really want to

999
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:52,309
put out too many names out there but

1000
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:53,480
it's like when I first won the Cup and I

1001
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,670
went with you know

1002
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,858
well corner let's just say you know I

1003
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:00,079
don't have much bad to say about him but

1004
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:02,719
I didn't really know you know I've Chris

1005
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,210
my best friend you know he's doing his

1006
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:07,219
thing and I was so excited you know I

1007
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:09,170
was like oh my god maybe I could get out

1008
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:12,169
there this is really happening I didn't

1009
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:18,320
know what what route to go I was more

1010
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:21,079
acting on excitement and and you know so

1011
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:23,660
I had to learn right and you know I did

1012
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:24,348
a little thing with them and honestly it

1013
00:47:23,659 --> 00:47:25,909
was great

1014
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:28,099
they didn't be right but I wasn't

1015
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:29,629
feeling it I didn't feel it my sword I

1016
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:31,539
felt my heart didn't really make me feel

1017
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:34,820
great

1018
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:37,130
what made me feel good was showing up

1019
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,980

1020

1030
00:48:05,389 --> 00:48:11,150
both when this all started unrolling you

1031
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:12,710

00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:19,069
I mean it's just this is our life

1035
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:22,309
this isn't we aren't just jumping in we

1036
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:26,000
aren't 2017 we started what we this is

1037
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:27,769
our life and I started feeling like oh

1038

1039
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:31,550

1040
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:34,070
pushed out of our fucking heritage it's

1041
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:36,710
gone you know and and it was scary but I

1042
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:40,430
knew there was something deeper I

1043
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:41,840
remember one of the first days sitting

1044
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:43,460
around with Chris was coming up with

1045
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,289
this redwood roots and we're all

1046
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,480
deciding if we were gonna sign like

1047
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:49,250
basically these affidavits with the

1048
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,769
county and a lot of people said if we

1049
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,510
sign this or that we're gonna get fuckin

1050
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:55,670
we're admitting everything and we're

1051
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:57,560
gonna probably you audit it and go to

1052
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:00,170
jail you know I mean we didn't know what

1053
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:02,420
the hell is going on so basically you

1054
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:05,360
know go through this journey and having

1055
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:09,289
friends like Chris to be able to console

1056
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:11,120
in and talk in and then obviously work

1057
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:13,190
with is a blessing

1058
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,559
I mean without them I'd feel alone and

1059
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:17,450
know like I said I'd have a lot of

1060
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:19,039
friends that feel different about all

1061
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:21,739
this you know they want the whole other

1062
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,960
route and you know I still hope the best

1063
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:26,029
for them you know I don't I don't ever

1064
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:30,079
want to see somebody go to jail for

1065
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:32,930

1068
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:41,150
in I feel like I was meant to be in this

1069
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:43,010
position I feel like Chris was meant to

1070
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:45,619
be in this position and there's a lot of

1071
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:50,240
other people and our that were meant to

1072
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:53,690
be in this position um you know I'm

1073
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:55,879
excited to work with Chris I went he

1074
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:57,650
basically watching him like you know we

1075
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,990
were I was still growing weed I was

1076

still making money I was surviving I

1077
00:49:59,989 --> 00:50:06,319
mean I watched him give up everything

1078
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:09,920
and basically go deep deep in the hole

1079
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:12,110
and work his ass off and had so many

1080
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,559
people not believed what he was going to

1081
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:16,329
do was going to really work out

1082
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,099
I didn't believe it I fuckin knew he was

1083
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:19,960
gonna do it because you hear him talk

1084
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:22,599

1230
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:57,980

1235
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:14,030

1236
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:16,760
for some of my weed and forever writing

1237
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:18,590

picture he opened it up and these little

1240
00:57:20,659 --> 00:57:25,699
shitty nurdles of weed were in this hand

1241
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,489
and I was just I wanted to drive to him

1242
00:57:25,699 --> 00:57:31,009
and hand him a bag of weed like so

1243
00:57:28,489 --> 00:57:35,739
basically I want I want the best if it's

1244
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:38,720
my half assed lookit so what's funny is

1245
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:40,489
someone on the chats that I tried Flo

1246
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:42,379
Connor wants blueberry muffins from

1247
00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:50,899
Bryce line and it's smoked like it was

1248
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:52,910
stored in a car for a year no no to say

1249
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:56,059
about that because they they do grow

1250
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:57,920
some good herb but you know if you over

1251
00:57:56,059 --> 00:58:00,170
by you herb and you know got the door

1252
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,990
and it's in a little jar for a long

1253
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:04,849
fucking time well the Crosley excuse me

1254
00:58:02,989 --> 00:58:08,539
that daughter in there them cussing away

1255
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:11,269
but yeah let's get here good yeah no I

1256
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:14,509
mean you know it's kind of that comes

1257
00:58:11,269 --> 00:58:16,009
out also to the distributor you know you

1258
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:19,070
hope a distributor is gonna put a

1259
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:20,840
beautiful mug in a jar and not put some

1260
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:23,300
disc crappy little buds in the jar

1261
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,490
because these consumers are paying a lot

1262
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:28,220
of money and I'll tell you right now

1263
00:58:25,489 --> 00:58:31,399
that money is not barely any of us going

1264
00:58:28,219 --> 00:58:35,929
to us okay you know if there's so many

1265
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:38,360
middleman you know the state there's so

1266
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:40,789
many middlemen that you know there I

1267
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:44,180
feel for how much of consumers have to

1268
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:48,289
pay for a quality product it's not fair

1269
00:58:44,179 --> 00:58:51,349
and it's not the growers reaping those

1270
00:58:48,289 --> 00:58:54,619
those benefits not even probably ten

1271
00:58:51,349 --> 00:58:57,589
percent of it honestly Chris you're

1272
00:58:54,619 --> 00:59:01,969
primarily focused on bulk now sore are

1273
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:05,360
you gonna be bringing Jason's product to

1274
00:59:01,969 --> 00:59:08,179
this hit his brand his CPG brand product

1275
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:09,360
to market or are you gonna stay focused

1276
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:11,009
on bolt like

1277
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:14,700
you're gonna mix it up do a little of

1278
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:16,980
both no I said before we're

1279
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:18,869
transitioning a pretty good chunk of our

1280
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,789
energy back towards retail in the brand

1281
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:23,670
both redwood roots brand and a very

1282
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:27,000
limited select group of farmer brands

1283
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:29,670
like Jason's Ridgeline we just got we're

1284
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,219
very honoured at the opportunity to to

1285
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:34,170
work on a very small level with the

1286
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:37,409
farmer farmers cut which is I think

1287
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:39,240
Emeril grown coops I believe it's their

1288
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:42,449
their new brand but Daniel Stein from

1289
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:44,699
Bryson forest mARMS Happy Days KC O'Neal

1290
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:46,169
and then I'm down Elm Farms I'm up in

1291
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:48,629
the Grass Valley area are the three

1292
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:51,030
first kind of flagship farms that are

1293
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:54,180
participating with the brand but it's a

1294
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:57,269
co-op grown the the packaging is just

1295
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:59,759
fucking beautiful it's like a kind of

1296
00:59:57,269 --> 01:00:03,210
like a not hand scissors trim but

1297
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:07,290
literally like hand leaf trimmed buds in

1298
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:09,710
a half ounce jar and then there's a

1299
01:00:07,289 --> 01:00:12,599
couple other farm brands son love farms

1300
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:15,300
we got some pot of his in jars already

1301
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:17,730
green light farms 7:07 we've got some of

1302
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:19,650
his herb audience of jars we have a

1303
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:22,079
bunch of conversations going that have

1304
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:24,539
been going now for quite some time

1305
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,739
see it's planted year or two years ago

1306
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:29,190
even with some of these conversations

1307
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:30,869
but some collab projects some collab

1308
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:34,320
projects for some news Hughes for

1309
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:38,909
Redwood roots some some concentrate

1310
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:41,280
lines some tincture some tincture lines

1311
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:44,609
South health and wellness lines we're

1312
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:47,040
going to be ramping up the brand redwood

1313
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:48,630
roots brand and start starting to get to

1314
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:51,119
retail here over the course of the

1315
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:56,099
summer leading into next fall we're

1316
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:59,339
looking at our strategy is is hone in on

1317
01:00:56,099 --> 01:01:01,230
a very limited small number select group

1318
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:03,539
of shops that are already representing

1319
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:07,800
brands like ours that are willing to pay

1320
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:10,259
the price let the consumers come get the

1321
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:13,590
pot and then it'll spread slowly and

1322
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:16,620
organically from those kind of retail

1323
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:19,470
locations and then we can spread out and

1324
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:22,500
go from there but I we feel like we're

1325
01:01:19,469 --> 01:01:23,309
not going into every 12 dollar wholesale

1326
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,929
eight to spend

1327
01:01:23,309 --> 01:01:27,869
three and trying to get into 600 shops

1328
01:01:24,929 --> 01:01:29,909
we're gonna try to get into 50 shops and

1329
01:01:27,869 --> 01:01:32,190
they're all going to be high-end high

1330
01:01:29,909 --> 01:01:33,980
price shops it will pay the price to get

1331
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:36,929
these farmers the money they deserve and

1332
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:39,150
let it grow slow in organic we'll have

1333
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:40,859
some some budget skews to get into those

1334
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:43,139
other shops they don't want to pay what

1335
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:44,730
we want to you know pay that the price

1336
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:47,670
that we want to charge so we'll have

1337
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:50,670
some some budget outs half ounce eight

1338
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:52,590
smalls Duff trim

1339
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:55,019
you know the whole pouch idea

1340
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:57,539
everybody's going after the small shit

1341
01:01:55,019 --> 01:02:02,550
now it's what I see and what I'm hearing

1342
01:01:57,539 --> 01:02:04,710
is concentrates have lost their muster a

1343
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:06,450
little bit our live residents still the

1344
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:09,059
thing but there's people like raw garden

1345
01:02:06,449 --> 01:02:11,519
that are pushing it out for $10 a gram

1346
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:14,369
or some crazy shit so there'd it's that

1347
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:16,889
that market is it's all over the place

1348
01:02:14,369 --> 01:02:19,799
it's super fucking difficult to put your

1349
01:02:16,889 --> 01:02:22,829
finger on it and even even contemplate

1350
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:24,630
where it's going whereas all these other

1351
01:02:22,829 --> 01:02:28,469
SKUs are a little more settled I feel

1352
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:30,240
like at least for right now and so we're

1353
01:02:28,469 --> 01:02:32,909
we're definitely going to go back after

1354
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:35,129
retail for sure and Jason's Jason's new

1355
01:02:32,909 --> 01:02:38,069
jars are the inspiration to get back at

1356
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:40,260
it and that the booth that the Emerald

1357
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:43,080
cup that we had in the you know eight

1358
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:45,450
out of the ten top winners are people we

1359
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:52,139
represent 13 out of the top 20 winners

1360
01:02:45,449 --> 01:02:54,710
are people we represent so to to let

1361
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:59,869
that opportunity slide it would be

1362
01:02:54,710 --> 01:03:03,000
fucking lunatic so we we have you know

1363
01:02:59,869 --> 01:03:05,219
we got a bunch of urban jars right after

1364
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,340
the cup and did a little launch locally

1365
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:11,789
and got into Sonoma area blah blah blah

1366
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:14,789
and and then the reality is that you

1367
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:16,949
know bootstraps grassroots that's a real

1368
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:18,719
thing we don't just have a bunch of

1369
01:03:16,949 --> 01:03:22,710
capital to do it with to do it all

1370
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:24,599
we just don't and our margins we're

1371
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:28,170
making a little bit of money selling

1372
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:31,079
bulk wholesale and and again able to get

1373
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:34,079
these farmers paid real quick and and

1374
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:37,199
the money they're asking in and so that

1375
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:39,869
keeps the boat floating we

1376
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:42,619
bill and I've always believed that shelf

1377
01:03:39,869 --> 01:03:45,779
space in the brand is the long game and

1378
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:49,079
that wholesale getting farmers paid and

1379
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:54,780
getting up just giving us the ability to

1380
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:57,809
to survive this hurricane and hunker

1381
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:59,820
down and and and just like Jason said

1382
01:03:57,809 --> 01:04:05,070
keep the brands relevant on some level

1383
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:07,920
but I mean ridgelines not going to be in

1384
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:10,500
every shop in the state that ever he

1385
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,180
doesn't grow enough pot you know even if

1386
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,010
he put his whole thousand pounds in his

1387
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:16,289
jars that's gonna get into maybe a

1388
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:18,570
hundred shops if you want to service

1389
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:20,789
those hundred shops all year and once

1390
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:23,130
you get into a shop you don't ever want

1391
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:25,050
to lose that shelf space so there's a

1392
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:26,490
lot of farmers with brands that think

1393
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:28,769
they're gonna go do it and build it and

1394
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:30,959
I hope the best worm but I don't think

1395
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:34,139
it's a good strategy for them at this

1396
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,659
point in time I think it's it's way too

1397
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:38,039
competitive they're slotting fees still

1398
01:04:36,659 --> 01:04:41,029
out there there's no farmers that can

1399
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:46,619
afford a slotting fee are you kidding me

1400
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:48,990
so I still know that the brand is the

1401
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:50,849
long game but we we also just need to

1402
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:56,039
keep our community alive and and

1403
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:58,739
surviving these times and so I really

1404
01:04:56,039 --> 01:05:01,320
believe that we're still in another wave

1405
01:04:58,739 --> 01:05:04,679
of hunkering yeah we're gonna go to

1406
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:08,130
retail but we're not going big it's not

1407
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:11,219
time to go big yet it's just not it's

1408
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:13,349
time to hunker and fucking settle and

1409
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:15,779
hone in your processes and your

1410
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:18,659
procedures and your team and just get

1411
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:20,790
fucking Titus fucking all hell and then

1412
01:05:18,659 --> 01:05:22,769
you can keep going to battle with these

1413
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:25,259
big fuckers because that's what it's

1414
01:05:22,769 --> 01:05:25,829
really about we got ten people on our

1415
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,630
staff

1416
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:29,819
we're buying new vans we're hiring more

1417
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:33,119
employees we're not firing 40% of our

1418
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:36,210
staff and selling our vans and we're

1419
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:39,029
gonna continue to grow slow and steady

1420
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:42,179
and pick the right partners and be super

1421
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:45,180
fucking conscious and careful about what

1422
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:46,799
we do this is our money we're not

1423
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:50,309
playing with somebody else's fucking

1424
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,060
money this isn't R&amp;D money out of some

1425
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:53,840
bench

1426
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:56,730
capitalist fund that's literally

1427
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,110
$200,000 of R&amp;D money that could just

1428
01:05:56,730 --> 01:06:02,460
fucking vanish and they don't give a

1429
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:05,309
fuck this is our fucking life all of our

1430
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:07,470
lives not just me not just Jason there's

1431
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:09,750
a community of people up where we live

1432
01:06:07,469 --> 01:06:12,299
and I'm not just so um I'm not so um

1433
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:14,369
centric there used to be this soem thing

1434
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:16,740
it's like we're all the same people in

1435
01:06:14,369 --> 01:06:18,630
the Murrell triangle all of us are the

1436
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:20,399
same we're all trying to make it we're

1437
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:23,099
all trying to survive doing what we love

1438
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:27,059
to do we just want to stay where we live

1439
01:06:23,099 --> 01:06:30,329
where we love you know now I'm rambling

1440
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:32,699
again but so you know Chris one of the

1441
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:35,429
themes that's come through in in in

1442
01:06:32,699 --> 01:06:38,519
almost all the discussions we've had

1443
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:42,210
lately is that in the in the current

1444
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:45,630
environment smaller operations companies

1445
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:48,449
they're maybe a little more flexible or

1446
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:50,460
better able to survive than the larger

1447
01:06:48,449 --> 01:06:54,419
ones with more overhead what do you

1448
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:56,909
think about that well like I said we're

1449
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:59,670
hiring on staff and buying vans and

1450
01:06:56,909 --> 01:07:01,799
expanding slowly but surely and I all I

1451
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:04,260
hear from those bigger entities is

1452
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:08,039
implosion implosion implosion left right

1453
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:09,360
left right one after another so I don't

1454
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:12,210
think those companies are all gonna

1455
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:14,190
vanish those big guys but I don't know I

1456
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:18,449
think there could be there's a big shake

1457
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:20,250
I'm going on I don't I mean some of

1458
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:23,939
those companies are so big they're just

1459
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:26,280
they're gonna somebody even bigger than

1460
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:29,789
them is gonna buy them and just throw

1461
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:33,150
more money at it and I mean yeah I don't

1462
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:36,239
know man I just I feel like it's the

1463
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:37,619
proof is in the pudding about how to you

1464
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:40,169
know how to get where you're trying to

1465
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:44,250
go and it's just this this market is too

1466
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:46,470
unsettled it's it's no one still know

1467
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:47,730
anybody that says that they know what's

1468
01:07:46,469 --> 01:07:50,579
going to happen I'll punch him in the

1469
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:56,670
throat because they're just wrong they

1470
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:58,380
are in any business model when they

1471
01:07:56,670 --> 01:08:01,280
don't know what's going to happen unless

1472
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:04,920
they have money to throw away out it is

1473
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:07,410
going to just go crazy big and

1474
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:10,980
it's just not the right thing and so

1475
01:08:07,409 --> 01:08:12,389
we're very genuine and real about our

1476
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:14,550
grassroots nests and who knows maybe

1477
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:16,800
we'll take investors I'm not trying to

1478
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:18,930
say we'll never take an investment or

1479
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:22,110
partner with the venture capitalist firm

1480
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:24,300
or some corporation Patagonia is a

1481
01:08:22,109 --> 01:08:26,369
pretty cool corporation you know what I

1482
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:28,289
mean there's cool there's good people

1483
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:31,050
doing good things out there in the world

1484
01:08:28,289 --> 01:08:33,060
with their with their business so we're

1485
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:34,350
not in any hurry to go there and it

1486
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:38,070
would certainly have to be the right

1487
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:42,350
partner but for right now we're we're

1488
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:48,809
pretty we're pretty not comfortable

1489
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:54,510
comfortably uncomfortable maybe it might

1490
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:59,400
be a right way to say it I'm very

1491
01:08:54,510 --> 01:09:01,730
humbled and I'm this is not me but I'm

1492
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:04,139
really confident in our community and

1493
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:07,109
where we are today and what we're

1494
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:11,010
bringing to the table I am I'm really

1495
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:12,809
confident I think you know we've been

1496
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:17,039
talking about interstate international

1497
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:18,870
forever but there's a generation in

1498
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:21,210
SoCal which is the biggest market in the

1499
01:09:18,869 --> 01:09:22,649
world as we know it doesn't even know

1500
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:24,270
what Humboldt County is or where it's

1501
01:09:22,649 --> 01:09:26,039
from or they're no triangle no never

1502
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:28,230
care and they don't care and those are

1503
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:31,229
not our people the further away from

1504
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:34,829
Humboldt County you get the more

1505
01:09:31,229 --> 01:09:39,209
Humboldt County has a name because you

1506
01:09:34,829 --> 01:09:41,039
asked somebody in Australia cannabis you

1507
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:43,109
ask somebody in Spain you got somebody

1508
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:45,810
in fucking China they're gonna say

1509
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:50,069
Humboldt County that's what they still

1510
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:52,820
say and so there's plenty of high-end

1511
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:55,769
consumers across the world an interstate

1512
01:09:52,819 --> 01:09:59,819
that will pay us the price point and get

1513
01:09:55,770 --> 01:10:02,010
you your money Jason and Kevin and so

1514
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:03,750
it's slow steady let's sell the book

1515
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:06,060
let's get you paid let's keep the

1516
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:08,640
fucking boat floating let's get the

1517
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:11,160
brands relevant let's be really slow and

1518
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,050
cautious and steady and by the time

1519
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:14,369
interstate international opens we'll be

1520
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:18,510
sitting pretty and we'll be ready to

1521
01:10:14,369 --> 01:10:21,119
fucking crush well so that gets

1522
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:24,539
through the Appalachian conversation

1523
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:27,149
which is uh which is happening right now

1524
01:10:24,539 --> 01:10:29,159
so what for the three of you what are

1525
01:10:27,149 --> 01:10:32,549
your I mean obviously to say it's it's

1526
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:35,430
grown in Humboldt is one thing but that

1527
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:37,079
doesn't guarantee anything so do the

1528
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:45,930
three of you put any weight on the

1529
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:48,149
concept of Appalachian when when

1530
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:51,720
Appalachians personally came into this

1531
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:53,159
concept right I have a kid named Lou

1532
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:56,039
Bruner working for me who was a

1533
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:58,109
brilliant young dude and he had done all

1534
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:01,050
this extensive research on how

1535
01:10:58,109 --> 01:11:02,969
Appalachians add value and so when I got

1536
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:05,279
to talk to senator McGuire at my office

1537
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:07,650
and we had a conversation and said hey

1538
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:10,319
how do I help you in in your area and I

1539
01:11:07,649 --> 01:11:12,089
said listen for what we need long term

1540
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:14,699
we need some kind of certification that

1541
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:16,770
says organically produced because USDA

1542
01:11:14,699 --> 01:11:19,050
won't give it to us and we need an

1543
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:22,170
appellation of origin so that we can

1544
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:24,570
start to have brand value because our

1545
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:27,149
regions like even even not just humble

1546
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:30,960
but like Santa Cruz Grass Valley

1547
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:33,210
Trinity mando humble we're all known for

1548
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,890
producing really high quality cannabis

1549
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:36,899
and it may not be important in

1550
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:39,930
California but it sure the fuck is

1551
01:11:36,899 --> 01:11:42,059
important outside of California and so I

1552
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:44,640
had this opportunity to speak to him and

1553
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:46,590
that was really the initial conversation

1554
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,430
of our operations with politicians and

1555
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:52,110
Maguire watch that shit and so what

1556
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:53,820
happens next as we get into the whole

1557
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:55,109
Appalachian program and the

1558
01:11:53,819 --> 01:11:57,239
international canvass Farmers

1559
01:11:55,109 --> 01:11:59,369
Association starts to really go at it

1560
01:11:57,239 --> 01:12:02,219
and they start trying to form all the

1561
01:11:59,369 --> 01:12:05,059
pieces and now we've had all these

1562
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:07,470
different hearings that we had our

1563
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:09,360
moment to make comment the origins

1564
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:11,220
Council achene Coleman got heavily

1565
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:14,339
involved in it because they're they're

1566
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:16,050
far more developed in their in their

1567
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:18,989
direction of how they want to apply it

1568
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:21,510
but for us the long term the value is

1569
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:24,059
priceless and people argue about it

1570
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:27,510
because they say no one cares but that's

1571
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:29,400
not true that people do care and it's

1572
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:32,199
just that when you look at your market

1573
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:34,599
as a neighborhood market then that's not

1574
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:36,909
we were selling where we're trying to

1575
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:39,130
have a global market and Humboldt County

1576
01:12:36,909 --> 01:12:41,079
has a global market ability just like

1577
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:43,239
the other regions I mentioned and so for

1578
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:45,309
Jason and Fatah

1579
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:47,889
you know Jason's internationally

1580
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:49,420
recognized as a cultivator and and and

1581
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:51,700
the one thing I gotta tell you to write

1582
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:54,550
is that what you gotta remember is my

1583
01:12:51,699 --> 01:12:55,689
mom was a brilliant scientist and she

1584
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:58,119
said to me there was a quote from

1585
01:12:55,689 --> 01:13:01,359
Einstein but it said that intuition is

1586
01:12:58,119 --> 01:13:03,130
the is the epitome of all genius that

1587
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:05,799
it's the ultimate expression of genius

1588
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:07,180
the scientists have to study what people

1589
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,310
do to understand it but they don't

1590
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:11,890
necessarily create it and so you're a

1591
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:13,539
really good representation of that and

1592
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:15,460
many of people like you in Humboldt

1593
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:17,140
where your career knowledgeable that

1594
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:19,180
transcends science because ultimately

1595
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:29,430
how the fuck did you went back to back

1596
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:31,780
cups if you're not good right so-so and

1597
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:37,630
you got you got dudes at Noble County

1598
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:39,579
and Trinity and that's the cultivators

1599
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:41,829
to understand especially young common

1600
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:43,600
top cultivators because you have to

1601
01:13:41,829 --> 01:13:45,189
believe you can make an impact you have

1602
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,570
to believe you have a chance you have to

1603
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:48,129
believe that within the world of

1604
01:13:46,569 --> 01:13:50,829
cannabis you could be somebody too

1605
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:53,289
because our desire was always to live

1606
01:13:50,829 --> 01:13:55,359
this life forever and as we go into this

1607
01:13:53,289 --> 01:13:58,479
new phases that everything seems to be

1608
01:13:55,359 --> 01:14:00,429
so doom and fucking blue because all the

1609
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:02,829
cats that are coming in with buckets of

1610
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:05,800
money but that doesn't mean the customer

1611
01:14:02,829 --> 01:14:09,069
wants the product and so appellations

1612
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:10,960
are things that protect brand value and

1613
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:13,179
like Toph was saying none of us

1614
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:15,279
I'm only 20,000 square feet right so

1615
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:16,869
I'll never put enough jars it enough

1616
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:19,539
store to be in other stores where I'm at

1617
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:21,039
but I never intended to I wanted to be

1618
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:23,439
able to put the jars in the places where

1619
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:25,510
they were most desired and I wanted

1620
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:28,119
people bill appreciate that product and

1621
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:30,489
and as a group we're under an umbrella

1622
01:14:28,119 --> 01:14:32,199
where Hubble County farmers and our

1623
01:14:30,489 --> 01:14:34,840
individual Appalachians will help

1624
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:36,729
dictate expression to the consumer of

1625
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:39,880
say a gentleman's ship that he chooses

1626
01:14:36,729 --> 01:14:41,559
comes out this way we like it and Toph

1627
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:44,050
has other farmers and he grabbed some

1628
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,670
calves stuff does this it'll become a

1629
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:47,050
recognition like all

1630
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:49,539
azar people just don't walk around

1631
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:51,880
blindly they do in modern cannabis

1632
01:14:49,539 --> 01:14:53,890
because they haven't had any time to be

1633
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:56,590
able to practice playing and by and in

1634
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:59,170
these legal markets but as time goes on

1635
01:14:56,590 --> 01:15:01,179
it will and you're 40 I'm 54 but none of

1636
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:03,539
this stuff is really for me my time was

1637
01:15:01,179 --> 01:15:07,029
in 40 year prior when I was in the paint

1638
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:09,250
this is for my kids so like it's easy

1639
01:15:07,029 --> 01:15:10,929
for me to do this shit now because I

1640
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:12,789
know what I'm doing it for I'm doing it

1641
01:15:10,929 --> 01:15:16,079
specifically in further my region

1642
01:15:12,789 --> 01:15:19,029
further my crew further my children and

1643
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:20,769
and that's the part that appellations

1644
01:15:19,029 --> 01:15:22,599
has the value and it's the part that

1645
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:25,300
that cultivators have to understand that

1646
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,590
humble County Mendo Trinity these are

1647
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,810
regions where people been doing this

1648
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:31,360
multi generationally and they have a

1649
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:32,560
feel for the product that science has to

1650
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:34,929
understand it doesn't mean that a

1651
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,600
premium agronomist isn't a brilliant guy

1652
01:15:34,929 --> 01:15:40,060
and they don't do phenomenal work but

1653
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,460
you you you have to understand that

1654
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:45,219
aren't science is separate and that arts

1655
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:47,409
art and so what you see is a lot of art

1656
01:15:45,219 --> 01:15:49,659
and and that's where this Appalachian

1657
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:52,619
stuff comes into play and before I

1658
01:15:49,659 --> 01:15:56,139
forget too when we were talking about

1659
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:57,609
trends and heritage strains you got to

1660
01:15:56,140 --> 01:16:00,610
remember that the cats are to buy an

1661
01:15:57,609 --> 01:16:03,099
herb now did the smoked cigarettes they

1662
01:16:00,609 --> 01:16:05,939
smoked fake pens so their flavor

1663
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:08,260
addicted and so they they're at their

1664
01:16:05,939 --> 01:16:10,839
introduction to consumption of small

1665
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:12,280
bubbles was flavored vape pens that

1666
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,310
never happened in the whole history of

1667
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:16,779
dope smoking tobacco and forms of

1668
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:19,449
tobacco with it with it with the

1669
01:16:16,779 --> 01:16:21,609
interconnection between smoke right so

1670
01:16:19,448 --> 01:16:24,969
this group that comes in now is all vape

1671
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:27,429
pen so what they want is flavors because

1672
01:16:24,969 --> 01:16:29,859
that's what they know they don't they

1673
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:31,480
and then it's the trend goes by we'll be

1674
01:16:29,859 --> 01:16:34,509
able to reintroduce him to the earthy

1675
01:16:31,479 --> 01:16:37,448
things that were pop when we used to

1676
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:39,969
just grow herb but until until this they

1677
01:16:37,448 --> 01:16:42,339
get saturated with their desires being

1678
01:16:39,969 --> 01:16:45,069
fulfilled to make them happy with what

1679
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:46,810
they could soo-min a vape pen that's

1680
01:16:45,069 --> 01:16:48,579
what's gonna be the trend because all

1681
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,739
the fruits all the citruses all that

1682
01:16:48,579 --> 01:16:52,809
shit all the stuff coming from oil that

1683
01:16:50,738 --> 01:16:55,149
changed people's profile of what they

1684
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:57,429
wanted to smoke and need because it was

1685
01:16:55,149 --> 01:16:59,019
so fucking intense in the mouth that

1686
01:16:57,429 --> 01:17:01,569
they became disappointed and

1687
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:03,430
and so they had to start steer the

1688
01:17:01,569 --> 01:17:06,039
profiles in the flour into that

1689
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:08,530
expression to get the customers to come

1690
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:10,149
back in the flour but that's a trend

1691
01:17:08,529 --> 01:17:12,159
that's that'll tattle turn around over

1692
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:14,170
time too and that's why it's important

1693
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:15,909
to Bank varieties where you're going to

1694
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:17,770
hold the genetics so that you can go

1695
01:17:15,909 --> 01:17:20,889
reintroduce them into the market when it

1696
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:22,030
comes time but right now like I used you

1697
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:23,770
as an example the other day about

1698
01:17:22,029 --> 01:17:26,199
heritage strains didn't speech Russell

1699
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:28,570
look if people gave a fuck now and Jason

1700
01:17:26,199 --> 01:17:30,250
killed it what the white runs right why

1701
01:17:28,569 --> 01:17:33,130
why did that win when it was heritage

1702
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:34,930
people judging it so there were people

1703
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:38,440
that you know Swami judging it Swami

1704
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:39,909
seventy fuckin seven his birthday um he

1705
01:17:38,439 --> 01:17:42,909
smoked about as much air as anyone on

1706
01:17:39,909 --> 01:17:45,970
earth and he was uh he was a really a

1707
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:48,159
fat ik you know champion of your variety

1708
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:51,159
because he said hey the quality was just

1709
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:53,260
fuckin superlative that's that's the

1710
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:56,139
important part is that transition should

1711
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:58,780
change the regional influence has an

1712
01:17:56,140 --> 01:18:01,230
impact and us as a cultural influence

1713
01:17:58,779 --> 01:18:03,579
has an impact and all the regions around

1714
01:18:01,229 --> 01:18:05,259
California and and and for me anywhere

1715
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:07,329
in the United States and globally if

1716
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:09,100
your area produces something equality

1717
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:11,890
and the people are minded to produce

1718
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:13,780
something equality take advantage of

1719
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:16,119
what we did here in California with the

1720
01:18:13,779 --> 01:18:18,279
Appalachians and start to protect your

1721
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:19,960
brand for globalization because

1722
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:22,059
ultimately it's going to have a value

1723
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:24,430
and if you get your hands into it before

1724
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:26,560
someone makes it impossible to you do

1725
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:27,760
better on a community level and that's

1726
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,410
what we need is because we are a

1727
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:32,500
community that's the thing is all these

1728
01:18:29,409 --> 01:18:34,599
regions people know each other you you

1729
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:36,189
worked off a handshake for years and I

1730
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,690
was everybody I know handles a couple

1731
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:38,919
hundred million fucking dollars in cash

1732
01:18:37,689 --> 01:18:41,649
that ran through their fingers over

1733
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:44,079
their houses in Korea so when I talk to

1734
01:18:41,649 --> 01:18:45,729
these guys in the modern world about

1735
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:48,699
money and business I look at them and

1736
01:18:45,729 --> 01:18:51,939
I'm like fuck an ATM card in your pocket

1737
01:18:48,699 --> 01:18:54,159
and go cash looks like so it it makes it

1738
01:18:51,939 --> 01:18:55,599
hard to have a conversation that makes

1739
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:58,659
sense because they look at all of us

1740
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,640
like fuckin Stone Age but we were

1741
01:18:58,659 --> 01:19:02,559
actually really competent at the old

1742
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:05,289
business and our understanding what

1743
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:08,289
people like in cannabis is pretty

1744
01:19:05,289 --> 01:19:10,029
accurate still you know and and that's

1745
01:19:08,289 --> 01:19:11,560
that's the point that's why I said it's

1746
01:19:10,029 --> 01:19:12,859
nice to be on the show with you and be

1747
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:16,160
on top because I know

1748
01:19:12,859 --> 01:19:17,809
both you guys cuz you good dudes and you

1749
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:19,340
also about you shitting about your

1750
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:24,500
community that's as real as it can

1751
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:29,329
fucking be so do you think someone like

1752
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:30,979
Jason needs Appalachian - I mean

1753
01:19:29,329 --> 01:19:33,710
Appalachian is kind of more rigorous

1754
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:36,619
than obviously you know he's in southern

1755
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:39,859
Humboldt or you know wherever someone's

1756
01:19:36,619 --> 01:19:43,880
based like it he's already do that

1757
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:46,130
filing cabinet behind Jason has CDFA and

1758
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:48,470
then if he wants to do the organic

1759
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:50,840
comparable he'll have another filing

1760
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:55,090
cabinet for that and then if he wants to

1761
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:57,920
be Appalachian you know origin control a

1762
01:19:55,090 --> 01:20:01,039
southern Humboldt specific region he's

1763
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,989
gonna have a third filing cabinet as and

1764
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:07,159
how many what's the square footage of

1765
01:20:02,989 --> 01:20:19,429
your cultivation is a small as a not raw

1766
01:20:07,159 --> 01:20:21,199
garden sized operation it is worth it it

1767
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:23,900
is worth it for you because if you take

1768
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:25,340
a look at our wine moves we put wine in

1769
01:20:23,899 --> 01:20:27,500
the right market it's worth five times

1770
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:29,539
more than it is in a regular market so

1771
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:31,069
stuff coming out of Napa sells for four

1772
01:20:29,539 --> 01:20:32,960
hundred and now for five hundred in

1773
01:20:31,069 --> 01:20:35,269
China because it's got a fucking

1774
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,130
appellation on them it's it's about the

1775
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:38,990
long term and the thing is that we're in

1776
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:40,970
the beginning of a process that will go

1777
01:20:38,989 --> 01:20:43,130
on forever and so I wish that I was

1778
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:45,800
younger so I could like write this shit

1779
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:48,140
now but I know that I'm doing it for my

1780
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,820
kids so that when my children are older

1781
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:54,020
they have a farm that has a specific

1782
01:20:49,819 --> 01:20:56,119
impact because ultimately Indore is so

1783
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:58,160
simple even though there's and I argued

1784
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:59,659
about Appalachians for Indore because

1785
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:02,689
you want all cultivators to have a

1786
01:20:59,659 --> 01:21:05,389
chance to benefit but ultimately the

1787
01:21:02,689 --> 01:21:07,219
outdoor expression in his situation and

1788
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:10,670
then his hand on it combined with

1789
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:12,260
genetics is his thing and if he was the

1790
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:13,399
same as everyone else so why does he

1791
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:16,250
keep on fucking winner

1792
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:19,250
so it's it's one of those things where

1793
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:21,199
the end result answers the question it

1794
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:22,520
says that he's doing something different

1795
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:24,859
because he's running something that

1796
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:26,720
other people had that cut other people

1797
01:21:24,859 --> 01:21:29,479
use that dirt other people use

1798
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:32,510
shit but his environment coupled up with

1799
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:34,369
him and the genetics and his choices and

1800
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:36,320
how he operates makes something that's

1801
01:21:34,369 --> 01:21:40,640
absolutely exquisite

1802
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:43,279
that's the value so I actually on that

1803
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:46,490
point Chris you you you work with how

1804
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:49,939
many farms like I said currently we've

1805
01:21:46,489 --> 01:21:51,859
we've sold herb for about 120 130

1806
01:21:49,939 --> 01:21:54,679
farmers this year so far

1807
01:21:51,859 --> 01:21:58,399
so you smoke a lot of weed from a lot of

1808
01:21:54,680 --> 01:22:01,100
farmers so can you talk about something

1809
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:04,149
that maybe two different farmers grow

1810
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:06,430
the same cut that you've noticed just is

1811
01:22:04,149 --> 01:22:13,759
different based on where they're based

1812
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:16,520
can you give a concrete example you know

1813
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:19,239
not all these farmers that are using

1814
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:23,090
each other's formulas and sharing

1815
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:24,559
feeding regiments and whatnot but at the

1816
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:26,539
end of the day it's I think both of

1817
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:32,050
those things are coming into play it's

1818
01:22:26,539 --> 01:22:34,369
not just the appellation but yeah the I

1819
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:36,770
mean I don't even I can't even really

1820
01:22:34,369 --> 01:22:38,479
think of any specific examples just bump

1821
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:41,420
off the top of my head but I can tell

1822
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:43,519
you that I've seen a lot of the same

1823
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:45,699
cuts from the same nurseries growing

1824
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:48,950
different farms that come out looking

1825
01:22:45,699 --> 01:22:51,609
what a different they smell different

1826
01:22:48,949 --> 01:22:54,470
they look different they smoke different

1827
01:22:51,609 --> 01:22:56,149
so it's Appalachian I think comes into

1828
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:58,579
play what it's grown in what they were

1829
01:22:56,149 --> 01:23:00,859
sprayed with what they're fed with how

1830
01:22:58,579 --> 01:23:02,750
they cured it how long did they cure it

1831
01:23:00,859 --> 01:23:04,609
what temperature they cured it out how

1832
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:06,260
long has it been in a turkey bag was it

1833
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:08,779
in Turkey bag was it in a cardboard box

1834
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:11,390
was it in was it stored underground was

1835
01:23:08,779 --> 01:23:14,630
it stored in a garage with no insulation

1836
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:17,329
at 70 degrees there's a million things

1837
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:19,699
that come into play with when it comes

1838
01:23:17,329 --> 01:23:24,829
to what that consumer is tasting or how

1839
01:23:19,699 --> 01:23:26,869
they're feeling so yeah I've seen it all

1840
01:23:24,829 --> 01:23:29,149
over the place for sure it's super

1841
01:23:26,869 --> 01:23:33,289
interesting it's very fascinating for

1842
01:23:29,149 --> 01:23:35,029
sure yeah so that tells me that that

1843
01:23:33,289 --> 01:23:37,369
appellation is going to be really

1844
01:23:35,029 --> 01:23:39,750
difficult which we know it's going to be

1845
01:23:37,369 --> 01:23:43,859
it is and then it's going to be

1846
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:45,479
localized and really specific so Kevin

1847
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:46,979
how do you think it's gonna work out

1848
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:51,149
what do you think it's gonna look like

1849
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:53,159
on the ground at the end of the day we

1850
01:23:51,149 --> 01:23:56,489
don't we don't have the the final regs

1851
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:59,519
in play but the bottom line is that if

1852
01:23:56,489 --> 01:24:01,699
you're because what Chris was talking

1853
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:05,550
about that's all part of Appalachian to

1854
01:24:01,699 --> 01:24:08,130
Appalachian is is is location process

1855
01:24:05,550 --> 01:24:10,820
and we're part of the process but it's

1856
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:13,170
processed genetics and location and

1857
01:24:10,819 --> 01:24:16,049
processes all those things we talked

1858
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:18,560
about so say say you're in an adhesion

1859
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:21,659
and what we're saying is that our our

1860
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:24,090
curing process is longer when we take

1861
01:24:21,659 --> 01:24:26,909
more time we make sure that the plant

1862
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:29,610
the the product after cutting never goes

1863
01:24:26,909 --> 01:24:31,649
over 65 degrees so we don't flare off

1864
01:24:29,609 --> 01:24:35,279
any monos and we don't oxidize the

1865
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:37,949
product that's holding stability we talk

1866
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:40,639
about the speed that it moves through

1867
01:24:37,949 --> 01:24:43,289
the system and and how it's never

1868
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:45,900
transferred unless it's preserved in

1869
01:24:43,289 --> 01:24:47,850
quality that's the stuff that we learned

1870
01:24:45,899 --> 01:24:49,589
from all these other countries that did

1871
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:51,240
Appalachians where they figured out how

1872
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:55,350
to refine the process to look who's

1873
01:24:51,239 --> 01:24:57,479
absolutely rock tight for them and it it

1874
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:59,550
it doesn't mean that everyone is going

1875
01:24:57,479 --> 01:25:02,009
to get paid from it but what it does is

1876
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:04,470
that it creates the upper shelf you have

1877
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:06,900
to have the upper shelf because the

1878
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:08,820
higher the upper shelf it brings every

1879
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:10,229
other shelf up below it but if the top

1880
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:13,139
shelf is ten bucks

1881
01:25:10,229 --> 01:25:15,779
you fucked if you down below that but if

1882
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:17,880
the top shelf is 50 bucks there is some

1883
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:21,029
room and what it does it starts to allow

1884
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:23,340
you to create exquisite markets and then

1885
01:25:21,029 --> 01:25:24,929
normalize markets and then both markets

1886
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:27,420
because everybody deserves good grass to

1887
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:29,400
smoke but when you're talking about work

1888
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:31,739
that required an ungodly amount of

1889
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:34,289
fucking labor you're selling a Maserati

1890
01:25:31,739 --> 01:25:36,329
you're not selling a Honda they're

1891
01:25:34,289 --> 01:25:38,729
different Honda is a beautiful car - but

1892
01:25:36,329 --> 01:25:42,090
Gupta didn't stitch the leather seat in

1893
01:25:38,729 --> 01:25:45,359
it so when it comes to us with the

1894
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:47,130
Appalachian how it rolls out is is the

1895
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:48,809
boots like I like about it is that

1896
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:51,210
they're actually taking their time and

1897
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:53,460
the groups are putting arguments

1898
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:56,039
together that are trying to lessen the

1899
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:58,739
these so that it's not so expensive to

1900
01:25:56,039 --> 01:26:01,819
begin one and it's not so expensive to

1901
01:25:58,739 --> 01:26:03,899
change one and that we're creating

1902
01:26:01,819 --> 01:26:06,599
variability in the genetics that were

1903
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:09,329
using so that you're not tied into a

1904
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:11,520
specific thing because y-you had the

1905
01:26:09,329 --> 01:26:12,869
data from the monks so remember I sent

1906
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,580
you an email where I laid this whole

1907
01:26:12,869 --> 01:26:16,920
thing out and study in the shipping

1908
01:26:14,579 --> 01:26:19,079
years and I'm not an Appalachian expert

1909
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:21,779
but what I care about is how do you take

1910
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:24,390
their ideas and use it to assist us in

1911
01:26:21,779 --> 01:26:27,269
what we're doing and not follow it

1912
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:31,380
verbatim because cannabis is not wine so

1913
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:33,300
it has to have its own criterias and the

1914
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:36,359
the idea that it's something that brings

1915
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:39,720
value to regions that have historical

1916
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:41,399
relevance and that the impact is genuine

1917
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:43,829
and is like I said it creates the upper

1918
01:26:41,399 --> 01:26:46,139
shelf and it allows you to start to

1919
01:26:43,829 --> 01:26:47,850
validate outdoor cannabis in a way

1920
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:50,010
that's speeded because we know from

1921
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:51,930
consumption point of view that the

1922
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:54,480
thickest richest greasy as shit is

1923
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:56,970
coming from outdoor so indoor is a

1924
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:59,309
smoother and it is usually because of

1925
01:26:56,970 --> 01:27:01,260
that diurnal swinging temp and the fact

1926
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:03,510
that they stabilized methodology and if

1927
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:06,449
you're running it as a organic indoor

1928
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:08,670
you're getting a really premium product

1929
01:27:06,449 --> 01:27:11,429
but if it's regular salt grown it's very

1930
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:14,310
similar and so you don't have these

1931
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:17,460
subtleties and nuances as much the

1932
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:20,010
cultivator themself as influence but not

1933
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:22,770
like the specific regions within

1934
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:24,480
California than that influence and I

1935
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:26,280
think that once you start to create this

1936
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:28,259
as long as it's not too onus on the

1937
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:30,929
operator where it's too much paperwork

1938
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:33,960
and too much money then over the course

1939
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:35,940
of the next 15 20 years what you've done

1940
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:38,340
is you started to first legitimatize

1941
01:27:35,939 --> 01:27:40,199
cannabis as an ultra craft product to

1942
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:42,720
fit and all the extra lines of all the

1943
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:44,429
other craft products because everyone's

1944
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:46,680
consuming it but now you just have to

1945
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:49,920
call it that and then what it does it

1946
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:51,930
starts to create the value for all the

1947
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,550
small far more over time as long as we

1948
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:55,470
can hold our properties like that's the

1949
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:57,210
hard part for us is how do you maintain

1950
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:59,490
the land and how do you maintain the

1951
01:27:57,210 --> 01:28:02,279
family integrity to get to that point

1952
01:27:59,489 --> 01:28:03,960
where we're going to get paid and we

1953
01:28:02,279 --> 01:28:06,069
weren't paid before now we're going

1954
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:09,219
through this transition and with

1955
01:28:06,069 --> 01:28:11,078
actually okay I'm feeding my kids I'm

1956
01:28:09,219 --> 01:28:14,590
not rolling in the fucking paper like I

1957
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:16,569
used to but I'm also happier than I've

1958
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:19,840
been in a long time because I know I get

1959
01:28:16,569 --> 01:28:23,009
to go run the farm so like this is a

1960
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:25,690
busy Beauty to being legal in a way that

1961
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:27,310
it's not about you man it wasn't about

1962
01:28:25,689 --> 01:28:29,169
me tripping on the game it was that I

1963
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:31,360
looked at my kids and realized that by

1964
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:33,609
the time they get older our whole life

1965
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:36,368
will be gone and so what do we do and so

1966
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:39,250
to me the Appalachian is the key to move

1967
01:28:36,368 --> 01:28:40,929
this forward and if we just study how

1968
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:43,060
they came about it was wine where the

1969
01:28:40,929 --> 01:28:44,828
monks the monks were the ones that

1970
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:46,389
figured out the best processes and they

1971
01:28:44,828 --> 01:28:48,130
figured out the best locations because

1972
01:28:46,389 --> 01:28:50,650
they were funded by the church so they

1973
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:53,230
didn't have to get paid making wine they

1974
01:28:50,649 --> 01:28:55,238
had to have it for mass so everything

1975
01:28:53,229 --> 01:28:58,209
that we have on Great Dane is really

1976
01:28:55,238 --> 01:29:00,009
from the Franciscans and so they figured

1977
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:01,750
out where everything knew best and how

1978
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:03,550
it grew best and what was the impact of

1979
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:06,849
the soil and the air and the environment

1980
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:08,829
and the elevation on that grapevine we

1981
01:29:06,849 --> 01:29:10,719
don't have that amount of data but begin

1982
01:29:08,828 --> 01:29:12,609
in it and that's that's the point is

1983
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:14,560
that it has to just be flexible enough

1984
01:29:12,609 --> 01:29:17,948
to let you get involved without too much

1985
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:19,840
money flexible rules to begin so that

1986
01:29:17,948 --> 01:29:22,388
it's not too exclusionary from the

1987
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:24,819
beginning and then have an ability over

1988
01:29:22,389 --> 01:29:27,099
time to adjust and refine so then fits

1989
01:29:24,819 --> 01:29:29,019
the needs of the farming community and

1990
01:29:27,099 --> 01:29:34,179
the customer and now you got some real

1991
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:38,980
shit so isn't it like Jason has that

1992
01:29:34,179 --> 01:29:42,158
information but innately like yes he has

1993
01:29:38,979 --> 01:29:43,899
it intuitively intuition right intuition

1994
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:45,670
which is it which man I went to Russia

1995
01:29:43,899 --> 01:29:47,500
with my son right my sons a world-class

1996
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:50,199
weightlifter so I get invited to Russia

1997
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:53,078
to go to the Russian Sports Institute to

1998
01:29:50,198 --> 01:29:54,759
get him studied and I'm at the Sports

1999
01:29:53,078 --> 01:29:56,289
Institute the fucking smarter sports

2000
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:58,060
scientists in the world and they're

2001
01:29:56,289 --> 01:30:00,340
filming this athlete I said what are you

2002
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:02,380
filming him for he goes we're trying to

2003
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:04,029
understand what he does so that we can

2004
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:06,819
explain to other people how they should

2005
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:08,559
do it and I said you can't create that

2006
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:11,309
and they said no we can never create

2007
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:13,929
what we do is we analyze research

2008
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:16,619
determine how they did it and try to get

2009
01:30:13,929 --> 01:30:17,770
someone else to copy because ultimately

2010
01:30:16,618 --> 01:30:20,019
Cree

2011
01:30:17,770 --> 01:30:21,880
in his creation that's the art and

2012
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:23,740
that's really what I think like Jason

2013
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:25,390
and a lot of the guys Chris worked with

2014
01:30:23,739 --> 01:30:27,489
an including Chris own situation he's

2015
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:28,960
intuitive isn't intuitive Khosla because

2016
01:30:27,489 --> 01:30:29,619
that's he's building his business by

2017
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,779
himself

2018
01:30:29,619 --> 01:30:33,849
so that's intuition and that's I think

2019
01:30:31,779 --> 01:30:36,550
it's imperative to put that out because

2020
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:38,410
all young cultivators all young artisans

2021
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:40,630
and all crafts have to realize that if

2022
01:30:38,409 --> 01:30:43,840
you feel like you got a skill when you

2023
01:30:40,630 --> 01:30:46,390
touch it it's genuine chase that shit

2024
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,310
because that's the brain and your body

2025
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:51,940
fucking tied into your spirit and that's

2026
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:57,340
where Wonder comes out and that kind of

2027
01:30:51,939 --> 01:30:59,500
stuff it it's valuable to him because

2028
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:02,590
his location and his ability and his

2029
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:04,869
choices make that value so that when it

2030
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:06,970
does it allows us to kids down the road

2031
01:31:04,869 --> 01:31:09,849
to be able to have real estate that has

2032
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:12,100
a value so that they have security they

2033
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:14,170
have heritage you know we don't pass

2034
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:16,450
anything down anymore in society

2035
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:18,390
nobody's passing skillsets from

2036
01:31:16,449 --> 01:31:21,789
generation to generation and

2037
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:24,310
appellations you look at these farms in

2038
01:31:21,789 --> 01:31:26,260
in Italy in France is stuff you're

2039
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:28,120
talking four hundred years of people

2040
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:29,860
passing a farm down do you know what the

2041
01:31:28,119 --> 01:31:33,789
most profitable fucking business on

2042
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:37,839
earth is per person is a winery in

2043
01:31:33,789 --> 01:31:40,180
France and they're generating office 600

2044
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:42,789
acres over a billion dollars with like a

2045
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:44,890
hundred and twenty five people that's

2046
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:46,689
the best of most bowl and a slough

2047
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:49,300
cretons business on the planet for that

2048
01:31:46,689 --> 01:31:50,619
number of people working it so when

2049
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:52,690
someone says this ship doesn't have a

2050
01:31:50,619 --> 01:31:54,939
value at that opposite extreme it most

2051
01:31:52,689 --> 01:31:57,129
definitely does and we may not have the

2052
01:31:54,939 --> 01:32:01,179
ability to produce six hundred acres in

2053
01:31:57,130 --> 01:32:04,359
that form but in our niche markets we do

2054
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:06,039
and once you start to get the public to

2055
01:32:04,359 --> 01:32:09,099
understand what's produced they can

2056
01:32:06,039 --> 01:32:11,500
start to put in orders and you have tree

2057
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:13,660
buys we even have auctions on the

2058
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:15,640
batches so that when you have a vintage

2059
01:32:13,659 --> 01:32:17,619
year when the when the when the

2060
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:20,350
Assessors come in and say these are

2061
01:32:17,619 --> 01:32:22,659
primo crops you start to get bids I

2062
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:24,039
don't think anybody has any idea what

2063
01:32:22,659 --> 01:32:26,619
possibly were people are talking about

2064
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:28,029
$2.00 grass and I'm like in the wrong

2065
01:32:26,619 --> 01:32:29,840
fucking business you're not selling

2066
01:32:28,029 --> 01:32:35,059
Timex watches

2067
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:36,469
Rolex watches so just quickly I asked if

2068
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:38,539
people have questions and then it

2069
01:32:36,469 --> 01:32:39,948
exploded so let me start catching up for

2070
01:32:38,539 --> 01:32:43,279
these questions but the one that

2071
01:32:39,948 --> 01:32:44,719
everyone wants an answer to is Kevin so

2072
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:46,579
everyone's basically asking can you ask

2073
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:50,510
Kevin if in Skunk projects is still in

2074
01:32:46,579 --> 01:32:54,289
the works it is it's still in the works

2075
01:32:50,510 --> 01:32:56,570
and a couple times what I did is I I had

2076
01:32:54,289 --> 01:32:59,960
gotten ill a couple years back and I

2077
01:32:56,569 --> 01:33:00,829
just didn't expect that the I was out

2078
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,719
when I was in a coma

2079
01:33:00,829 --> 01:33:05,210
but I didn't expect that it was going to

2080
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:06,800
fuck me up so badly and slow me down and

2081
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:08,658
I couldn't really do I could go to work

2082
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,150
but I couldn't do all my extracurricular

2083
01:33:08,658 --> 01:33:13,098
projects and by the time I kind of got

2084
01:33:11,149 --> 01:33:15,559
healed back like this was two years ago

2085
01:33:13,099 --> 01:33:18,829
so - I feel great now but man it was

2086
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:20,929
like I had aged like 115 years and I

2087
01:33:18,829 --> 01:33:22,670
couldn't move the project forward I just

2088
01:33:20,929 --> 01:33:25,429
sat with all the material and I kept

2089
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:27,739
everything alive but by the time I get

2090
01:33:25,429 --> 01:33:30,980
back to being healthy I'm in a new

2091
01:33:27,738 --> 01:33:32,988
business model with my operation and so

2092
01:33:30,979 --> 01:33:34,698
what I did is I took all the genetics

2093
01:33:32,988 --> 01:33:36,319
all the seed stock all the parental

2094
01:33:34,698 --> 01:33:38,598
stock and I licensed it to another

2095
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:41,479
company that I'm connected to so that I

2096
01:33:38,599 --> 01:33:43,400
can have them do the actual sifting work

2097
01:33:41,479 --> 01:33:45,529
and breeding on it and then I can go in

2098
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:48,339
and help them with selection because on

2099
01:33:45,529 --> 01:33:56,269
the inside what's that which company

2100
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:59,029
don't you want to know me to be able to

2101
01:33:56,270 --> 01:34:02,090
utilize their operations that are larger

2102
01:33:59,029 --> 01:34:04,130
to do the sifting and the hunting but

2103
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:05,989
otherwise it was going to have to keep

2104
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:07,969
sitting on the weight and I thought I

2105
01:34:05,988 --> 01:34:09,738
was going to get to use the farm but

2106
01:34:07,969 --> 01:34:11,090
when you start to run your numbers on

2107
01:34:09,738 --> 01:34:12,618
the farm and you find out how much you

2108
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:14,329
make really working on the farm you

2109
01:34:12,618 --> 01:34:17,329
realize that every square foot you farm

2110
01:34:14,329 --> 01:34:20,448
has to be operational so all the way I

2111
01:34:17,329 --> 01:34:22,488
behaved for decades which was R&amp;D all

2112
01:34:20,448 --> 01:34:24,829
over the place and testing shit running

2113
01:34:22,488 --> 01:34:26,839
shit once we get into this new system

2114
01:34:24,829 --> 01:34:30,079
it's a fucking tracking nightmare and

2115
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:32,929
it's also financially impossible on your

2116
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:35,210
farm to play hunt and chase when you're

2117
01:34:32,929 --> 01:34:37,250
having to tag and identify every one of

2118
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:39,829
these plants that have been bashed and

2119
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:41,179
it's a fucking nightmare and so I just

2120
01:34:39,829 --> 01:34:43,309
said hang on so it's not going anywhere

2121
01:34:41,179 --> 01:34:44,750
and I'm not tripping because old

2122
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:46,820
I wasn't trying to be first to the

2123
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:49,399
market I just knew that I could access

2124
01:34:46,819 --> 01:34:51,199
material that I had myself and I knew

2125
01:34:49,399 --> 01:34:52,909
that when I threw some feelers out into

2126
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:55,550
the world to see if did anybody have any

2127
01:34:52,909 --> 01:34:57,859
stock from the late 70s I was able to

2128
01:34:55,550 --> 01:34:59,630
get it when we tried to open those seeds

2129
01:34:57,859 --> 01:35:02,089
up a couple years ago the technology

2130
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:03,680
wasn't refined enough and so we opened

2131
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:06,890
them government pop we still didn't get

2132
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:08,990
them to extend so now the hormonal basis

2133
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:10,670
is better and I know we're going to be

2134
01:35:08,989 --> 01:35:12,380
able to do some good embryo rescue on

2135
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:14,659
and start to pull some of this old stock

2136
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:17,329
that I acquired because it wasn't just a

2137
01:35:14,659 --> 01:35:18,829
hunt the you know the road killer but

2138
01:35:17,329 --> 01:35:22,340
he's obsessed with roadkill but like it

2139
01:35:18,829 --> 01:35:25,010
was to hunt and era because like when I

2140
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:28,880
got to California in I'm gonna get

2141
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:30,829
California 87 that was this it was just

2142
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:32,630
so much good pie and it was all coming

2143
01:35:30,829 --> 01:35:34,539
from all over the place but it was just

2144
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:37,909
rich and diverse and interesting and

2145
01:35:34,539 --> 01:35:40,039
it's it's my roots that's my heritage

2146
01:35:37,909 --> 01:35:41,779
strains and so that was the whole

2147
01:35:40,039 --> 01:35:43,600
purpose of the project was to pull this

2148
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:46,849
stuff out and it'll happen but

2149
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:49,100
legalization kind of slowed down the

2150
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:52,340
ability to use the tools like I used to

2151
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:54,860
use and then I unfortunately got really

2152
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:57,650
ill and almost fucking diagnostic so

2153
01:35:54,859 --> 01:35:59,479
it's it's it's there it's just not being

2154
01:35:57,649 --> 01:36:02,059
able to be focused on on the forefront

2155
01:35:59,479 --> 01:36:03,949
right now I think everyone was happy

2156
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,880
with that answer so getting back to what

2157
01:36:03,949 --> 01:36:08,559
we're just talking about with

2158
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:11,690
Appalachians or relevance Appalachians

2159
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:14,240
for all three of you so this is from Don

2160
01:36:11,689 --> 01:36:17,349
Jose how long does it take to adjust a

2161
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:19,909
strain to a specific area environment so

2162
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:21,560
Jason can you talk about some genetics

2163
01:36:19,909 --> 01:36:25,609
you've run and maybe something you've

2164
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:27,770
noticed like three years into running

2165
01:36:25,609 --> 01:36:42,109
something versus the first year of

2166
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:43,880
running that okay interrupt that one

2167
01:36:42,109 --> 01:36:46,479
second because I wanted to go back to

2168
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:51,109
where he's just talking about the Rd and

2169
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:53,149
me and my dad we love you know cross

2170
01:36:51,109 --> 01:36:54,380
pollinating making strains I mean that's

2171
01:36:53,149 --> 01:36:56,319
one of our favorite things to do

2172
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:58,359
together and

2173
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:00,130
I have some you know amazing genetics

2174
01:36:58,359 --> 01:37:02,799
I've took the green lantern I've crossed

2175
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:06,730
it into these og you want these strains

2176
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:09,070
these ice cream cake strains other

2177
01:37:06,729 --> 01:37:10,809
fruity strains and I want a girl more Oh

2178
01:37:09,069 --> 01:37:12,238
I mean I've even popped a bunch of the

2179
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:14,409
seeds and now I'm sitting there going

2180
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:17,709
you know where I put them you know I

2181
01:37:14,408 --> 01:37:20,559
could only plant six six plants for my

2182
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:22,149
personal so you know like you said it's

2183
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:24,280
like there's so much out there we want

2184
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:25,868
to try but you almost have to leave it

2185
01:37:24,279 --> 01:37:29,559
for those people that are dedicating

2186
01:37:25,868 --> 01:37:31,059
their full space to that and then I

2187
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:34,900
wanted to go to the Appalachians real

2188
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:38,110
quick just because I felt like I've been

2189
01:37:34,899 --> 01:37:40,238
in Appalachian forever as a kid from

2190
01:37:38,109 --> 01:37:42,719
humble he's you know I've been lucky

2191
01:37:40,238 --> 01:37:45,009
enough to travel a good amount

2192
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,539
everywhere I've ever gone if I well you

2193
01:37:45,010 --> 01:37:48,639
know were you from homo County oh you

2194
01:37:46,539 --> 01:37:52,090
grow wheat and yeah that's what all I've

2195
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:54,520
been told my whole life and so you know

2196
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:58,810
when you know I've been offered honestly

2197
01:37:54,520 --> 01:38:02,110
by places in Santa Barbara you know to

2198
01:37:58,810 --> 01:38:04,869
grow Ridgeline hey we'll do a few acres

2199
01:38:02,109 --> 01:38:09,039
of light depth for you you know I'm like

2200
01:38:04,868 --> 01:38:11,979
no I mean I want Humboldt County on my

2201
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:14,948
brand you know where I'm from I don't

2202
01:38:11,979 --> 01:38:18,129
want you know somebody to buy my smoked

2203
01:38:14,948 --> 01:38:20,198
that's grown and Santa Barbara or you

2204
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:23,020
know Salinas or whatever in another

2205
01:38:20,198 --> 01:38:24,698
another area so I feel like the

2206
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:26,409
appellation thing is pretty real and

2207
01:38:24,698 --> 01:38:30,098
like I said I feel like we already are

2208
01:38:26,408 --> 01:38:32,769
in our appellation and I want homel

2209
01:38:30,099 --> 01:38:35,619
County to be on every package you know

2210
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:38,530
produced in Allentown tea that I sent

2211
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:41,139
out there to consumers getting back to

2212
01:38:38,529 --> 01:38:45,219
the question you asked that's a hard one

2213
01:38:41,139 --> 01:38:47,260
I mean I guess I'm figuring out right

2214
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:50,649
now I'm growing a bunch of strains that

2215
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:53,440
I personally only seen endure you know

2216
01:38:50,649 --> 01:38:55,328
I've only seen us so I'm gonna know a

2217
01:38:53,439 --> 01:38:58,419
lot more I mean hopefully to get back to

2218
01:38:55,328 --> 01:39:00,069
this after this first you know season

2219
01:38:58,420 --> 01:39:02,560
problem or this first round you know

2220
01:39:00,069 --> 01:39:05,939
late July and I'll know what these

2221
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:09,400
strains are doing I feel like if you are

2222
01:39:05,939 --> 01:39:09,909
you know a good grower you know you're

2223
01:39:09,399 --> 01:39:11,589
doing

2224
01:39:09,909 --> 01:39:13,989
you're gonna grow good herb no matter

2225
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:16,720
what but you know like I said every

2226
01:39:13,989 --> 01:39:19,119
strain is completely different and you

2227
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:22,720
you do have to learn a strain you have

2228
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:25,840
to learn its tendencies some mold some

2229
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:28,240
grow way faster and others some like

2230
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:31,810
more nitrogen so you know they all are

2231
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:38,460
different I don't know a specific strain

2232
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:42,370
it can really put my finger on that yeah

2233
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:43,840
you know it was easier before a climate

2234
01:39:42,369 --> 01:39:45,819
change started to becoming more

2235
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,650
aggressive because like what Don Carlos

2236
01:39:45,819 --> 01:39:48,909
is asking is it's like how long does it

2237
01:39:47,649 --> 01:39:50,589
take for them for the plant to

2238
01:39:48,909 --> 01:39:53,199
acclimatize to a region because

2239
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:55,360
epigenetically that the plant is plastic

2240
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:59,229
in its genome which means it can

2241
01:39:55,359 --> 01:40:01,479
suddenly adjust suddenly gently' adjust

2242
01:39:59,229 --> 01:40:03,639
over time to fit the environment better

2243
01:40:01,479 --> 01:40:05,859
because it's an organism that wants to

2244
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:10,270
survive just like your your body is a

2245
01:40:05,859 --> 01:40:12,369
plastic living body that the genes can

2246
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:15,010
modify and move so that you're able to

2247
01:40:12,369 --> 01:40:17,439
constantly pick up information and that

2248
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:19,900
way you pass that information downstream

2249
01:40:17,439 --> 01:40:21,460
so when people talk about reading

2250
01:40:19,899 --> 01:40:24,069
projects you know you're looking for a

2251
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:26,439
large chunk of time because every year

2252
01:40:24,069 --> 01:40:30,009
that you read you chose the best ship

2253
01:40:26,439 --> 01:40:31,719
that survived that season so it picked

2254
01:40:30,010 --> 01:40:34,210
up the genetic information of

2255
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:36,430
survivability for each one of those

2256
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:37,899
years and when you have a gene pool you

2257
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:39,159
know within the gene pool you have

2258
01:40:37,899 --> 01:40:43,239
something that's going to make it and

2259
01:40:39,159 --> 01:40:44,800
with and it used to be like just even a

2260
01:40:43,239 --> 01:40:46,389
few years back remember we had the

2261
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,860
drought right so there was like five or

2262
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:49,750
six years where you weren't getting rain

2263
01:40:47,859 --> 01:40:52,149
until like fucking December and humble

2264
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:54,220
and so anybody that was doing

2265
01:40:52,149 --> 01:40:55,839
developmental work during that time for

2266
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:58,150
Humboldt County built things that

2267
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:00,610
finished way later than they should and

2268
01:40:58,149 --> 01:41:02,460
now you're going into a situation where

2269
01:41:00,609 --> 01:41:05,679
we're getting rain again come November

2270
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:07,239
or you should get it back in and the

2271
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:09,240
development of things that went along

2272
01:41:07,239 --> 01:41:12,069
that timeframe and no longer applicable

2273
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:13,929
so I think when it comes down to is if

2274
01:41:12,069 --> 01:41:16,929
you're trying to develop stability in a

2275
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:20,079
line in an area it's really a measure of

2276
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:22,810
time from swings so you need to take a

2277
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:23,710
look at what you're working at now in

2278
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:25,780
terms of environment

2279
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:27,279
we then go back X amount of years to

2280
01:41:25,779 --> 01:41:28,840
when you began and you'd be able to get

2281
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:32,679
an idea of what did you do your

2282
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:34,029
development in environmentally and I

2283
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:36,130
don't so I don't think there's a set

2284
01:41:34,029 --> 01:41:39,099
answer of like you know three runs and

2285
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:40,600
it's acclimated seventy two generations

2286
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:44,530
of reading and it's good it's really

2287
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:46,390
about selection and desire for the

2288
01:41:44,529 --> 01:41:49,359
market combined with what worked

2289
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:52,150
environmentally a lot of work being a

2290
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:54,099
breeder two minutes oh hey it takes so

2291
01:41:52,149 --> 01:41:55,569
much time I mean I guess if you want to

2292
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:57,880
take plants and throw them in door and

2293
01:41:55,569 --> 01:42:01,119
make them be their thing quit but I mean

2294
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:03,069
it's you know it for me it's a year you

2295
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:06,130
know every time a lot strain is okay

2296
01:42:03,069 --> 01:42:09,399
well extra yeah this one is near that

2297
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:11,079
Supergirl that my dad has you know it's

2298
01:42:09,399 --> 01:42:12,639
I don't even know this house train wreck

2299
01:42:11,079 --> 01:42:14,319
in it he's been doing since you know we

2300
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:17,140
were all grown train wreck so what does

2301
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:19,988
that fifteen twenty years ago and now he

2302
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:22,420
has it for its finishing you know at the

2303
01:42:19,988 --> 01:42:25,179
end of August early September you know

2304
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:27,969
so just like you say but it's not really

2305
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:30,550
a strain it's more of us evolving the

2306
01:42:27,969 --> 01:42:34,329
strain you know with the climate but you

2307
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:36,159
say it so yeah it's it's a lot of work

2308
01:42:34,329 --> 01:42:38,559
that's why it's nice you know I mean I

2309
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:42,039
like that's one of my favorite things to

2310
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:44,130
do is you know breed is is being a

2311
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:48,069
breeder but now like you said we have to

2312
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:49,569
we have our square footage and the more

2313
01:42:48,069 --> 01:42:51,309
strange you put in the greenhouse with

2314
01:42:49,569 --> 01:42:55,899
all the metric and all the paperwork

2315
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:58,840
it's headache yeah it's a nightmare and

2316
01:42:55,899 --> 01:43:02,859
a batch testing oh it's gnarly but

2317
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:06,699
that's why you know kind of I want to

2318
01:43:02,859 --> 01:43:08,738
see what strains are gonna come out the

2319
01:43:06,699 --> 01:43:10,510
best in our area so yes I'm taking a

2320
01:43:08,738 --> 01:43:13,238
risk right now growing so many different

2321
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:15,310
strains like we know you know a lot of

2322
01:43:13,238 --> 01:43:19,238
them growing they've proven themselves

2323
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:22,270
indoor time and time again I guarantee I

2324
01:43:19,238 --> 01:43:23,859
could probably I guess I can't guarantee

2325
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:26,500
that because you know they're endure

2326
01:43:23,859 --> 01:43:28,809
strange but I know I'm gonna grow them

2327
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:31,000
pretty damn good and we will see they

2328
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:32,260
don't come out good it won't grow them

2329
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,939
again we don't know what they're gonna

2330
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:37,610
they're gonna react in this climate we

2331
01:43:33,939 --> 01:43:40,429
have you know today today is 85

2332
01:43:37,609 --> 01:43:46,789
100 tomorrow's g5 and we're gonna get it

2333
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:56,390
into rain so this is an indoor facility

2334
01:43:46,789 --> 01:43:59,000
in Arizona is the the kind of global

2335
01:43:56,390 --> 01:44:01,460
warming weather stuff going on really

2336
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,859
affecting you guys right now like is it

2337
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:06,140
just all over the place in terms of like

2338
01:44:03,859 --> 01:44:07,519
you you used to have predictability I

2339
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:10,340
mean obviously you'd have something

2340
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:13,160
happen in a season that was unexpected

2341
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:14,690
but you had expectations it seems like

2342
01:44:13,159 --> 01:44:21,590
now you just don't know what to expect

2343
01:44:14,689 --> 01:44:25,460
every single year I mean really we grill

2344
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:29,029
full-term plants in the summer full-term

2345
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:32,060
we go indoor in the winter and yeah you

2346
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:34,460
know Dex really only came around I don't

2347
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:38,539
know what you think 10 years ago I mean

2348
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:41,119
really fully started hitting so yeah I

2349
01:44:38,539 --> 01:44:47,269
mean it was just kind of the way it was

2350
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:49,340
a 20 20 years one thing it's a you know

2351
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:51,680
that was her life is this that we would

2352
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:54,590
just always it was full-term plants we

2353
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:58,520
grow all summer long and then the winter

2354
01:44:54,590 --> 01:45:02,720
comes you'd go inside so yeah it's the

2355
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:04,160
weather is completely unpredictable the

2356
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:06,350
almanacs on it said it's gonna be a

2357
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:08,149
wetter May but you know we did like I

2358
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:10,910
said last year we've got a whole nother

2359
01:45:08,149 --> 01:45:12,829
run it it didn't rain forever it was you

2360
01:45:10,909 --> 01:45:15,670
know we're into October there's no rain

2361
01:45:12,829 --> 01:45:19,279
yeah I mean the year before we had a

2362
01:45:15,670 --> 01:45:22,369
gnarliest storm ever and we had weed

2363
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:25,009
molding everywhere so you know working

2364
01:45:22,369 --> 01:45:28,220
with the climate is a whole different

2365
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:31,699
game but at the same time working with

2366
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:34,460
the Sun and the vironment weed is I mean

2367
01:45:31,699 --> 01:45:36,529
it's way better I guarantee it's you

2368
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:38,210
know it's getting the teenage seeds

2369
01:45:36,529 --> 01:45:39,859
gonna be higher it's I mean just

2370
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:45,340
everything about some girl weed is

2371
01:45:39,859 --> 01:45:47,509
better so I just want to say that as a

2372
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:50,140
consumerist and a patient which is

2373
01:45:47,510 --> 01:45:51,550
always how I'm experiencing these

2374
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:55,070
conversations

2375
01:45:51,550 --> 01:45:58,579
what I want to hear in order to make

2376
01:45:55,069 --> 01:46:01,429
that bridge be a successful one to get

2377
01:45:58,578 --> 01:46:04,099
from here to there so everyone survives

2378
01:46:01,429 --> 01:46:06,859
and there there is what I've heard today

2379
01:46:04,099 --> 01:46:09,619
I can't even begin to tell you that

2380
01:46:06,859 --> 01:46:13,189
Jason in particular because you're here

2381
01:46:09,618 --> 01:46:15,139
is able to integrate everything all

2382
01:46:13,189 --> 01:46:16,819
breathable this fucking shit you have to

2383
01:46:15,139 --> 01:46:19,520
go through the regulations and the

2384
01:46:16,819 --> 01:46:22,038
metric and this integrate that into what

2385
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:24,710
you've been doing traditional and

2386
01:46:22,038 --> 01:46:27,679
otherwise and now legal and still

2387
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:31,010
maintain the integrity of your process

2388
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:35,719
as a consumer who does care that the

2389
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:39,440
product is clean and only cares about a

2390
01:46:35,719 --> 01:46:42,469
future that has craft cannabis in it

2391
01:46:39,439 --> 01:46:46,729
right I like I like all cannabis but

2392
01:46:42,469 --> 01:46:48,920
that's the future that matters right and

2393
01:46:46,729 --> 01:46:51,408
the business model is there if you can

2394
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:53,420
make the bridge right direct to consumer

2395
01:46:51,408 --> 01:46:56,058
and all of that that's what I want to

2396
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:57,828
hear that's exactly what I wanted to

2397
01:46:56,059 --> 01:47:00,409
hear that you're able to maintain that

2398
01:46:57,828 --> 01:47:03,019
so I just went with that like they said

2399
01:47:00,408 --> 01:47:05,328
slow and steady wins the race you know

2400
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:07,909
there's been there's so many people

2401
01:47:05,328 --> 01:47:10,609
moving in and they want to just throw

2402
01:47:07,908 --> 01:47:13,158
tons of money and build out and do all

2403
01:47:10,609 --> 01:47:16,908
this crazy stuff and they have no idea

2404
01:47:13,158 --> 01:47:20,000
about growing and you know and elements

2405
01:47:16,908 --> 01:47:21,859
and the climates and you know I I'm not

2406
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,738
trying to go crazy

2407
01:47:21,859 --> 01:47:29,179
I just keep focusing on what I'm doing

2408
01:47:24,738 --> 01:47:30,589
and you know I'm proud of what I do you

2409
01:47:29,179 --> 01:47:32,270
know there's there's always gonna be

2410
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:34,639
Coors and bud

2411
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:36,920
Budweiser Coors Light Budweiser but then

2412
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:38,300

01:48:00,198 --> 01:48:04,698
to you know go out and smoke a nice

2425
01:48:03,078 --> 01:48:05,988
joint at the end of the evening and just

2426
01:48:04,698 --> 01:48:08,448
feel

2427
01:48:05,988 --> 01:48:11,328
you know you can feel the difference of

2428
01:48:08,448 --> 01:48:13,609
a nice fresh outdoor but I mean some

2429
01:48:11,328 --> 01:48:15,319
people some people like to drink Opus

2430
01:48:13,609 --> 01:48:19,069
one some people like to drink France

2431
01:48:15,319 --> 01:48:21,198
yeah there you go yeah am i feeling

2432
01:48:19,069 --> 01:48:23,118
about this is selfish man you've got the

2433
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:27,319
knowledge you have the genetics you have

2434
01:48:23,118 --> 01:48:29,118
the things we want to survive we're

2435
01:48:27,319 --> 01:48:30,880
blessed man I'll tell you what you know

2436
01:48:29,118 --> 01:48:34,460
I mean especially with this whole

2437
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:37,519
lockdown thing we got people tuning in

2438
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:39,260
from around the world there are a lot of

2439
01:48:37,519 --> 01:48:41,030
people saying it's 9:00 a.m. and they're

2440
01:48:39,260 --> 01:49:02,030
waking and baking watching this and they

2441
01:48:41,029 --> 01:49:06,948
appreciate it so so safer 9 ask any

2442
01:49:02,029 --> 01:49:12,529
experience with rebadging Kevin have you

2443
01:49:06,948 --> 01:49:14,149
done a lot of reading and what you're

2444
01:49:12,529 --> 01:49:16,429
going to find is the more determinate

2445
01:49:14,149 --> 01:49:19,038
the plant wants to fly where the harder

2446
01:49:16,429 --> 01:49:22,940
it is to pull it back so determinate the

2447
01:49:19,038 --> 01:49:25,038
flower is always upper latitude plants

2448
01:49:22,939 --> 01:49:27,319
so stuff is equatorial stuff this long

2449
01:49:25,038 --> 01:49:29,328
flower and Hayes's and Cambodians a shit

2450
01:49:27,319 --> 01:49:31,670
like that that will come back relatively

2451
01:49:29,328 --> 01:49:34,099
easily because it's almost always in a

2452
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:36,288
semi vegetative state but if it's

2453
01:49:34,099 --> 01:49:38,179
something like a broadleaf man actually

2454
01:49:36,288 --> 01:49:39,649
takes time and so what I would do for

2455
01:49:38,179 --> 01:49:41,480
people is I go up to the hill and they

2456
01:49:39,649 --> 01:49:43,819
say look we screw this out as a seed

2457
01:49:41,479 --> 01:49:45,618
this fucking plant supernatural we don't

2458
01:49:43,819 --> 01:49:47,328
know what to do with it and so instead

2459
01:49:45,618 --> 01:49:49,158
of trying to clone the flowers which

2460
01:49:47,328 --> 01:49:50,960
works sometimes but a lot of times you

2461
01:49:49,158 --> 01:49:53,558
end up rotting it in the Train it

2462
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:56,868
doesn't work you take it like you know

2463
01:49:53,559 --> 01:49:59,090
40% of the canopy go off and then I dig

2464
01:49:56,868 --> 01:50:01,939
up the plant put it in a burlap fucking

2465
01:49:59,090 --> 01:50:04,880
bag like a tree and then you bring it

2466
01:50:01,939 --> 01:50:07,638
into a indoor and set that thing off

2467
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:09,739
under 24-hour light because you have to

2468
01:50:07,639 --> 01:50:12,618
be able to get that hormonal reversal to

2469
01:50:09,738 --> 01:50:14,299
go back into juvenility and all you got

2470
01:50:12,618 --> 01:50:16,279
to do is as it dries out just don't

2471
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:18,019
overly feed it with heavy nitrogen just

2472
01:50:16,279 --> 01:50:19,819
enough so that it's in a positive so you

2473
01:50:18,019 --> 01:50:22,310
you're if you're

2474
01:50:19,819 --> 01:50:25,069
if you were driving it through a PK push

2475
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:26,690
in the finished flower you need to reset

2476
01:50:25,069 --> 01:50:30,859
that and go back into a higher nitrogen

2477
01:50:26,689 --> 01:50:32,449
level and be patient and I've had plants

2478
01:50:30,859 --> 01:50:34,939
take up to almost five and a half months

2479
01:50:32,449 --> 01:50:36,349
to revenge and people would come in they

2480
01:50:34,939 --> 01:50:37,639
see this ugliest-looking thing you ever

2481
01:50:36,350 --> 01:50:39,560
seen in your life because all the bugs

2482
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:41,000
are rotting off basically and dry and

2483
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:43,610
falling out and then all the new

2484
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:45,380
helicopters come out and so the point is

2485
01:50:43,609 --> 01:50:47,389
that if it's valuable enough take your

2486
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:49,819
time and be patient it doesn't happen

2487
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:51,410
overnight if it wants to turn quickly

2488
01:50:49,819 --> 01:50:53,539
you can do it in a month and you can

2489
01:50:51,409 --> 01:50:55,369
pull a cart off but like I said I had a

2490
01:50:53,539 --> 01:50:57,769
I had to kill a plant I got out of

2491
01:50:55,369 --> 01:50:59,840
somebody from another location that was

2492
01:50:57,770 --> 01:51:01,610
phenomenal and I held it for him but it

2493
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:05,000
took me over five months to be measured

2494
01:51:01,609 --> 01:51:06,979
so I rather keep copies of the plants

2495
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,779
that I'm testing and clonal form to make

2496
01:51:06,979 --> 01:51:10,759
it easy but sometimes you know you just

2497
01:51:08,779 --> 01:51:11,840
one of them things you run a plan it

2498
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,860
turns out to be the best thing you have

2499
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:15,110
seen in your life

2500
01:51:12,859 --> 01:51:17,599
don't fucking smoke it take the top

2501
01:51:15,109 --> 01:51:20,029
forty percent off the rest of the plant

2502
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:21,680
dig it up with the shovel and get two or

2503
01:51:20,029 --> 01:51:23,689
three your friends to put it into a root

2504
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:26,060
bag and then tie it up like a tree and

2505
01:51:23,689 --> 01:51:27,949
bring that shit into a building and set

2506
01:51:26,060 --> 01:51:29,600
it up it's worth the time because

2507
01:51:27,949 --> 01:51:32,119
ultimately like with with what we're

2508
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:33,560
doing all of us have seen herb that's so

2509
01:51:32,119 --> 01:51:35,029
much better than Eddie the herb was

2510
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:40,100
smoking right now we don't have it

2511
01:51:35,029 --> 01:51:42,019
anymore a lot of these newer strains are

2512
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:47,990
so unstable that you know I mean the

2513
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:50,000
seed strains we have there's a little

2514
01:51:47,989 --> 01:51:55,670
light show and or just a little weather

2515
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:58,010
change also they'll hurt me out they're

2516
01:51:55,670 --> 01:52:01,640
not proven but revenge is something that

2517
01:51:58,010 --> 01:52:05,690
you can do just by patient and 24-hour

2518
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:07,910
light not excessive food levels it's

2519
01:52:05,689 --> 01:52:09,199
normal let it slowly come back over time

2520
01:52:07,909 --> 01:52:11,779
because really what you have to do is

2521
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:13,729
going home oil change yeah

2522
01:52:11,779 --> 01:52:15,409
hormonal shift is though is the key part

2523
01:52:13,729 --> 01:52:19,849
you want to get to get it back to come

2524
01:52:15,409 --> 01:52:22,760
from senescence the juvenility following

2525
01:52:19,850 --> 01:52:26,120
up on on what kevin was talking about

2526
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:28,400
about future consumers being like coming

2527
01:52:26,119 --> 01:52:31,939
from the vape world does that mean that

2528
01:52:28,399 --> 01:52:33,409
maybe they might be like into sauces and

2529
01:52:31,939 --> 01:52:35,599
hash and

2530
01:52:33,409 --> 01:52:40,309
concentrates things like that so I'm

2531
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:42,770
curious Jason I didn't do you grow for

2532
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:45,740
hash for other stuff is that a part of

2533
01:52:42,770 --> 01:52:47,690
what you're doing as well well you know

2534
01:52:45,739 --> 01:52:52,429
if I definitely did some fresh frozen

2535
01:52:47,689 --> 01:52:55,929
last year it was amazing I used some of

2536
01:52:52,430 --> 01:52:57,950
my smalls this year we did some sauce to

2537
01:52:55,930 --> 01:52:59,270
Humboldt brand that turned out really

2538
01:52:57,949 --> 01:53:02,359
really good

2539
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:03,950
I definitely don't grow for that you

2540
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:05,839
know I like I said I take a little

2541
01:53:03,949 --> 01:53:07,909
amount you know maybe to enter the

2542
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:11,360
Emerald cup maybe so I could actually

2543
01:53:07,909 --> 01:53:14,149
have some personal smoke and for me and

2544
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:16,099
my friends or whatnot but uh you know

2545
01:53:14,149 --> 01:53:18,829
like you said this malt could do

2546
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:20,420
anything they're versatile you don't get

2547
01:53:18,829 --> 01:53:24,260
that much for them and I definitely

2548
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:27,020
don't want them going to my jars so yeah

2549
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:29,750
I don't go for it but I definitely enjoy

2550
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:31,580
you know I'm good with about one dab in

2551
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:33,500
the evening you know right before dinner

2552
01:53:31,579 --> 01:53:35,470
I'm not I'm not wanted is hit him all

2553
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:38,270
the time I like smoking joints man

2554
01:53:35,470 --> 01:53:41,030
honestly here's my question are you

2555
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:44,420
are you as versatile in your business

2556
01:53:41,029 --> 01:53:47,210
model as you are in your cultivation for

2557
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:49,819
instance if you attract more people to

2558
01:53:47,210 --> 01:53:51,560
your brand by having other products out

2559
01:53:49,819 --> 01:53:53,719
there and eventually they make their way

2560
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:57,410
to your flower which is where you want

2561
01:53:53,720 --> 01:54:00,530
them to be isn't that a good thing is is

2562
01:53:57,409 --> 01:54:03,409
like is that a nod we have to make to

2563
01:54:00,529 --> 01:54:05,920
where the markets go it's amazing that's

2564
01:54:03,409 --> 01:54:10,909
exactly where I want to be if I have

2565
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:11,960
amazing fresh frozen or a sauce maker or

2566
01:54:10,909 --> 01:54:14,329
somebody that wants to do a

2567
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:16,970
collaboration with me I'm down with it

2568
01:54:14,329 --> 01:54:20,449
you know I'm open with collaborations

2569
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:23,270
because I grow a good weed I have no

2570
01:54:20,449 --> 01:54:26,029
idea how to how to make oil sauce fresh

2571
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:27,620
frozen you know I I'm old school hash

2572
01:54:26,029 --> 01:54:30,079
you know I could make hash you know I

2573
01:54:27,619 --> 01:54:34,640
don't know that so and I don't pretend

2574
01:54:30,079 --> 01:54:37,220
to yeah I'm open to any any type I

2575
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:40,700
believe it definitely helps a brand to

2576
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:47,539
have multiple products come out of what

2577
01:54:40,699 --> 01:54:51,099
you grow that good the only way that

2578
01:54:47,539 --> 01:54:54,109
you can hold the product to showcase a

2579
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:55,789
season is in a concentrate form because

2580
01:54:54,109 --> 01:54:57,199
flour breaks down just due to the fact

2581
01:54:55,789 --> 01:55:00,710
that it's got too much organic matter

2582
01:54:57,199 --> 01:55:02,989
right and so a small amount I think of

2583
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:05,239
stuff that we make should always go into

2584
01:55:02,989 --> 01:55:07,399
some form of concentrate being a

2585
01:55:05,239 --> 01:55:10,550
traditional hash but even if it's enter

2586
01:55:07,399 --> 01:55:12,259
in in a BHO extract where it was diamond

2587
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:14,810
and sauce that shit'll just sugar up

2588
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:17,449
over time but if it's held cold and you

2589
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:20,420
open a 34-year jar up it's still rates

2590
01:55:17,449 --> 01:55:22,579
and so I think that that's the only way

2591
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:24,710
that you can kind of take people back to

2592
01:55:22,579 --> 01:55:27,439
let them see what the seasons were like

2593
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:30,319
so that you get to show them this this

2594
01:55:27,439 --> 01:55:31,969
progression of time and that's what

2595
01:55:30,319 --> 01:55:33,649
that's what's cool about it by holding

2596
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:35,869
concentrate form is that you

2597
01:55:33,649 --> 01:55:38,809
you just get to kind of go back in time

2598
01:55:35,869 --> 01:55:40,849
and say man 2017 was a fucking epic year

2599
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:42,710
look at the look at the oil the herbs

2600
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:44,270
long gone but we still have some oil

2601
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:55,789
left and we'll break when I the farmers

2602
01:55:44,270 --> 01:56:02,660
are on saw in the freezer Frenchy you

2603
01:55:55,789 --> 01:56:05,269
know he was always saying you can hold

2604
01:56:02,659 --> 01:56:07,340
that for time and I think that that's

2605
01:56:05,270 --> 01:56:09,050
something that that it's important too

2606
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:11,150
because otherwise nobody gets to see

2607
01:56:09,050 --> 01:56:12,739
what the farm did in the years prior and

2608
01:56:11,149 --> 01:56:15,949
you can kind of help people understand

2609
01:56:12,739 --> 01:56:18,619
the changes in environment and in your

2610
01:56:15,949 --> 01:56:20,739
development as a cultivator by what the

2611
01:56:18,619 --> 01:56:24,019
product smokes like in that oil form

2612
01:56:20,739 --> 01:56:25,760
it's if it's it's not it doesn't have to

2613
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:27,830
be so fuckin difficult because

2614
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:30,350
ultimately we're all smokers who want to

2615
01:56:27,829 --> 01:56:31,760
share good smoke with other smokers what

2616
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:33,920
is it like we're disconnected from the

2617
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:36,280
dope game we're born in the fucking dope

2618
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:39,800
game and what you want to do is have you

2619
01:56:36,279 --> 01:56:41,149
embrace it with us what I mean now that

2620
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:42,529
we're not fucking criminals and being

2621
01:56:41,149 --> 01:56:45,500
persecuted and hung up on the fucking

2622
01:56:42,529 --> 01:56:46,939
Street it's a lot better because now for

2623
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:48,949
the first time you could really get

2624
01:56:46,939 --> 01:56:51,169
people to get caught up in let's enjoy a

2625
01:56:48,949 --> 01:56:52,849
good pot together it's not anybody

2626
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:54,649
smarter or better it's just that we're

2627
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:59,390
all fucking humans who have that

2628
01:56:54,649 --> 01:57:01,598
commonality so let's talk pricing a

2629
01:56:59,390 --> 01:57:04,760
bunch of people we're asking if you guys

2630
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:09,050
seems like prices are going back up so a

2631
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:12,289
couple questions like we talked to Chia

2632
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:13,969
Rodriguez from our kana flower or

2633
01:57:12,288 --> 01:57:16,069
Mendocino generations and she was

2634
01:57:13,969 --> 01:57:17,899
talking about how two years ago

2635
01:57:16,069 --> 01:57:19,308
everybody was calling her for trim

2636
01:57:17,899 --> 01:57:21,228
because they wanted to turn it into

2637
01:57:19,309 --> 01:57:23,929
extract and nobody really cared about

2638
01:57:21,229 --> 01:57:28,219
the flower now she gets no calls for

2639
01:57:23,929 --> 01:57:31,788
trim they're all for flower so I guess

2640
01:57:28,219 --> 01:57:34,158
let's start with like GN yeah it was so

2641
01:57:31,788 --> 01:57:37,788
you're selling bulk so obviously like to

2642
01:57:34,158 --> 01:57:40,698
tell us where prices have been going for

2643
01:57:37,788 --> 01:57:42,828
flower and trim and then Jason you do

2644
01:57:40,698 --> 01:57:45,768
have what are you doing with all the

2645
01:57:42,828 --> 01:57:47,899
extra like the trim from your farm is

2646
01:57:45,769 --> 01:57:50,479
that worth anything right now or what's

2647
01:57:47,899 --> 01:57:58,129
kind of your model for using the whole

2648
01:57:50,479 --> 01:58:00,530
animal bones and all 100% I would say

2649
01:57:58,130 --> 01:58:03,529
it's more like a year ago every phone

2650
01:58:00,529 --> 01:58:05,090
call that I got where I need 10,000

2651
01:58:03,529 --> 01:58:06,529
pounds of trend a week I need 10,000

2652
01:58:05,090 --> 01:58:09,429
pounds of trend week all day every day

2653
01:58:06,529 --> 01:58:12,050
every phone call those same people

2654
01:58:09,429 --> 01:58:13,819
including Humboldt County manufacturers

2655
01:58:12,050 --> 01:58:16,070
they were manufacturing centric and

2656
01:58:13,819 --> 01:58:17,868
distillate centric are all now pink

2657
01:58:16,069 --> 01:58:20,288
their flower distributors they don't

2658
01:58:17,868 --> 01:58:22,819
want they don't even didn't even cut the

2659
01:58:20,288 --> 01:58:27,738
manufacturers don't call me for trim

2660
01:58:22,819 --> 01:58:31,009
they call me for flower so is completely

2661
01:58:27,738 --> 01:58:33,438
swapped around in all those big farms in

2662
01:58:31,010 --> 01:58:36,439
central Cali Central Coast and a bar a

2663
01:58:33,439 --> 01:58:39,920
lot of that pots going to manufacturers

2664
01:58:36,439 --> 01:58:45,110
so that market is saturated more than

2665
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:47,599
flower it is brutal they can't sell the

2666
01:58:45,109 --> 01:58:49,578
flower they can't sell their flowers so

2667
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:53,529
fucked up they are got to send the

2668
01:58:49,578 --> 01:58:53,529
flower how to concentrate it's so booked

2669
01:58:57,488 --> 01:59:02,388
you take any shitty weed you turn in the

2670
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:04,788
oil you can put some bullshit Terps in

2671
01:59:02,389 --> 01:59:07,550
there and then some person it tastes

2672
01:59:04,788 --> 01:59:10,340
like fuckin candy and it's still dis

2673
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:12,170
shitty weed you know the big brands in

2674
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:14,150
the state that have been shopping in

2675
01:59:12,170 --> 01:59:15,288
that in those areas that we were just

2676
01:59:14,149 --> 01:59:17,569
discussing

2677
01:59:15,288 --> 01:59:19,279
are hollering out us heart and they want

2678
01:59:17,569 --> 01:59:22,308
to fill their jars with our herb and

2679
01:59:19,279 --> 01:59:27,229
they'll pay and it's transitioning as we

2680
01:59:22,309 --> 01:59:29,750
speak today in this moment prices for

2681
01:59:27,229 --> 01:59:32,089
trim or we're selling trim for averaging

2682
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:34,038
probably $100 a pound still today it

2683
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:36,170
went down and then it kind of got went

2684
01:59:34,038 --> 01:59:38,779
back up a little bit it was in the 50 60

2685
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:41,569
dollar mark about six months ago and now

2686
01:59:38,779 --> 01:59:43,279
it's back up into the 80 to 120 probably

2687
01:59:41,569 --> 01:59:44,569
averaging about a hundred for us I don't

2688
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:46,578
know what's going on off there for other

2689
01:59:44,569 --> 01:59:48,229
people that's what's that's what I just

2690
01:59:46,578 --> 01:59:50,179
see all day every day

2691
01:59:48,229 --> 01:59:51,979
we're so empowered and that to the

2692
01:59:50,179 --> 01:59:54,288
farmer right now in between a thousand

2693
01:59:51,979 --> 01:59:57,738
and fifteen this depends on what it is

2694
01:59:54,288 --> 02:00:01,819
and where it's grown and quality and who

2695
01:59:57,738 --> 02:00:04,279
was going to I see it I see it the price

2696
02:00:01,819 --> 02:00:06,618
actually continuing to go up for the

2697
02:00:04,279 --> 02:00:09,979
next 30 days I think we might see a 16

2698
02:00:06,618 --> 02:00:11,960
we might see an 18 I think come July

2699
02:00:09,979 --> 02:00:13,848
August it's gonna get back down into

2700
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:15,828
where we're at currently today and then

2701
02:00:13,849 --> 02:00:18,920
I think you know fall is gonna be what

2702
02:00:15,828 --> 02:00:20,868
it is we'll be back down into the 800 mm

2703
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:23,800
category and we're not gonna sell pot at

2704
02:00:20,868 --> 02:00:29,018
that price unless the farmer makes us

2705
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:29,019
what when was the last time you saw 1800

2706
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:45,230
you know it's probably no five years I

2707
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:47,960
can't even they can't tell you the

2708
02:00:45,229 --> 02:00:50,209
prices have been so all over the board

2709
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:52,460
and you know who would have thought it

2710
02:00:50,210 --> 02:00:54,609
and definite could all sudden make the

2711
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:56,750
places go up all the sudden we have a

2712
02:00:54,609 --> 02:01:00,259
everybody wants to chill at home and

2713
02:00:56,750 --> 02:01:06,800
smoke weed and you know I I'm doing the

2714
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:08,599
same things I I what you're asking me to

2715
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:10,538
afford to you know what the Tramp is

2716
02:01:08,599 --> 02:01:12,529
yeah we wanted to do something with

2717
02:01:10,538 --> 02:01:14,840
everything we have so yeah we want to

2718
02:01:12,529 --> 02:01:16,670
sell all of it there at the time we used

2719
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:19,130
to throw shakes head up the hill didn't

2720
02:01:16,670 --> 02:01:21,440
matter and then all of a sudden it was

2721
02:01:19,130 --> 02:01:23,630
worth of time yeah I mean like you said

2722
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:27,109
people wanted shake them nobody even

2723
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:28,819
wanted but so you know I think there's a

2724
02:01:27,109 --> 02:01:31,219
there's something for all

2725
02:01:28,819 --> 02:01:34,340
all of it definitely the littles they're

2726
02:01:31,220 --> 02:01:38,270
versatile pre-rolls you know he rolls

2727
02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:40,819
are great you know I definitely make

2728
02:01:38,270 --> 02:01:43,040
sure to sell every bit we can I mean

2729
02:01:40,819 --> 02:01:44,840
it'd be nice to make papers out of the

2730
02:01:43,039 --> 02:01:46,850
stems if I had the right people to do it

2731
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:48,440
I'd love to do that as well you know

2732
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:50,120
there's a lot of good product I mean I

2733
02:01:48,439 --> 02:01:52,669
was picking leaves the other day and I

2734
02:01:50,119 --> 02:01:55,699
mean they were so big and juicy I was I

2735
02:01:52,670 --> 02:01:57,560
wanted to juice these leaves and you

2736
02:01:55,699 --> 02:01:59,720
know I've never done that or I've never

2737
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:01,430
drink the juice from them but they look

2738
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:03,530
so great so yeah there's lots I could do

2739
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:07,630
with you do you ever make canna guards

2740
02:02:03,529 --> 02:02:11,059
no no what is that once miss smoking

2741
02:02:07,630 --> 02:02:13,640
it's their role in a it's cool looking

2742
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:16,220
but they smoke like shit man and gives

2743
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:17,900
Polly you make up yeah you make a pot

2744
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:18,740
leaf cigar but the problem is it doesn't

2745
02:02:17,899 --> 02:02:22,279
fuck it

2746
02:02:18,739 --> 02:02:25,149
tobacco's Molly no yeah you may have wet

2747
02:02:22,279 --> 02:02:27,739
then you heart it hardens up and

2748
02:02:25,149 --> 02:02:31,729
couldn't look any cooler but I've never

2749
02:02:27,739 --> 02:02:36,229
had one that I enjoyed smoked very moody

2750
02:02:31,729 --> 02:02:38,479
on traditional paper smoker I mean for

2751
02:02:36,229 --> 02:02:40,609
pricing though right now like because

2752
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:43,369
they've been swell chin down on all the

2753
02:02:40,609 --> 02:02:46,159
the hot operations street prices

2754
02:02:43,369 --> 02:02:48,829
exploded and so I mean I think run to

2755
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:50,269
moving it like 32 from end or just you

2756
02:02:48,829 --> 02:02:52,579
know a month or two ago I have someone

2757
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:54,680
tell me 38 five down in the city right

2758
02:02:52,579 --> 02:02:55,550
now so I can heard those numbers and

2759
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:58,039
fucking years

2760
02:02:55,550 --> 02:02:59,659
yeah so what I know is that you're

2761
02:02:58,039 --> 02:03:01,970
you're gonna see some changes in price

2762
02:02:59,659 --> 02:03:03,739
and what fucks us in California is that

2763
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:05,630
there's not enough storefronts and too

2764
02:03:03,739 --> 02:03:07,489
much large production so as an

2765
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:09,710
overproduction situation it doesn't

2766
02:03:07,489 --> 02:03:12,590
reflect the reality of cannabis because

2767
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:15,020
we only have you know 1,500 stores so

2768
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:17,119
when you open this shit back up and now

2769
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:19,040
you have stores to move herb into the

2770
02:03:17,119 --> 02:03:20,689
pricing will I think rise up again but

2771
02:03:19,039 --> 02:03:24,619
like Chris just laid out he's seeing the

2772
02:03:20,689 --> 02:03:30,319
cycle right now there's some there's

2773
02:03:24,619 --> 02:03:32,420
huge build outs so when all these giant

2774
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:34,609
build outs happen well that's definitely

2775
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:38,199
gonna make the market you know kind of a

2776
02:03:34,609 --> 02:03:41,239
little bit but that's why Appalachians

2777
02:03:38,199 --> 02:03:42,229
humble our brands that's why we have to

2778
02:03:41,239 --> 02:03:45,679
stay who we are

2779
02:03:42,229 --> 02:03:47,238
because I mean those those big those big

2780
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:48,440
build outs are still they're gonna grow

2781
02:03:47,238 --> 02:03:50,839
well they're gonna grow they're gonna

2782
02:03:48,439 --> 02:03:53,349
grow killer Coors Light weed you know

2783
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:53,350
yeah

2784
02:03:53,750 --> 02:04:00,710
be great for that but we you know if we

2785
02:03:58,460 --> 02:04:02,930
keep educating the consumers and they

2786
02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:05,779
know what we're growing you know and

2787
02:04:02,930 --> 02:04:07,550
they know that we are they sell they buy

2788
02:04:05,779 --> 02:04:09,738
my weed it's gonna be great it's gonna

2789
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:11,779
be you know it's grown organically well

2790
02:04:09,738 --> 02:04:14,589
not only that the money I get you know I

2791
02:04:11,779 --> 02:04:16,819
coach baseball I'm part of lots of

2792
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:20,510
things in southern Hummel well this

2793
02:04:16,819 --> 02:04:22,699
money helped my community go not only

2794
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:24,350
what they're smoking it's where that

2795
02:04:22,699 --> 02:04:25,880
money's going and you know what that

2796
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:28,130
money is helping out it's helping out

2797
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:30,079

2798
02:04:28,130 --> 02:04:33,440
basketball gym so you see our farm names

2799
02:04:30,079 --> 02:04:35,600
on the gyms you know so it's it's a it's

2800
02:04:33,439 --> 02:04:38,689
a lot more it's a big it's a big thing

2801
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:40,640
and that's what I feel this whole legal

2802
02:04:38,689 --> 02:04:42,500
market not only are my kids safe from

2803
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:45,140
having the house raided like that so

2804
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:47,720

02:04:50,210 --> 02:04:55,369

everywhere I could I'm always me and my

2809

family have always been great you know

2810
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:01,880
supporters of the community but now we

2811
02:04:59,689 --> 02:05:04,009
could actually have our brands out there

2812
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:06,770
and it really makes our children proud

2813
02:05:04,010 --> 02:05:08,900

2815
02:05:08,899 --> 02:05:13,129
and that's really it I'm doing this for

2816
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:15,110
the community I want southern humble to

2817
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:17,210
thrive oh with emerald trouble and we're

2818
02:05:15,109 --> 02:05:21,319

02:05:17,210 --> 02:05:23,239
you know we we we use Humboldt County

2820
02:05:21,319 --> 02:05:25,099
this is our heritage this is what we've

2821
02:05:23,238 --> 02:05:27,769

2822
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:30,410
our family our parents our grandparents

2823
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:32,000

amazing speaker but why I'm doing this

2829
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:51,649
is so the consumers can learn who we are

2830
02:05:49,430 --> 02:05:53,989
when that we are real people

2831
02:05:51,649 --> 02:05:54,979
and we're not just about money or about

2832

so Kevin you you planted this year right

2842
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:29,099
yeah yeah and I realized here too i I

2843
02:06:26,579 --> 02:06:32,399
was gonna skip the season because the

2844
02:06:29,099 --> 02:06:34,260
the the lysis shit was such a freak show

2845
02:06:32,399 --> 02:06:36,598
and all of a sudden I pulled the annual

2846
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:38,639
and a company hit me up and said hey

2847
02:06:36,599 --> 02:06:42,210
would you be willing to run a run for us

2848
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:46,199
so this year though I already have my my

2849
02:06:42,210 --> 02:06:49,408
annual renewed and so I'm my farms fully

2850
02:06:46,198 --> 02:06:53,069
ready all the soils detailed props have

2851
02:06:49,408 --> 02:06:54,868
been put in and I'm just waiting to go

2852
02:06:53,069 --> 02:06:56,399
in the ground when this last of this

2853
02:06:54,868 --> 02:06:58,079
little weather bumps and then I'm gonna

2854
02:06:56,399 --> 02:07:00,539
run like I said I just run a full term

2855
02:06:58,079 --> 02:07:02,039
and for me that's that's just really

2856
02:07:00,539 --> 02:07:04,649
because that's where I wanted to be as

2857
02:07:02,039 --> 02:07:06,810
an older guy I wanted to go back to what

2858
02:07:04,649 --> 02:07:08,279
herb was to me when I was young so I've

2859
02:07:06,810 --> 02:07:11,099
been through the whole fucking game

2860
02:07:08,279 --> 02:07:14,219
for as a grower I wanted to do an

2861
02:07:11,099 --> 02:07:18,510
intense season and then have the rest of

2862
02:07:14,219 --> 02:07:22,739
the year not that I'm excited it's gonna

2863
02:07:18,510 --> 02:07:25,469
be great yeah and and awning for your

2864
02:07:22,738 --> 02:07:28,769

2865
02:07:25,469 --> 02:07:31,139
just sell it bulker what's that well

2866
02:07:28,770 --> 02:07:33,989
I'll do a two things actually I'll Co

2867
02:07:31,139 --> 02:07:37,020
brand with the company so the company

2868
02:07:33,988 --> 02:07:38,819
will have me on their label for their

2869
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:41,639
product because I'm growing the product

2870
02:07:38,819 --> 02:07:43,979
from them and then I wanted to also grow

2871
02:07:41,639 --> 02:07:46,199
something that wasn't in their catalogue

2872
02:07:43,979 --> 02:07:47,669
for myself because you mean you're

2873
02:07:46,198 --> 02:07:49,979
growing their genetics

2874
02:07:47,670 --> 02:07:51,840
yeah grown their genetics and then I'll

2875
02:07:49,979 --> 02:07:53,488
produce it they'll produce their product

2876
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:56,010
for them and then I'll get recognition

2877
02:07:53,488 --> 02:07:58,408
on the jar which are you allowing a

2878
02:07:56,010 --> 02:07:58,980
savior that is yeah yes it's for the

2879
02:07:58,408 --> 02:08:01,618
cookies

2880
02:07:58,979 --> 02:08:04,589
okay so I'll also I'll do work for the

2881
02:08:01,618 --> 02:08:06,359
cookies and it's a good contract and

2882
02:08:04,590 --> 02:08:08,900
what it does it allows me to be able to

2883
02:08:06,359 --> 02:08:13,259
have surety on the business

2884
02:08:08,899 --> 02:08:15,119
it I need the stability to cover the

2885
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:17,280
actual business and then what I'll do is

2886
02:08:15,119 --> 02:08:19,649
I'll take about 20 thousand square foot

2887
02:08:17,279 --> 02:08:22,469
awful 4,000 square foot off and I'll do

2888
02:08:19,649 --> 02:08:24,269
that myself and I have something that I

2889
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:26,820
really wanted to run that just as an

2890
02:08:24,270 --> 02:08:29,400
outlier freak and I just said you know

2891
02:08:26,819 --> 02:08:31,739
this has to be produced just because I

2892
02:08:29,399 --> 02:08:33,509
got a seat in the market and then once I

2893
02:08:31,739 --> 02:08:35,760
produce it I'll figure out how to move

2894
02:08:33,510 --> 02:08:37,170
it into the world from there but I just

2895
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:40,289
know that I need to grow it on the hill

2896
02:08:37,170 --> 02:08:42,300
because the quality of flowers per line

2897
02:08:40,289 --> 02:08:45,359
and it's got numbers that are ridiculous

2898
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:47,310
I under your own brand name yeah I'll do

2899
02:08:45,359 --> 02:08:48,719
it out of my own brand name so what's

2900
02:08:47,310 --> 02:08:51,990
the brand name you know what's the brand

2901
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:55,320
my brand sport right out okay surprise

2902
02:08:51,989 --> 02:08:59,460
is your store still open it's open right

2903
02:08:55,319 --> 02:09:02,489
yeah I think we just officially opened

2904
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:03,960
up the coffee shop the tourist area that

2905
02:09:02,489 --> 02:09:06,869
we opened up the whole thing we got a

2906
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:08,789
smoke alarms going in this summer so we

2907
02:09:06,869 --> 02:09:10,890
have a full outdoor lounge going in

2908
02:09:08,789 --> 02:09:13,789
legal slope lounge and the circle where

2909
02:09:10,890 --> 02:09:17,520
we turn our store in to a drive-in keine

2910
02:09:13,789 --> 02:09:22,680
so you are no built-in retail outlet for

2911
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:37,290
your own brand I do I do but which is

2912
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:39,500
cool are you gonna carry a Ridgeline but

2913
02:09:37,289 --> 02:09:41,729
I don't handle any of the inner

2914
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:44,819
transactions I can preferred you to the

2915
02:09:41,729 --> 02:09:50,789
buyer team yeah I can't always many

2916
02:09:44,819 --> 02:09:52,649
people he's the Fuhrer you man I try it

2917
02:09:50,789 --> 02:09:54,720
makes it it used to be a lot different

2918
02:09:52,649 --> 02:09:56,429
because at one time we ran everything

2919
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:59,010
ourselves because that's how the

2920
02:09:56,430 --> 02:10:01,980
operations work but as you go forward

2921
02:09:59,010 --> 02:10:03,810
with all this new shit it's just not

2922
02:10:01,979 --> 02:10:06,059
that way anymore and so the only thing I

2923
02:10:03,810 --> 02:10:08,310
have full control over what I do is the

2924
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:09,840
farm and so this is it'll be nice

2925
02:10:08,310 --> 02:10:11,340
because I can do business that's

2926
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:15,510
business and then I can be something

2927
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:19,020
that I want to produce myself I love the

2928
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:20,480
flower yeah the flower yeah it's great

2929
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:21,770
having them out of school and

2930
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:23,269
coronavirus me

2931
02:10:21,770 --> 02:10:24,790
been a nightmare for them in a lot of

2932
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:26,960
ways but the happy kids in the house

2933
02:10:24,789 --> 02:10:29,090
it's just been great we're at the river

2934
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:30,770
yesterday and we're gonna probably go

2935
02:10:29,090 --> 02:10:33,170
take off and hit the record amaro I got

2936
02:10:30,770 --> 02:10:36,020
some cool blog shit we got on the rapids

2937
02:10:33,170 --> 02:10:38,600
with but a lot of it is just as a

2938
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:40,490
producer you have to do things that that

2939
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:43,460
you know will make money because you

2940
02:10:40,489 --> 02:10:45,619
have bills to pay the County charges be

2941
02:10:43,460 --> 02:10:47,989
twenty thousand whether I harvest the

2942
02:10:45,619 --> 02:10:49,880
buck or not the state charges me

2943
02:10:47,989 --> 02:10:50,539
fourteen thousand whether it harvest the

2944
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:53,600
buck or not

2945
02:10:50,539 --> 02:10:55,100
so that's fourteen that's uh what's that

2946
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:57,320
thirty four thousand right there right

2947
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:58,910
then I got another 5k going out to let

2948
02:10:57,319 --> 02:11:01,340
water board most of the shit so you're

2949
02:10:58,909 --> 02:11:03,170
looking at like almost 40 grand coming

2950
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:07,520
out of your pocket whether you make a

2951
02:11:03,170 --> 02:11:10,130
dollar and so 40 grand is almost taken

2952
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:12,910
home like 17 so if you make 70 K you'll

2953
02:11:10,130 --> 02:11:15,590
take home around make 40 mm so that's a

2954
02:11:12,909 --> 02:11:23,689
$70,000 year job and Emmanuel in the

2955
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:26,510
time so a small portion of the cannabis

2956
02:11:23,689 --> 02:11:29,359
on the canopy can be me so that I can

2957
02:11:26,510 --> 02:11:31,670
kind of enjoy being my stout and then

2958
02:11:29,359 --> 02:11:33,319
the other part is good business and I

2959
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:35,119
don't mind growing their varieties

2960
02:11:33,319 --> 02:11:37,759
because the stuff that putting out is

2961
02:11:35,119 --> 02:11:39,050
highly marketable and my business

2962
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:41,329
dealings with the company had been

2963
02:11:39,050 --> 02:11:43,460
nothing but good you know I have no

2964
02:11:41,329 --> 02:11:46,579
complaints it's been straight normal

2965
02:11:43,460 --> 02:11:49,250
solid business and that's what I would I

2966
02:11:46,579 --> 02:11:54,199
needed when I you know got involved in

2967
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:56,750
this stuff so we just had a Los Angeles

2968
02:11:54,199 --> 02:11:59,630
retailer on whose vertical and also

2969
02:11:56,750 --> 02:12:02,539
grows and has his own branded product on

2970
02:11:59,630 --> 02:12:05,690
the shelves including his own and I hate

2971
02:12:02,539 --> 02:12:07,819
to bring up the dreaded T word taxes but

2972
02:12:05,689 --> 02:12:10,009
he said the taxes in California are so

2973
02:12:07,819 --> 02:12:13,969
fucked up that it makes more economic

2974
02:12:10,010 --> 02:12:16,909
sense now for him to bulk his own flower

2975
02:12:13,970 --> 02:12:18,380
rather than put it on his own shelf and

2976
02:12:16,909 --> 02:12:21,470
it sounds like he's you're in the same

2977
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:23,840
oh yeah the retail the thing with the

2978
02:12:21,470 --> 02:12:26,240
store is that stores give you access to

2979
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:28,699
people if you if you're if you do a

2980
02:12:26,239 --> 02:12:31,429
store if it's not in a geographical area

2981
02:12:28,699 --> 02:12:33,409
where you get phenomenal traffic you

2982
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:35,250
have to make it very streamline so when

2983
02:12:33,409 --> 02:12:38,039
I laid out my storefront it was the

2984
02:12:35,250 --> 02:12:40,949
designed to handle quick traffic through

2985
02:12:38,039 --> 02:12:42,750
the facility and have minimal staffing

2986
02:12:40,949 --> 02:12:46,979
but intelligent people behind the

2987
02:12:42,750 --> 02:12:48,659
counter and you know I mean like I think

2988
02:12:46,979 --> 02:12:50,879
some of my favorite stars I've have been

2989
02:12:48,659 --> 02:12:53,430
to is like dockside up in Washington

2990
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:55,230
so dockside in Washington is really well

2991
02:12:53,430 --> 02:12:58,070
done stores where they got a customer

2992
02:12:55,229 --> 02:13:00,569
service level it's phenomenal and the

2993
02:12:58,069 --> 02:13:03,569
layouts are incredible and the fucking

2994
02:13:00,569 --> 02:13:05,159
experience is phenomenal and so I I got

2995
02:13:03,569 --> 02:13:07,109
a chance to check out the dockside

2996
02:13:05,159 --> 02:13:08,970
operations and I was so impressed but I

2997
02:13:07,109 --> 02:13:11,309
realized that they would not work for me

2998
02:13:08,970 --> 02:13:13,500
at all here because of what where we're

2999
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:15,539
at and what we're going through and so

3000
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:17,399
the store is something that gives you

3001
02:13:15,539 --> 02:13:19,409
access to the public it helps you

3002
02:13:17,399 --> 02:13:23,339
understand what's moving through distro

3003
02:13:19,409 --> 02:13:26,340
it's like a window and but it's not

3004
02:13:23,340 --> 02:13:28,199
whether the profit is it pays for itself

3005
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:30,300
pays for the investment costs to build

3006
02:13:28,199 --> 02:13:32,130
and it pays to the employees it creates

3007
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:35,070
an ability to have a license that's in

3008
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:36,779
continuing but you know for me being a

3009
02:13:35,069 --> 02:13:39,509
farmer especially because I actually run

3010
02:13:36,779 --> 02:13:42,329
my own farm so I can send myself the

3011
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:45,329
laborer so I get I get to pay myself

3012
02:13:42,329 --> 02:13:48,119
labor and then I get to make profit for

3013
02:13:45,329 --> 02:13:50,760
my company and because I was always a

3014
02:13:48,119 --> 02:13:53,760
person who loved to grow pot being

3015
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:56,760
outside for long hours in the Sun I

3016
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:58,890
don't see it as a punishment so like you

3017
02:13:56,760 --> 02:14:00,690
know for me I mean I'm a blue-collar in

3018
02:13:58,890 --> 02:14:02,820
New England and so like the work thing

3019
02:14:00,689 --> 02:14:04,589
isn't a problem I actually like what I

3020
02:14:02,819 --> 02:14:07,469
do a lot I like it so much I've done it

3021
02:14:04,590 --> 02:14:09,989
my own fucking life so it's there's like

3022
02:14:07,470 --> 02:14:12,990
a dual benefit where like I get a good

3023
02:14:09,989 --> 02:14:15,929
paycheck as a worker and I get to do

3024
02:14:12,989 --> 02:14:18,889
what I love but the store is more of a

3025
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:21,539
matter of building supply chain

3026
02:14:18,890 --> 02:14:23,400
components and it gives you a really

3027
02:14:21,539 --> 02:14:26,039
good window but man for people that have

3028
02:14:23,399 --> 02:14:27,960
stores and areas that you know are going

3029
02:14:26,039 --> 02:14:31,229
to be impacted by cold but heavily in

3030
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:35,189
terms of financial situations look pity

3031
02:14:31,229 --> 02:14:36,779
these poor people because you don't you

3032
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:38,669
don't want to see anybody fail I don't

3033
02:14:36,779 --> 02:14:41,099
take Glee and seen anyone get the shit

3034
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:42,930
kicked out of them really like I know

3035
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:44,640
you know sometimes you might deserve it

3036
02:14:42,930 --> 02:14:47,579
but if I celebrate it too much it means

3037
02:14:44,640 --> 02:14:48,579
I'm fucked up and so I try not to get

3038
02:14:47,579 --> 02:14:50,319
caught up in that

3039
02:14:48,579 --> 02:14:54,399
and so what I know is that with us as

3040
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:58,630
operators each license has its own

3041
02:14:54,399 --> 02:15:00,399
pitfalls and they they all have a plus

3042
02:14:58,630 --> 02:15:02,619
and a minus and you have to clearly

3043
02:15:00,399 --> 02:15:04,599
identify what that is before you get

3044
02:15:02,619 --> 02:15:06,069
involved in it so you can understand

3045
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:09,820
that if you're gonna put that into your

3046
02:15:06,069 --> 02:15:11,739
portfolio it has to cover itself and it

3047
02:15:09,819 --> 02:15:14,139
might not make money but it's a supply

3048
02:15:11,739 --> 02:15:16,090
chain component that lets you have a

3049
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:18,640
different type of strength in your

3050
02:15:16,090 --> 02:15:20,860
business and I mean who ever would have

3051
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:22,480
thought we had to do all this shit like

3052
02:15:20,859 --> 02:15:24,609
really like the complexity that we're

3053
02:15:22,479 --> 02:15:27,819
going through to survive is mind-bending

3054
02:15:24,609 --> 02:15:29,079
and it's people say well that's business

3055
02:15:27,819 --> 02:15:30,489
but I'm like I've been in business for a

3056
02:15:29,079 --> 02:15:37,059
long time no other business you have to

3057
02:15:30,489 --> 02:15:40,119
do this much weird shit it's crazy so so

3058
02:15:37,060 --> 02:15:46,420
wait with use you said it was twenty

3059
02:15:40,119 --> 02:15:49,359
thousand square feet and 16 is going to

3060
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:51,190
the cookies collaboration yeah roughly

3061
02:15:49,359 --> 02:15:53,079
probably like 15 because I'm not really

3062
02:15:51,189 --> 02:15:55,989
gonna pull one of the benches out

3063
02:15:53,079 --> 02:15:58,029
because I didn't get a chance to do the

3064
02:15:55,989 --> 02:15:59,739
work on that lower bench to prep it like

3065
02:15:58,029 --> 02:16:04,239
I was doing the others and I just said

3066
02:15:59,739 --> 02:16:05,619
it out sometimes you have to make sure

3067
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:09,010
when you're doing the labor that it's

3068
02:16:05,619 --> 02:16:11,590
workable and it's not important to fill

3069
02:16:09,010 --> 02:16:14,110
the whole canopy always at the same time

3070
02:16:11,590 --> 02:16:15,489
and that's where like the Canadians the

3071
02:16:14,109 --> 02:16:16,869
best examples of Canadians I got a

3072
02:16:15,489 --> 02:16:18,279
million square for the greenhouse they

3073
02:16:16,869 --> 02:16:19,930
should have ran like a hundred thousand

3074
02:16:18,279 --> 02:16:21,880
square foot and instead they ran a

3075
02:16:19,930 --> 02:16:25,570
million square foot and they only could

3076
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:27,520
move 50,000 square feet so it's the same

3077
02:16:25,569 --> 02:16:29,649
with what we're doing is I'm filling up

3078
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:34,479
the quantity that I can control myself

3079
02:16:29,649 --> 02:16:36,849
with a single worker and so out the 24

3080
02:16:34,479 --> 02:16:38,468
is going that way 16 could potentially

3081
02:16:36,849 --> 02:16:41,349
go to the cookie but probably more like

3082
02:16:38,468 --> 02:16:43,750
14 so I'll pull 2,000 right out of the

3083
02:16:41,349 --> 02:16:45,489
canopy this year and not run it because

3084
02:16:43,750 --> 02:16:48,459
it when I started laying out my time

3085
02:16:45,489 --> 02:16:50,888
schedule on the work I realized that I'm

3086
02:16:48,459 --> 02:16:54,459
not dialed in enough to cover another

3087
02:16:50,888 --> 02:16:57,609
2,000 square for the labor but but so

3088
02:16:54,459 --> 02:17:01,119
women cookies are you running their

3089
02:16:57,610 --> 02:17:02,079
genetics or your genetics no their

3090
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:04,870
genetics remember I

3091
02:17:02,079 --> 02:17:07,388
I have the nursery that supplies them so

3092
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:09,400
all of their all their breeders feed the

3093
02:17:07,388 --> 02:17:11,259
nursery um I'm involved with my old

3094
02:17:09,399 --> 02:17:15,459
nursery is a new nursery but now it's a

3095
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:17,860
single client nursery and it it puts the

3096
02:17:15,459 --> 02:17:19,598
genetics that the proprietary farms the

3097
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:21,730
farms that catch the first release of

3098
02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:23,979
the lines so there's the humble

3099
02:17:21,729 --> 02:17:25,388
population group which is forearms and

3100
02:17:23,979 --> 02:17:27,039
Humboldt County that are going to work

3101
02:17:25,388 --> 02:17:29,049
producing product for cookies and then

3102
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:31,030
other farms within California that

3103
02:17:29,049 --> 02:17:34,539
produce they all come get the genetics

3104
02:17:31,030 --> 02:17:38,290
from us at the shop and so what what we

3105
02:17:34,540 --> 02:17:40,330
do is we just produce what's needed that

3106
02:17:38,290 --> 02:17:42,280
would work well in our environments so

3107
02:17:40,329 --> 02:17:46,629
that it reflects well on the on the

3108
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:48,310
brand itself so it's not a bad deal as a

3109
02:17:46,629 --> 02:17:50,769
cultivator because they don't want to

3110
02:17:48,309 --> 02:17:52,479
feed you shit that won't work they want

3111
02:17:50,770 --> 02:17:54,399
to feed you stuff that works so that you

3112
02:17:52,479 --> 02:17:55,779
have an ability to put their product out

3113
02:17:54,399 --> 02:17:58,090
and stuff that they're doing on the end

3114
02:17:55,780 --> 02:18:00,190
or render stunning it's just that when

3115
02:17:58,090 --> 02:18:02,739
you put it on the outside you know you

3116
02:18:00,190 --> 02:18:05,319
get a fuller richer expression and the

3117
02:18:02,739 --> 02:18:06,760
steering of the choices are based off of

3118
02:18:05,319 --> 02:18:08,860
because remember we have a test facility

3119
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:11,020
for that stock too so the cookies test

3120
02:18:08,860 --> 02:18:13,000
facility for outdoors behind the one log

3121
02:18:11,020 --> 02:18:15,579
so we have a full light that greenhouse

3122
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:18,429
at an outdoor next to the nursery that

3123
02:18:15,579 --> 02:18:21,309
does the R&amp;D for a lot of these projects

3124
02:18:18,429 --> 02:18:22,870
so I'm not involved in that into the

3125
02:18:21,309 --> 02:18:24,250
sense of the iron D component oh then

3126
02:18:22,870 --> 02:18:27,639
come by and smoke with some of the wheat

3127
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:29,709
the one log team is which isn't bad

3128
02:18:27,638 --> 02:18:32,348
you get court bit too much shit you

3129
02:18:29,709 --> 02:18:34,239
drown timewise but the point is that

3130
02:18:32,349 --> 02:18:36,219
it's a thought-out process because what

3131
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:39,190
they want to be able to do is create the

3132
02:18:36,218 --> 02:18:41,979
sun-grown lines around the state to

3133
02:18:39,190 --> 02:18:43,840
highlight sun-grown production and then

3134
02:18:41,979 --> 02:18:46,929
to find the varieties that shine in

3135
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:49,179
sun-grown best and then let the things

3136
02:18:46,929 --> 02:18:50,888
that shine and endure be best because to

3137
02:18:49,179 --> 02:18:55,000
say that people don't like indoors to

3138
02:18:50,888 --> 02:18:57,489
say that you'd be wrong it its desired

3139
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:59,500
by two different people and they're the

3140
02:18:57,489 --> 02:19:02,199
education isn't to get people to leave

3141
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:04,239
indoor and go to outdoor it's to let

3142
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:06,520
people know there's various grades of

3143
02:19:04,239 --> 02:19:08,440
cannabis and that all the time when you

3144
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:10,840
experience enough of it you'll be able

3145
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:13,630
to find your own balance of what you

3146
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:15,739
desire and where it's grown or how it's

3147
02:19:13,629 --> 02:19:17,299
grown but the point is to curry

3148
02:19:15,739 --> 02:19:19,909
the best product and all the

3149
02:19:17,299 --> 02:19:22,459
environments so that indoors well done

3150
02:19:19,909 --> 02:19:23,950
mixed lights well done outdoors well

3151
02:19:22,459 --> 02:19:29,529
done

3152
02:19:23,950 --> 02:19:34,630
the grass is good grass right so with

3153
02:19:29,530 --> 02:19:38,510
have they guaranteed like will buy X

3154
02:19:34,629 --> 02:19:42,978
volume from you or is it kind of a more

3155
02:19:38,510 --> 02:19:44,809
fluid relationship no it's it's what

3156
02:19:42,978 --> 02:19:46,218
what the way you work it out with this

3157
02:19:44,808 --> 02:19:48,049
will be the way you work it out with any

3158
02:19:46,218 --> 02:19:51,228
of these operations that provide you

3159
02:19:48,049 --> 02:19:52,699
material is that y'all you'll produce

3160
02:19:51,228 --> 02:19:54,590
the material you'll give them an

3161
02:19:52,700 --> 02:19:56,600
estimation of how much you believe is

3162
02:19:54,590 --> 02:19:58,159
gonna come off your farm based off your

3163
02:19:56,600 --> 02:20:00,559
your square footage and your production

3164
02:19:58,159 --> 02:20:04,340
methods and at the end of the season you

3165
02:20:00,559 --> 02:20:06,889
do a quantification testing to find out

3166
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:08,630
are you clean because before they take

3167
02:20:06,889 --> 02:20:11,719
the product into the system so you do a

3168
02:20:08,629 --> 02:20:13,339
pretest pretest comes up it gives them

3169
02:20:11,719 --> 02:20:15,709
an idea that you have no heavy metal

3170
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:18,500
issues you have no microbial issues and

3171
02:20:15,709 --> 02:20:22,879
no no other banned substances in the

3172
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:24,889
product and then it also gives them an

3173
02:20:22,879 --> 02:20:27,189
AB annoyed level so they can get an idea

3174
02:20:24,889 --> 02:20:30,079
you do an estimation of your yield and

3175
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:31,970
you can give it to them on since I don't

3176
02:20:30,079 --> 02:20:34,370
have my own processing facility what I

3177
02:20:31,969 --> 02:20:36,920
do is I pass it on to a processor but I

3178
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:39,680
can tell them I have X amount of bucks

3179
02:20:36,920 --> 02:20:41,899
flour and they can do the calculations

3180
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:45,290
on what they normally average on from

3181
02:20:41,899 --> 02:20:46,879
box to finish so say I have 400 pounds

3182
02:20:45,290 --> 02:20:49,760
bucked we might say that comes out to

3183
02:20:46,879 --> 02:20:52,369
260 pounds finished that'll give them an

3184
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:54,350
idea broken up offer your metric

3185
02:20:52,370 --> 02:20:57,590
configuration tags because remember this

3186
02:20:54,350 --> 02:20:59,479
is all track and trace and then that

3187
02:20:57,590 --> 02:21:01,399
product moves into the chain so as long

3188
02:20:59,478 --> 02:21:05,179
as the products at the quality that they

3189
02:21:01,399 --> 02:21:07,670
want it moves and that's how it should

3190
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:10,159
be with cannabis like any AG product

3191
02:21:07,670 --> 02:21:11,870
where there's no such thing as you grow

3192
02:21:10,159 --> 02:21:14,450
it for us we take it off your hands even

3193
02:21:11,870 --> 02:21:16,400
if it's shit so like that doesn't work

3194
02:21:14,450 --> 02:21:18,320
like that because who would who would do

3195
02:21:16,399 --> 02:21:20,299
that in business right so there's always

3196
02:21:18,319 --> 02:21:21,799
an incentive for the farmer to make sure

3197
02:21:20,299 --> 02:21:24,709
they do a good job because this way the

3198
02:21:21,799 --> 02:21:26,359
product moves and if a brand is willing

3199
02:21:24,709 --> 02:21:28,309
to work with you as a farmer is your

3200
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:29,090
responsibility as a farmer to make that

3201
02:21:28,309 --> 02:21:30,500
brand look good

3202
02:21:29,090 --> 02:21:33,079
regardless who it is I don't give a shit

3203
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:35,450
if it's the littlest distributor to the

3204
02:21:33,079 --> 02:21:37,789
to the biggest company as the farmer

3205
02:21:35,450 --> 02:21:41,630
your obligation is to farm the damn weed

3206
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:44,540
and do your best job and when we do that

3207
02:21:41,629 --> 02:21:46,759
we do a good job and so I don't mind

3208
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:48,649
growing other people's products and I

3209
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:51,050
know in the future as the Appalachians

3210
02:21:48,648 --> 02:21:55,728
come in we'll start to stabilize what we

3211
02:21:51,049 --> 02:21:57,379
actually produce and run in these areas

3212
02:21:55,728 --> 02:21:59,629
so that customers can get the same

3213
02:21:57,379 --> 02:22:01,129
product a couple years in a row my only

3214
02:21:59,629 --> 02:22:02,569
problem with flippin varieties

3215
02:22:01,129 --> 02:22:05,209
frequently is that you don't get the

3216
02:22:02,569 --> 02:22:07,549
repeat by next year on the same product

3217
02:22:05,209 --> 02:22:10,250
unless where's it coming from it's not

3218
02:22:07,549 --> 02:22:11,750
coming from you and so I think that as

3219
02:22:10,250 --> 02:22:13,969
we go forward and you have enough

3220
02:22:11,750 --> 02:22:16,250
producers producing enough cannabis on

3221
02:22:13,969 --> 02:22:18,319
the bulk level we'll be able to go back

3222
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:21,079
to not happen to chase the strain to

3223
02:22:18,319 --> 02:22:22,010
shore and work with things that shine on

3224
02:22:21,079 --> 02:22:23,959
our property

3225
02:22:22,010 --> 02:22:25,728
I only produce a thousand pounds a

3226
02:22:23,959 --> 02:22:28,159
thousand pounds moves into the system

3227
02:22:25,728 --> 02:22:29,510
and that's what I produce every year so

3228
02:22:28,159 --> 02:22:31,520
it's like saying I'm going to produce a

3229
02:22:29,510 --> 02:22:34,850
thousand cases of wine that's what I

3230
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:36,829
produce that's just how it is and we can

3231
02:22:34,850 --> 02:22:39,229
use all their agricultural models to

3232
02:22:36,829 --> 02:22:42,289
understand how that works and it doesn't

3233
02:22:39,228 --> 02:22:44,869
help us in a congested California market

3234
02:22:42,290 --> 02:22:46,609
but if I'm looking down the road it most

3235
02:22:44,870 --> 02:22:48,530
fucking surely does because what I'm

3236
02:22:46,609 --> 02:22:50,000
building is a quality market because

3237
02:22:48,530 --> 02:22:51,590
don't tell me people don't like no shit

3238
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,569
I mean people can drink all the fucking

3239
02:22:51,590 --> 02:22:55,969
blood wise in a run but I haven't had a

3240
02:22:53,569 --> 02:22:57,590
canned and that shit in a long time and

3241
02:22:55,969 --> 02:22:59,569
I don't drink a lot of beer so but if I

3242
02:22:57,590 --> 02:23:01,100
want a beer I go get what I like and if

3243
02:22:59,569 --> 02:23:02,930
I met someone's house they offered me a

3244
02:23:01,100 --> 02:23:05,059
Budweiser and chill now drinking juice

3245
02:23:02,930 --> 02:23:06,590
I'm not going to turn it down but the

3246
02:23:05,059 --> 02:23:09,379
point is you don't ever see me go to the

3247
02:23:06,590 --> 02:23:11,478
store and buy a 12-pack of this shit so

3248
02:23:09,379 --> 02:23:13,759
I know that if I'm not saying on every

3249
02:23:11,478 --> 02:23:16,569
consumer but people kind of operate

3250
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:20,809
pretty similarly we just have to create

3251
02:23:16,569 --> 02:23:24,739
a level of production quality that is

3252
02:23:20,809 --> 02:23:26,359
seen by all our craft regions so that

3253
02:23:24,739 --> 02:23:28,219
people start to understand the craft

3254
02:23:26,359 --> 02:23:30,350
herb is good and then they can start to

3255
02:23:28,219 --> 02:23:32,449
find regions of products that they like

3256
02:23:30,350 --> 02:23:35,720
and things that shine in certain areas

3257
02:23:32,450 --> 02:23:38,210
and the main point for all of us in

3258
02:23:35,719 --> 02:23:41,090
production sales manufacturing

3259
02:23:38,209 --> 02:23:42,319
processing is to is to try to build a

3260
02:23:41,090 --> 02:23:44,239
steady rely

3261
02:23:42,319 --> 02:23:46,010
business model it's based off of paying

3262
02:23:44,239 --> 02:23:48,350
the fucking people back that the product

3263
02:23:46,010 --> 02:23:50,360
firm just do the goddamn business and

3264
02:23:48,350 --> 02:23:51,680
that way what it does is everybody

3265
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:53,510
trusts each other because you've got

3266
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:54,620
fifty five fuckin contracts but if I

3267
02:23:53,510 --> 02:23:56,239
don't trust you I don't give a shit

3268
02:23:54,620 --> 02:23:59,180
anymore I don't want to deal with you

3269
02:23:56,239 --> 02:24:00,799
and we really went back to what we used

3270
02:23:59,180 --> 02:24:02,271
to do way back in the day where we kind

3271
02:24:00,799 --> 02:24:03,859
of looked at each other said we're both

3272
02:24:02,271 --> 02:24:05,810
here for the long term yeah we both

3273
02:24:03,860 --> 02:24:08,680
fucked up we lose money yeah now we can

3274
02:24:05,809 --> 02:24:11,029
do business and that's something that

3275
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:13,040
resonates to the customer because what

3276
02:24:11,030 --> 02:24:15,620
it says is we're here for the fucking

3277
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:18,350
long term and we're willing to fight for

3278
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:20,690
that and that means we care it's not

3279
02:24:18,350 --> 02:24:22,729
it's not on a portfolio sheet of I have

3280
02:24:20,690 --> 02:24:24,771
a weed farm I'm in we business that's

3281
02:24:22,729 --> 02:24:27,109
great are you are you a dedicated

3282
02:24:24,771 --> 02:24:29,870
producer you'd like Chris is a dedicated

3283
02:24:27,110 --> 02:24:31,790
purveyor so he was a producer but now

3284
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:33,800
he's a purveyor he looks to find the

3285
02:24:31,790 --> 02:24:34,430
things that are quality to put into the

3286
02:24:33,799 --> 02:24:37,000
market

3287
02:24:34,430 --> 02:24:39,559
jason is the creator of these things

3288
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:43,040
like the it's a chain without each

3289
02:24:39,559 --> 02:24:46,010
person doing the best doesn't work it

3290
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:48,200
had Kevin this can do you mind can I ask

3291
02:24:46,010 --> 02:24:50,210
a question and just say fucking I don't

3292
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:51,980
have the answer for you obviously if you

3293
02:24:50,209 --> 02:24:53,719
can't answer but yeah yeah how do you

3294
02:24:51,979 --> 02:24:55,609
how do you and cookies determine what

3295
02:24:53,719 --> 02:24:59,659
the price point is on your pot next year

3296
02:24:55,610 --> 02:25:02,360
in that contract you know it if a lot of

3297
02:24:59,659 --> 02:25:04,190
it works off of your the when you're

3298
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:06,370
when you're going through a supply chain

3299
02:25:04,190 --> 02:25:10,010
that with all the processes or controls

3300
02:25:06,370 --> 02:25:12,380
they know how much the product has to

3301
02:25:10,010 --> 02:25:14,059
cost in order for those touch points to

3302
02:25:12,379 --> 02:25:17,989
make money through the chain for them to

3303
02:25:14,059 --> 02:25:20,059
so you get an idea and the whole point

3304
02:25:17,989 --> 02:25:21,979
of like the appellation situation just

3305
02:25:20,059 --> 02:25:25,399
like the farmers reserve is to bring up

3306
02:25:21,979 --> 02:25:28,039
higher attention to a product it starts

3307
02:25:25,399 --> 02:25:30,829
to allow for you to have a little higher

3308
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:33,410
pricing for the farmer because the

3309
02:25:30,829 --> 02:25:36,379
actual untrimmed I'm a little less

3310
02:25:33,409 --> 02:25:39,049
trimmed and a bigger container saves you

3311
02:25:36,379 --> 02:25:42,799
money on packaging and trimming so the

3312
02:25:39,049 --> 02:25:45,109
way you approach the final piece has to

3313
02:25:42,799 --> 02:25:47,239
be backwards from the retail because

3314
02:25:45,110 --> 02:25:48,409
ultimately people are saying pounds is

3315
02:25:47,239 --> 02:25:51,350
gonna go for a hundred bucks and I'm

3316
02:25:48,409 --> 02:25:53,629
like well it cost 160 just to grow the

3317
02:25:51,350 --> 02:25:54,229
fucking pound so how can I sell it 400

3318
02:25:53,629 --> 02:25:57,739
bucks if it's

3319
02:25:54,229 --> 02:25:59,421
sixty-two grow it's impossible I got

3320
02:25:57,739 --> 02:26:01,011
fucking taxes the taxes are more than

3321
02:25:59,421 --> 02:26:03,921
the prices people quote and I'm just

3322
02:26:01,011 --> 02:26:06,829
like it's impossible the taxes dictate

3323
02:26:03,921 --> 02:26:09,200
the price through the chain and then the

3324
02:26:06,829 --> 02:26:11,569
idea is to figure out how do we overtime

3325
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:13,250
get our desirability up was what you'll

3326
02:26:11,569 --> 02:26:15,649
do is you'll create the desirability

3327
02:26:13,250 --> 02:26:19,550
because you're collecting things from

3328
02:26:15,649 --> 02:26:21,710
diverse groups better quality and pretty

3329
02:26:19,550 --> 02:26:23,060
soon that becomes your label where

3330
02:26:21,710 --> 02:26:25,189
people come to you for a better quality

3331
02:26:23,060 --> 02:26:27,380
product and so because of that you'll be

3332
02:26:25,190 --> 02:26:30,110
able to put a premium across the board

3333
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:33,289
on it that's reasonable for the customer

3334
02:26:30,110 --> 02:26:36,110
but also gives another point to everyone

3335
02:26:33,290 --> 02:26:38,150
downstream from you which then gives you

3336
02:26:36,110 --> 02:26:40,159
long term shit if you are not making

3337
02:26:38,149 --> 02:26:42,619
money we do business forever it's when

3338
02:26:40,159 --> 02:26:46,220
we start having nobody that we start not

3339
02:26:42,620 --> 02:26:47,480
doing thank you so much it makes all the

3340
02:26:46,220 --> 02:26:49,850
sense in the world it's pretty much like

3341
02:26:47,479 --> 02:26:54,890
reverse engineering yeah you got to go

3342
02:26:49,851 --> 02:27:00,261
backwards from the retail yep thank you

3343
02:26:54,890 --> 02:27:03,640
easy so so I think we'll close on that

3344
02:27:00,261 --> 02:27:06,409
cuz I got a deal with dinner

3345
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:09,619
but we still have like a hundred and

3346
02:27:06,409 --> 02:27:11,960
fifty people tuned in Monday night we're

3347
02:27:09,620 --> 02:27:14,570
gonna have an aquaponics section session

3348
02:27:11,960 --> 02:27:19,520
with Steve Ray's near potent ponics

3349
