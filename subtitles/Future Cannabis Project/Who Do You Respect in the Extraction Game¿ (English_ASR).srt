1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:07,080
besides yourselves as you look at two

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,030
other people doing extraction do you

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:15,298
respect even if it's something like I

4
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:18,390
wouldn't why I do test some of the best

5
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:27,210
extractor in Kalia there is a lot of

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:30,268
them that I respect he'll connect the

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,450
two of the two of the two twin days of

8
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:37,229
it there is a bunch of them because

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:39,690
because by using butane they have the

10
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:42,929
ability to capture them over a tile tap

11
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:46,589
an and they produce projects at our

12
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:49,799
amazing that I have no hesitancy like

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,530
it's in the you teammate tool to capture

14
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,718
the most volatile Turpin and to separate

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,760
every compound that the plant is giving

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,850
you so and I come from the perfume

17
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:03,119
industry so I have a lot of respect for

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,978
it it's not because I am stuck in my

19
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,950
niche there is already so much for me to

20
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:12,569
learn just about ashes that is like

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,790
there is despite the fascination an

22
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,919
attraction that I live for I have for

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,860
extraction there is no way I can

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:25,640
dedicate time to it you know what I mean

25
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,640
because it's another monster altogether

26
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:36,590
I mean like Frenchie said some most of

27
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:39,500
the best hash and Cali probably doesn't

28
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:43,549
even hit the dispensary like it's

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:46,879
ridiculous it's ridiculous that you

30
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:49,039
can't make hash on your farm like it's

31
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:53,539
ridiculous that they won't let you you

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,610
know get some bubble bags and do it kind

33
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,470
of old-school so a lot of those I feel

34
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:03,439
like a lot of those clash makers have

35
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:05,659
been left behind but it's it's kind of

36
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,949
cool for them because they don't have to

37
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:19,129
worry about taxes laws and it's so like

38
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:21,530
small-scale I think they do without

39
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:31,340
those constraints like I would love to

40
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:34,909
not have to worry about when you're

41
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,370
making hash and all all the new laws all

42
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:39,789
the packaging laws yesterday I was

43
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:44,180
sitting at least a good 6,000 units

44
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:47,689
because the rnd test didn't match the

45
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,780
compliance test proposin see everyone

46
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:53,329
just like oops and I'm like cool that's

47
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,310
what I spent my day doing I mean as the

48
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,250
hash maker I don't think I should be

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,890
reoccurring stuff there's no for small

50
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,689
companies there's no option like you you

51
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:08,839
got to go in and get it done you got

52
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:11,389
orders to do so yeah I mean yeah I mean

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:17,629
when the Golden State Warriors are

54
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:19,458
playing you try to get people to work so

55
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:23,060
I mean as harsh makers there's so many

56
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:25,479
talented ones one that are not in the

57
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,479
market

58
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:37,949
I think what's really beautiful is

59
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,500
seeing all the half hash makers have

60
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:44,189
their own little niche like their okay

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,039
like some people like Rosen's some

62
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:49,500
people like you know rosin that's

63
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,419
buttery some people like broken rosin

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,000
everyone's kind of expressing themselves

65
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:56,579
and all these manners and I think that's

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,159
super cool that they have that mastery

67
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,870
over the plant I come from a completely

68
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,870
different school of thought where I'm

69
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:10,348
like if the farmer is good the hash will

70
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:13,560
be good surely you don't have reason in

71
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:16,319
your head I mean I like full spectrum

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:23,970
but I like full spectrum hash I like

73
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:26,610
smoking full spectrum - we're doing a

74
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,190
show your petty limited opening is to be

75
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:33,000
to have that wall new play field with

76
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:36,719
CBD and then because we have CBI CBD we

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,418
can play around with ICBC with ith CV we

78
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,970
can play around with a lot of main the

79
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:44,549
main can I'm in a weight of the of the

80
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,919
specific train but it's like it's patchy

81
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,728
limited but at the same time like I was

82
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:55,349
telling you like when you make us in in

83
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:58,319
in my inner inner region in in the body

84
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:01,500
of the and project there is a matrix

85
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:04,800
that created all this cannabinoid and

86
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:08,038
all just happen like in a wine you need

87
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,400
the skin to make the wine you can

88
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:13,800
extract our alcohol from the seeds and

89
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,870
from the juice but you cannot make wine

90
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:22,160
if you don't have that matrix that

91
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:25,560
created the juice and and the sugar so

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,990
when we go into the world of extraction

93
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,769
they have an expansion and the domain of

94
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,960
g vs EG that is fucking on

95
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:36,918
that we don't have when you make

96
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:41,299
traditional ash so it's like it's all

97
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:44,439
under the concentrate umbrella but we

98
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:48,710
are closer to the entourage effect and

99
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:51,469
the main gift of the plant but of play

100
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:57,519
feed is much more limited than even guy

101
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:59,990
making awesome because so clean stuff up

102
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,359
thank you you take you take the juice

103
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,418
from the from the food when you do Ozzy

104
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,699
in you extract but you just with

105
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:10,939
mechanical separation you can do some

106
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:13,970
crazy stuff that we didn't think we

107
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:16,158
could farm and not even two years ago so

108
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:19,220
thank you to see every different new

109
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:22,009
type of consistency okay the way hash is

110
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:25,550
moving in the u.s. I mean it's it's like

111
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:29,288
it's at the forefront at experimenting

112
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,288
in all those little things
