00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,079
[Music]

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,920
I was driving in my car yesterday and I

3
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:21,679
heard on NPR I was just randomly on NPR

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,160
there's a whole story about this

5
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,118
conference happening and uh I hear Susan

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,198
come on and say you know there's a lot

7
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,320
of business conferences out there but

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,879
this one isn't business conference this

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,840
is about the the politics and and uh and

10
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:39,159
the and the and the cause and and all

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,680
that's that's happening uh out here is

12
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,159
what comes on and I

13
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,640
went I'm supposed to give a keynote

14
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:49,878
about about the top seven investment

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:53,280
Trends what am I going to do um and uh

16
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:54,759
and so but so on the way in and I'm

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,000
thinking to myself you know usually when

18
00:00:54,759 --> 00:01:00,358
I speak at business conferences when I

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,759
speak at investment conferences I tend

20
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,439
to put on my activist and inspiration

21
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,478
hat and try and like really rally people

22
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:11,919
to get behind the

23
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,280
cause um whereas everybody else is

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,840
talking about really kind of hard

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,478
business type stuff and uh and so I

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,040
decided to kind of switch it up a little

27
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:22,519
bit for this since this is maybe less of

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,118
a business audience and maybe more of a

29
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:30,039
of a policy audience um which is to

30
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:34,158
actually go a little bit more into the

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:39,759
uh kind of hard sort of business uh uh

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:42,040
kind of topics in in this uh and so I'll

33
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
you know it's really hard for me to not

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,880
talk inspirationally about this

35
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,319
important cause but I'm going to try and

36
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:51,438
hold back as much as I can to be able to

37
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:54,639
download as much kind of business stuff

38
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:57,038
that I can in the short period of time

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,680
uh that we have top five cannabis

40
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,519
investment Trends um and before I get

41
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,920
into into these let me just say that

42
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:08,478
when I say top five cannabis investment

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,479
Trends these aren't necessarily the top

44
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,599
five places where money is going um I'm

45
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:18,199
talking about kind of the top five most

46
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:20,318
sort of unique or uh interesting trends

47
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,238
that I've seen uh come around that I

48
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,799
think have a lot of big implications

49
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,280
about where the Cannabis industry uh

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,280
could be going uh in the coming years uh

51
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,318
and also

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,080
you know we hear from about 20 to 30

53
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,919
companies every week that want to

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,760
present to our investors and we Whittle

55
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,759
that down to two or three a week that we

56
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,318
put on a webinar and then there's this

57
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,919
whole online platform where investors

58
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,839
get to kind of look at deals and share

59
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,759
due diligence and all of this kind of

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,280
stuff so we've now seen thousands and

61
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,799
thousands of pitches and so this is kind

62
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,759
of gleaned from some of the things that

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,080
I'm seeing uh that are kind of I think

64
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:06,878
interesting from a investment standpoint

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,680
um and I'll also just say on some of

66
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,199
these like don't shoot the messenger um

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,159
this is just kind of what's

68
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:17,959
Happening um so let's let's let's hit

69
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:20,719
let's hit the first one um which is

70
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:25,120
limited investment into limited

71
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:27,639
licensing particularly in Canada um but

72
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,158
really limited licensing anywhere people

73
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:34,079
are very very excited about and it's

74
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:38,639
because of uh High barriers to entry uh

75
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,120
creates a uh really concentrated benefit

76
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,679
and so as people are starting to give

77
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,519
these licenses out uh the more

78
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,120
concentrated the benefit the more people

79
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,239
want to fight hard and will spend a lot

80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,239
of money and do whatever they can to get

81
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,158
those very very few licenses uh that are

82
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,799
available and there's a trend in

83
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,239
particularly the Northeast um but also

84
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,879
in in markets in Canada where you've got

85
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,799
these really huge facilities uh that are

86
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:08,840
that are occurring and so investors are

87
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,719
very excited I mean when people you know

88
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,319
ask well what's the what's the biggest

89
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,079
investment opportunity right now it's

90
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:18,199
like well if you can get a uh if you can

91
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,199
get a license in a really limited

92
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,160
licensing environment that is probably

93
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,879
the the biggest opportunity and it's one

94
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,240
that will disappear uh very shortly as

95
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,478
soon as more places uh come on board um

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,038
thankfully in California it looks like

97
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,519
that it's going to be a lot more open

98
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:38,478
than that I mean it's still limited but

99
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,399
it's not it's um it's not so limited

100
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:45,159
that there's such a highly concentrated

101
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:47,478
benefit in one place and so uh I think

102
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,320
that's going to be the one of the big

103
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:52,399
questions that we have going forward

104
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,839
when there's limited licensing then the

105
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,399
real investment opportunity tends to be

106
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,879
in either cultivation or dispensing

107
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:03,279
depending on um you you know what the

108
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,159
relationship the ratio is between those

109
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,879
two and then in states that are more

110
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,919
open uh where there's a lot of

111
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,478
cultivation licenses a lot of dispensary

112
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:17,399
licenses then the opportunity tends to

113
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:19,000
be uh in the product manufacturer uh

114
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,079
angle of it that that's where the real

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,439
opportunity is and uh it's one of the

116
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,879
reasons why we're seeing so much

117
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:28,439
investment I think in California into

118
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,279
Brands uh because I think the real a

119
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,639
really big opportunity will be

120
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:40,599
in in that area um so let's go to the

121
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,840
next one so genetics biofarma and

122
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,039
testing you know we've got this really

123
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,119
interesting thing happening right now

124
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,399
where people who've been working with

125
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,720
this plant underground um or in the in

126
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:59,120
the gray area for many many decades are

127
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,039
finally able to be uh working with uh

128
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,199
you know the top engineers and top uh

129
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:08,279
scientists in the in the world to really

130
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:11,038
be able to take this plant in different

131
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,679
directions um and this is the part where

132
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,918
hey you know Don't Kill the Messenger

133
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,240
but there's like a lot of really

134
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,758
interesting things happening uh when it

135
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,800
comes to you know even companies that

136
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:25,840
are creating canabo with yeast there's

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,439
there's investment happening um in in

138
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,119
these types of uh applications where

139
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:34,079
there isn't even a plant that creating

140
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,199
the the compound um you have a lot of

141
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,639
advancement in testing technology uh and

142
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,199
this is an area where I think cannabis

143
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,680
may be able to lead the entire testing

144
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:49,598
industry because you have um in some

145
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,160
ways less regulation and more demand and

146
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:55,560
it's more easy for this industry to be

147
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,000
willing to uh accept new ideas because

148
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,478
there's nothing there's not as much

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,079
there to start with in the first place

150
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,120
and there's so much growth

151
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:07,120
and so particularly miniatur

152
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,478
miniaturization of testing uh as well as

153
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,240
getting more testing around genetics and

154
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:13,598
things like that so that we know that

155
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,079
you know this this strain is really

156
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,159
means this strain and all of this stuff

157
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,680
around that there's a lot of ancillary

158
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,840
businesses all related um to testing

159
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,000
biofarma and

160
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:33,799
genetics next one

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,279
um feeling ings and lowd do um and and

162
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,280
when I say feelings I don't mean like I

163
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:42,918
mean like uh like you know happy or

164
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:46,719
creative or

165
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:50,120
um uh you know relaxed these sorts of

166
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,720
feelings right so um there was I think

167
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,720
probably the first company to really

168
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,759
kind of swing at this uh was a company

169
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,919
called Ebu but now there's a number of

170
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,280
companies that are really trying to look

171
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:03,719
at how to create a r

172
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:06,758
repeatable uh experience for the wide

173
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,000
range of of consumers out there who have

174
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,400
really chosen not to consume cannabis

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,279
because one time you know maybe eight

176
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,878
eight time eight times out of 10 they

177
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:19,638
enjoy it but the two times are enough to

178
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:22,199
make them not want to do it again uh and

179
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,519
and and also people just wanting to dial

180
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,919
in their experience more and for the

181
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,519
average consumer like figuring out the

182
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,719
differences between all the different

183
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:35,000
strains and how they relate to their own

184
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,360
experience is mindboggling I mean I

185
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,120
include myself in that category um which

186
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,158
is and I'm as exposed to all of this as

187
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,600
as anybody and I'm sorry I just I can't

188
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,080
I can't nerd out on the strain names and

189
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,480
the and the and the way that they impact

190
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,720
me like I kind of like how do I want to

191
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,839
feel right now okay give me that right

192
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,560
and I don't and I and I'm luckily I'm

193
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,440
surrounded by people who are like really

194
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:01,119
into into the plant and all the new

195
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,200
nuances and so I can say I want to feel

196
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,480
like this and they can go okay here take

197
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,399
this but we got to cut the middleman out

198
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,159
and um and that is one area that I think

199
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,519
is getting a get get a lot of investment

200
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,399
um uh over the over the coming years uh

201
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,480
in terms of developing brands that are

202
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,120
able to to do that and that's both a

203
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,680
branding question and a product

204
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,360
development question um certainly The

205
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,639
Branding plays a big role in being able

206
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,639
to deliver that but there's

207
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:33,759
also uh the actual formulation to be

208
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,360
able to give someone that experience and

209
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,360
when you've got a plant that you know

210
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,399
where the experience is so

211
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,039
subjective um I question whether or not

212
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,278
it's even going to be possible to create

213
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:49,599
that repeatable experience um but

214
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,639
certainly there's a lot to be gained if

215
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:57,480
somebody can really crack that

216
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:59,838
nut uh next one um automated trimming um

217
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:06,000
again don't shoot the messenger

218
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:08,040
um uh but automated trimming is you know

219
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,958
is one of those areas where it's this

220
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:13,240
absolutely huge huge labor expense and

221
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,958
as we move into sort of oia standards

222
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,839
and we move into uh situations where

223
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,559
carpal dealing with carpal tunnel and

224
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,959
all of this kind of stuff um coming up

225
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:27,759
with different solutions uh that are

226
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:31,039
going to keep the plants in intact um at

227
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:33,000
the same time as uh being able to

228
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,439
quickly move through the trimming

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,720
process um I think is an area where

230
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,480
we're going to start seeing a lot more

231
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,519
uh investment and I think there's a lot

232
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,600
of reluctance among current um

233
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,440
cultivators um who have been in this for

234
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,720
a long time to really try out these

235
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,880
sorts of things but I think newer people

236
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,278
that are that are coming in are like

237
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:59,399
totally they totally want to figure out

238
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:01,200
a different solution here and uh and so

239
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,919
I think that's going to be interesting

240
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,720
and remember that this is this doesn't

241
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:06,799
happen our industry doesn't happen in a

242
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,560
vacuum there's this whole robotics

243
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,639
industry that's just totally taking off

244
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:14,919
uh where we're able to the prices are

245
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,919
reducing and people can start building

246
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:19,360
like robots doing interesting things

247
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:22,039
like in their home in their basements uh

248
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,200
and so there's a lot of opportunity uh

249
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:27,240
with those things intersecting uh that

250
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,278
could um also continually drive down the

251
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,159
price of cannabis which is also another

252
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,240
topic that I'm not going to get into

253
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,120
here because I know other people have

254
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,799
but as we think about the future and how

255
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,399
to adjust to it uh this is one of the

256
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:45,759
things that is going to continue to

257
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:50,720
drive prices down uh next next slide um

258
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,720
and then brand IP

259
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,159
licensing the race is on for

260
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:01,560
Brands

261
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:03,759
and we are seeing so so much uh energy

262
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,799
and investment going into companies that

263
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,879
are building Brands and then licensing

264
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:13,159
those Brands out to the licensed

265
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:16,720
producers uh in given States um part of

266
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:20,879
this is driven by the challenge of laws

267
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,639
because you have a situation where you

268
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,360
know you can't send your product across

269
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,959
state lines and so what can you send

270
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,800
across state lines right so you can uh

271
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:34,439
the the the whole you know kind of

272
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:36,319
branding experience can be shared across

273
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,240
uh state lines and then also you have a

274
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,680
lot of processors and producers who in a

275
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,079
brand new market want to be able to like

276
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:47,239
start out ahead of the game and so they

277
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:50,039
want to look to brands that already have

278
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,159
a certain feel and a A vibe and a

279
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:54,958
certain following and so it becomes a a

280
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:58,679
natural uh

281
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,879
pairing there and I think that what

282
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:01,479
you're seeing

283
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,720
with branding is you know it's very

284
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,720
similar to you know it's kind of what

285
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,680
Coca-Cola does um and others do in in in

286
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,199
other sectors that don't even have these

287
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:16,000
same kind of barriers that we have uh in

288
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:17,759
this sector and I think there are some

289
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,600
really interesting examples Around The

290
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,720
Branding and figuring out what's really

291
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,800
going to connect with both today's

292
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:29,240
consumers and um the Futures consumers

293
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,799
of cannabis um and more importantly I

294
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,959
think the one the the audience that's

295
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,639
missed um when they look at today's

296
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,759
cannabis consumers and then they look at

297
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,879
tomorrow's cannabis consumers they're

298
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:43,198
missing and they're missing this a lot

299
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:45,838
in The Branding um is today's current

300
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,958
consumers that are just in the illicit

301
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,880
Market they're just not going to the

302
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:52,479
stores right they're missing that

303
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,958
audience and so I think that's what

304
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,759
we're going everyone's trying to make

305
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:59,239
like the the the the top end everyone's

306
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,680
trying to make the Rolex and if you

307
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,560
really look at what people make and what

308
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:07,799
their disposable income is and the kind

309
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:09,479
of brands that they actually buy um then

310
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,639
when they're when they're not paying a

311
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,920
bunch of money to be in a specialized

312
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:17,600
store play paying an in inflated price

313
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:19,838
um I think that's really particularly as

314
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,360
the as the price of cannabis goes down

315
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,759
hitting that market is going to be uh a

316
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,759
really huge uh opportunity and then

317
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,480
there's the question um when we talk

318
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,079
about sort of you know corporatization

319
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,000
or like what kind of brands are really

320
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:36,838
going to resonate with people this is

321
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,839
where I think consumer Choice can is

322
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,880
really going to make a a huge difference

323
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:44,079
like I notice I see Swami uh over here

324
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,799
in the in the corner right I mean like

325
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:49,439
you know um a brand like Swami right you

326
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,120
it's like it's like you've got a

327
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,720
situation where like I think for a lot

328
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,278
of people that's really going to

329
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,399
resonate um and so we're going to get a

330
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,078
chance to see a lot of interesting

331
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,039
different brands you see the Marley

332
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:05,479
Naturals you see uh open Vapes you see

333
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,799
these different people kind of taking

334
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,480
different angles and it's going to be

335
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,599
very interesting to see what's happening

336
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,120
but I know for a lot of investors they

337
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,920
really believe that the power is going

338
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,560
to be in the brands and here's one of

339
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,919
the beautiful things about the brand

340
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:21,758
play is that it it it allows investors

341
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:24,719
to be involved in an ancillary business

342
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,440
uh because often in most cases these IP

343
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,639
comp these companies that are holding

344
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,160
The Branding um aren't actually touching

345
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:35,399
the they're licensing uh their formula

346
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:40,039
and their um and their their creative

347
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,958
out to uh others and so I think that's

348
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,919
an interesting uh area where I think

349
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,479
we're going to see uh a lot more

350
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,078
investment and then also the other thing

351
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,440
there's so many rules there's so many

352
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:52,159
laws around investing in directly into a

353
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,639
company and so this also it's not just

354
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,000
because it's ancillary it's even within

355
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,000
within various state laws wanting to

356
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,240
invest in ancillary businesses become

357
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,519
comes even more interesting because uh

358
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,879
there's so many regulations uh in so

359
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,399
many states California included um and

360
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:12,759
then um and then there's actually a

361
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:17,839
sixth Trend and I almost didn't include

362
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:20,720
it let's go actually um one more

363
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,680
cool I almost didn't put this uh which

364
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,800
was the sixth trend is that businesses

365
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,799
are starting to really donate to the

366
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:32,758
Cannabis industry is really starting to

367
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:35,399
donate to the politics of this issue uh

368
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,440
um and I didn't I didn't put it in

369
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,879
because I I think I've been sort of the

370
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,759
pi Piper of the industry isn't doing

371
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,838
enough to support the

372
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:48,480
movement and you know we get up at each

373
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,519
one of our events and we're like donate

374
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,839
donate donate if you're not donating and

375
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,720
you're in this industry then you're

376
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,720
shering your responsibility you're a

377
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,720
freeloader you know I mean there's this

378
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,839
whole thing going on and it's been

379
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,959
really hard it's been really really hard

380
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,480
to get a lot of the people involved in

381
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:08,279
the in contributing to the cause and it

382
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,160
it's particularly frustrating for me

383
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,759
because the whole reason I started

384
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,279
arkview in the first place the whole

385
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:18,000
reason I left the the the sort of

386
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,000
movement World full-time and moved into

387
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,199
the business side full-time was because

388
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,119
I believed that business is a powerful

389
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,318
platform for political change and as

390
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,759
soon as we could really Inspire that

391
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,200
that end

392
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,279
that it would become a no-brainer for

393
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,038
businesses and entrepreneurs to be

394
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:37,480
donating to change the laws this is what

395
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:39,839
we learned in the renewable energy

396
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,919
industry right you could you could write

397
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,798
letters to members of Congress all day

398
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,200
long but until you had profitable

399
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,160
businesses that and business models

400
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,798
associated with renewable energy it was

401
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,000
only going to go so far and I I thought

402
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:57,960
that was true about cannabis and about

403
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,079
uh uh changing these laws and that was

404
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,038
the whole reason that Steve D'Angelo and

405
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,519
I started arkview in the first place was

406
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:08,319
based on that belief and here we are six

407
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:11,759
years later we started arkview in

408
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:14,879
2010 and really hoping we would have

409
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,759
been further down the line in people

410
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,159
coming into this industry and investing

411
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,599
into this industry and simultaneously

412
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,679
donating to the

413
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:27,759
cause um but I'm happy to say that in

414
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,038
the last month or so this storyline is

415
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,798
actually starting to change I mean of

416
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:36,279
course it'll never be enough it'll never

417
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:39,599
I'm like I admit that I'm like I'm an

418
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm I'm an activist and and a fundraiser

419
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,240
by by heart and you're never satisfied

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,200
if you're an activist or you're a

421
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,359
fundraiser but I will say that it's

422
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,080
starting they're starting to crack it's

423
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:54,158
starting to happen that people are

424
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:58,240
recognizing that the future of the

425
00:18:54,159 --> 00:19:01,080
market for their uh businesses is really

426
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,079
dependent upon being able to support the

427
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:07,158
cause not just because it opens up more

428
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,720
markets but because it's cause marketing

429
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,960
because it's hard to be in this industry

430
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,480
which was started by by

431
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,880
activists and to actually conduct

432
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,519
business when you're not one of the top

433
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:25,120
people out there contributing to the

434
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:27,119
cause um and so I'm just so grateful

435
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:30,079
that this is an industry birthed out of

436
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:33,519
a movement because it's what's going to

437
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:35,918
make it a new kind of industry and I

438
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,839
hope that we continue to hold businesses

439
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:42,038
feet to the fire to pay for

440
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,359
reform um it's it's bizarre that there's

441
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:45,599
all these people that are going to

442
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,759
benefit and the people who are for the

443
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,359
most part paying to pass these

444
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:52,759
initiatives are the people who aren't

445
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:56,079
even going to benefit um and so that's

446
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,919
got to change over time and uh I can I'm

447
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,359
just looking out in the audience I see

448
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,759
James slat I see others who a lot of

449
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:06,038
people who've really put a lot on the

450
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,919
line um for this for this industry and

451
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,759
while we're sitting here thinking about

452
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,640
what's the best policy or how to make

453
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,519
the most money there are tens of

454
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,919
thousands of people sitting in prison

455
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,798
who wake up every day living in fear and

456
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,159
they wake up living in fear and they're

457
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,599
counting on us they're counting on us to

458
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,200
get this right they're counting on us to

459
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:30,639
not let our petty disagreements get in

460
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,640
the way of getting them out of jail

461
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,918
and so I put this list up of companies

462
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,798
that I know of that are donating at

463
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,280
least

464
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:48,158
$100,000 to uh legalization efforts in

465
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,839
the last year or so uh and uh if you

466
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,760

467
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:56,480
on that list that is not please let me

468
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:59,519
know um and then um we would love to add

469
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,640
them to it but we want to be shouting

470
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,440
from the rooftops the companies that are

471
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,080
really standing up but I also want you

472
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,159
to look at that

473
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:12,519
list and notice who isn't on there um um

474

475
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,839

476
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,599
cannabis businesses in the Cannabis

477
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:22,839

least $100,000 to all of the uh uh

479
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:29,119
