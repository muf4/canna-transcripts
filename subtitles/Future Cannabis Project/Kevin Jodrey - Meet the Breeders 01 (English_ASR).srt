1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,878
[Music]

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:10,079
these people that I respect prior to the

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:13,768
change in regulation and my whole desire

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,240
for that interview series was to propel

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,960
people forward so that they could

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,539
survive and it's really nice to

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,469
interview the same people again that are

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,289
still alive and so their different

9
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:30,358
directions different skillsets different

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,160
desires but all of them you know to me

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,829
premium breeders people that I've used

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,959
to scare people into success with their

13
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,230
material and people that I've used to

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,899
steer my own self into success and so

15
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,159
we're gonna let them basically just chop

16
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,200
up a little only got the one I think

17
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,909
when I go one Mike what we'll do is

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,739
we'll just well let them introduce each

19
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,558
other one by one with what they're doing

20
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,369
and then we'll start getting into some

21
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:55,500
what are you doing right now

22
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:59,549
because all you involved in interesting

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,579
stuff and it's it's an excellent story

24
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,768
to listen to because these people are

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,810
just the same as you where they're

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,420
individuals that that are fighting their

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,920
way through the system and the only way

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,659
that it's going to really work is if

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,000
you're using the material putting it

30
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,740
into play and then they're able to then

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,719
keep creating stuff that you can put

32
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,359
into play so we really have a you know

33
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:26,700
true symbiotic relationship as cultivate

34
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:29,390
or breeder so with that all right thanks

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,390

founded Humboldt seed company in early

47
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:20,349
2000s and I started breeding cannabis in

48
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:24,240
Humboldt County in 1999 when my daughter

49
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:26,620
was born who's here with me and I'm just

go by me and Jean freeborn selections

58
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:04,989
and I've been breeding stuff since the

59
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:08,129
90s keeping stuff since the mid 90s

60
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:10,540
since I was pretty much a kid and just

61
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:14,729
looking through things and trying to

62
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:16,780
make better plants for you know

63
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:19,349
originally just me and my buddy so we

64
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,759
could have something a little better and

65
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:24,400
trying to improve and keep stuff around

66
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:27,419
and not not lose the stuff that's cool

67
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,300
that we want to be able to have and

68
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:34,659

of shining a light on you know the

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:43,090
positive aspect of what can be done and

72
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:47,230
not just dumping a bunch of garbage into

73
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:49,210
the earth to try to make money and yeah

74

so my name is Jason Mathis and I started

77
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:07,589
equilibrium genetics and I want to thank

78
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:09,689
I want to thank keV and you know I mean

79

here and being on the panel with me

81
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:20,389
and so everybody hear me in the back

82
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:22,949
all right good it's really great to have

83
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:25,199
opportunities like this to bring the

84
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,030
community together what's going on right

85
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,439
now in California's breaking my heart

86
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:33,299
it's it's been a long road for me coming

87
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,550
from the East Coast I'm originally from

88
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,069
Northern Virginia and I've been really

89
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:45,240
involved in drug policy activism and I

90
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:48,269
worked a really long time for a number

91
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:53,038
of organizations to help pass laws

92
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:56,189
across the country and when I finally

93
00:04:53,038 --> 00:05:00,240
get to legalization in California and

94
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:02,699
now I see what a monster it is and it's

95
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,918
it's it's just breaking my heart seeing

96
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:08,159
what's happening to our community so so

97
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:10,409
I just want to stress that everybody

98
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,439
just stay vigilant we're you know it's

99
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,139
not over and we're going to improve

100
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:20,209
these laws you know I've seen a lot you

101
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,288
know happen in the past year and it I

102
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:24,029
didn't know if anybody was gonna show up

103
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:26,279
today and just to see this many faces in

104
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:30,319
the room we were still doing this it's

105
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,319
just it's it's really good

106
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:39,589
yeah knowing when I was a good mic I'm

107
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:44,028
gonna pass this one to you guys and I'm

108
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:46,489
gonna take this one right here thank you

109
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:50,509
um when we at the first regen event in

110
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:53,629
Vancouver it it blew my mind and who was

111
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:56,240
there because I realized that that this

112
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:58,819
had grown in this organic way of people

113
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,060
who wanted to actually continue cannabis

114
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:07,129
culture and agricultural integrity and

115
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,769
when I saw the the people that were at

116
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:11,090
the event and I I knew the speakers were

117
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,859
all solid because I looked at the room

118
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:15,138
and I've met a bunch of them but I met

119
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:18,020
the people in the room and I couldn't

120
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:19,400
believe the level of commitment and I

121
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:21,799
said whoa we're definitely gonna be

122
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,929
alright we're gonna have to fight but

123
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,718
there is a lot of people that are about

124
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,728
it and then we have this one here and

125
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:30,439
like I said this isn't my event I'm just

126
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:32,088
a speaker I'm just putting on some of

127
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:33,919
this presentation today but I didn't

128
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:37,158
organize this event I didn't create the

129
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,658
idea I'm a helper so I'm just grateful

130
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:40,519
to be part of it but it blew my mind

131
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:44,870
when we had to go find another venue

132
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:46,938
because it was too big and and that's

133
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,528
not bad and so from Jason's point of

134
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:52,338
view someone who came from the south

135
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:54,139
where you extremely regulated he and he

136
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:56,269
comes out to California and gets

137
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,250
involved in the industry and then sees

138
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:59,658
the changes and for him to say whoa I

139
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,668
didn't expect to see anybody and lo and

140
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:02,209
behold you know you see a building it's

141
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:05,810
huge

142
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:07,549
so there's a we're gonna jump around

143
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,769
folks we have some time you know and I

144
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,829
want to get into some information about

145
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:15,079
you know um what do you use the base

146
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:16,370
material you do what are you doing but

147
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,478
the first thing I wanted hit that cuz I

148
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,189
haven't had a chance to chat with him is

149
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:22,519
enacted something interesting where he

150
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:24,409
did a giant mega phyno hunt and he he

151
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,370
tied a bunch of people into it so that

152
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:27,288
he could actually get the number of

153
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,399
participants required to look at

154
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:30,800
material in all these different

155
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,259
circumstances and situation and he's use

156
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,079
that orange photonics box so to be able

157
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:37,338
to do a lot of the metrics himself and

158
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,478
we never got a chance to chat about it

159
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:39,528
and I just think it was awesome and I

160
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,788
don't know if it got covered enough

161
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:42,659
really because I don't know if anybody

162
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:45,788
hunted a population that big

163
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,860
here so I mean you you might be an ofc

164
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:50,110
like uh I come from a family of whalers

165
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,030
historic whalers and so there's always a

166
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:57,788
joke that we're out wailing that's

167
00:07:52,029 --> 00:08:02,189
wailing you know looking for that white

168
00:07:57,788 --> 00:08:04,930
whale and I definitely went crazy so

169
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:09,908
maybe I should name a strain Moby Dick

170
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:13,750
yourself anyways thanks keV

171
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:19,569
so I guess sort of the impetus for that

172
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:21,788
was just this practice of being a type

173
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:24,669
hunting and it's something that I know

174
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:26,769
you know all of us have really probably

175
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:29,829
done in our lives whether it was like in

176
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:33,759
an organized an intentional way or

177
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:35,889
whether we you know read our own seeds

178
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,139
and I mean how many people in here are

179
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:40,929
our breeders like have how many people

180
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:51,309
have either even accidentally you know

181
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:56,739
right so you know I mean it's it's

182
00:08:51,309 --> 00:09:02,078
something that that I think can can be

183
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:07,980
done collaboratively and can sort of

184
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:10,569
feed back into what we kind of need in

185
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:15,730
in our community where you know we don't

186
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:19,209
have access to quite as ample flat Ag

187
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,459
land and maybe we don't you know maybe

188
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:24,489
our County makes it harder than it

189
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:27,338
really needs to be to have permits and

190
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:31,750
get licenses and so I think one of the

191
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:37,270
strategies can just be to to use our

192
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:40,289
innovation and so doing that in a

193
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:43,480
collaborative way with a bunch of people

194
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:48,429
seemed like it might be you know a good

195
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,200
idea and so we started that last or 2017

196
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:51,578
in the fall we kind of came up with the

197
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,560
idea and

198
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:57,620
ended up I think around like 15

199
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:03,069
different farms or groups tied into it

200
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:07,419
and went around had a few big events and

201
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:10,970
the the process involved taking a lot of

202
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:14,569
cuttings before flower and keeping them

203
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:17,860
alive and of course a lot of labeling

204
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:20,990
from the field to the to the clone room

205
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:26,289
making sure that that didn't get messed

206
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:28,879
up and so that was quite an effort and

207
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:33,769
definitely some of the folks in this

208
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:36,289
room were we're on that team and they

209
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:39,889
know how hard it was like I think Daniel

210
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:44,929
took 3 or 400 of them himself

211
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:47,379
right so anyways just kind of coming

212
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:52,039
together like that in a group effort and

213
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:56,328
trying to really improve genetic lines I

214
00:10:52,039 --> 00:11:00,319
mean I have a group of friends at Davis

215
00:10:56,328 --> 00:11:05,750
that I ended up getting close with doing

216
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:10,129
like salmon genomics research and you

217
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:13,669
know they're really very brilliant

218
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:15,799
geneticists and kind of a question that

219
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:18,919
I had said was like well what are we

220
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:22,039
gonna do you can go out and find markers

221
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:23,809
and do all this fancy marker-assisted

222
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:27,559
breeding and all this stuff like that

223
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:31,518
and they kind of said you know what you

224
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:33,319
guys kind of already are doing what you

225
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,629
really should be doing which is just

226
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,760
like hunting through populations

227
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:42,620
I mean cannabis is like this exciting

228
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:46,338
really brand new thing and so even

229
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:50,470
though we're all facing down the barrel

230
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:54,760
of Corporate America coming with its

231
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:57,379
free markets and commodity pricing I

232
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:59,528
think you know there is still a lot of

233
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:02,649
exciting things to do and they said the

234
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:05,389
no matter what the

235
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:09,019
Syngenta's in the monsanto's no matter

236
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:13,009
how heavy they come in with biotech in

237
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:14,990
and the capabilities of you know mass

238
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:20,360
sequencing and all that stuff it really

239
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:24,740
takes a human who knows the plant really

240
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,839
well to be able to even you know inform

241
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,139
any of that stuff so they're still years

242
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:33,519
away and they still have to learn about

243
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:36,500
this plant that we all know so well

244
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,980
because we've worked with it for years

245
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,509
so you know when all hope is lost I

246
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:47,990
think sometimes it's you can just

247
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:51,139
remember that like we're a powerful you

248
00:12:47,990 --> 00:13:01,730
know we're powerful contingent if we're

249
00:12:51,139 --> 00:13:07,789
a collaborative contingent and you know

250
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:08,300
they can't what is on it but anyway I

251
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:11,778
don't know

252
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:13,490
so phenotype hunting I mean I think you

253
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:15,769
know gene you want to talk about

254
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,379
phenotype on thing well I was gonna ask

255
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:19,938
you you we can go into the piece but I

256
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:21,769
was some stuff that all three you're

257
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:23,269
doing that are interesting right and so

258
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:25,669
I wanted to give a chance for you to

259
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,679
talk about the mega Fino hunt and the

260
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:30,620
fact that I don't think anybody really

261
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,719
understood the scope of what you did it

262
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,730
was a big I'm somebody who likes to hunt

263
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,920
populations and I'm like oh you were

264
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,778
hunting a big population and you had a

265
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,659
lot of people helping you had a lot of

266
00:13:38,778 --> 00:13:44,269
people involved that's a logistical

267
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:46,039
nightmare you got to use some modern

268
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:47,629
equipment that was portable to allow you

269
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:49,578
to be able to afford to do it because

270
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,679
holy Christ having a lab test that much

271
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,028
stuff would have bankrupted you and then

272
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,909
so then all of a sudden you become a

273
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:56,778
competent field lab operator because

274
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:58,278
you're having to make sure that the

275
00:13:56,778 --> 00:14:00,350
tests are actually standardized so they

276
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:01,490
they make sense and I think that that

277
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,079
was just something I thought was awesome

278
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,289
and and I just didn't see enough

279
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:08,359
coverage of it magine and I fit for the

280
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:09,588
sake of transparency too I do business

281
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,778
with all these guys meaning that my

282
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:13,459
store carries their products right so

283
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:15,259
this isn't a sales pitch for him but you

284
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:18,679
got to say that otherwise

285
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:20,509
if everybody's trying to push something

286
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,120
in in this case I'm just trying to push

287
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:26,559
what they do but the point is the team

288
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,820
release is all mine three rolls and

289
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,219
that's the first time I see Mean Gene

290
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,620
come out as a pre-roll and it was always

291
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,139
typically all in genetics and the

292
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,269
question was you know are you having to

293
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:40,669
change your lines to work with your

294
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:42,529
you're a new direction in Flour and able

295
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:44,990
to use the existing tools what do you

296
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:47,059
notice in from a breeders point of view

297
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,799
and I and I know that all of you

298
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,019
excellent cultivated suits us most oh

299
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,729
you're so you know what do you having to

300
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:58,549
do to shift into that new realm of

301
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,920
product diversity that you're doing well

302
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:05,449
the the the trip about that was

303
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:07,370
basically that like I myself like I roll

304
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,900
a joint in my hand I hold the weed I

305
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,830
break it in my hand I roll it up and I

306
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:12,019
smoke it right away

307
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,990
like I don't know I don't like to roll

308
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:17,449
my joints and then smoke them later so

309
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,620
like myself I'm like not a pre-roll guy

310
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,700
but the weird thing is that uh

311
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,259
dispensaries people either want to buy a

312
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,550
little bud or they want to buy a joint

313
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:30,439
like that's mostly what it is so

314
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:32,449
basically my buddy was just like hey you

315
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,840
know we got your flavors we want to we

316
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,790
want to put him out and you know he's

317
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,320
like can we stick your name on it and

318
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:41,509
say oh this is your this is this is

319
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,280
these flavors so that there's you know

320
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:45,830
basic brand recognition cuz it's so

321
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,689
important right now for people to be

322
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,100
able to look at something and go okay

323
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,720
I've heard of that I'm gonna try it

324
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,000
people want things on their shelves that

325
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,759
have some recognition to them you know

326
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,549
and it's like the stuff that we all

327
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,549
regard as being like hype like it's like

328
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:03,559
okay there's there's different forms of

329
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:05,299
it and and a big a big part of it is

330
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:06,649
really just brand recognition and

331
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,509
anytime you're selling something you

332
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:12,529
want people to be able to look and go

333
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:13,789
okay I I would buy that so I don't know

334
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,370
the pre-roll thing is funny to me

335
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:17,750
because I was like yeah you can put it

336
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,399
on there don't don't call them pre-rolls

337
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,500
that you gotta call them joints there's

338
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,419
a the whole pre-roll thing is funny I've

339
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,129
had I've made jokes about that for years

340
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:26,049
like you can make it you know how to

341
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:28,389
make a

342
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:31,778
you know you know how to roll a joint

343
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:33,129
you know but um but the trip about it is

344
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:34,958
is that with the whole thing it's like

345
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:37,360
okay now you got the weed now it's got

346
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,369
to get tested now they want you to test

347
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,620
the pre-roll so it has to be rolled up

348
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,629
before the testing takes you forever to

349
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,198
get the testing back and everything and

350
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:49,240
it's so it's like in general for me I'm

351
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,149
like okay well there you're already

352
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,709
looking at it being to me it's degraded

353
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:55,629
but because people are gonna be buying

354
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,859
pre-rolls I'm like well the pre-roll is

355
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:58,689
a pre-roll if the weed was good that

356
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,329
went into it it's gonna be one of one of

357
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,800
the better pre-rolls you know but um but

358
00:17:01,328 --> 00:17:05,500
it's just a trip because of the whole

359
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,838
the way the market is cuz I would like

360
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:13,359
to be able to say okay here this is weed

361
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:15,369
in a jar on the stick hardly trimmed you

362
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,109
can really look at it you can see where

363
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:20,438
those outer leaves super-healthy

364
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:21,879
was it you know how the weed like I like

365
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,110
to look at it like that people always

366
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,120
look at my weed I carry and they're like

367
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,438
you didn't trim it I'm like you yeah I

368
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,759
didn't trim it but look at it you know

369
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,009
you can see what it is you can see the

370
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,720
features you can see how far the resin

371
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:33,579
grows out on the leaves like if someone

372
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,740
gives me weed and it's and it's the big

373
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:37,449
Leafs are moved then I'm happy with that

374
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,058
when I pull off those leaves I'm seeing

375
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,100
it completely untouched but that's not

376
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:43,720
gonna work on the on the market

377
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:45,668
unfortunately because people look at

378
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,279
stuff in a jar they want it just like

379
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:50,230
what people call poodle cut they want to

380
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,089
cut down it's like Oh half the hairs are

381
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,029
cut off yeah but it's it's all bad you

382
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:56,980
know it's like well that's cool but it's

383
00:17:55,029 --> 00:18:00,190
just weird because with the new thing

384
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,569
everything has to be changed and to

385
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,779
touch back on what he was talking about

386
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:07,000
with the value of people who are real

387
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:10,210
weed people in the new paradigm of how

388
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,409
everything is like I just I came to the

389
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:16,120
realization talking to a buddy of mine

390
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:18,640
you know if you really know something

391
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,558
and you really have experience and

392
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,570
you've really done stuff you have an

393
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:26,589
advantage over these people who just

394
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:27,579
have really deep pockets so I'm really

395
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:29,990
disappointed

396
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:35,990
I understand

397
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:38,870
I understand like the reality that

398
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,950
people see okay here's this opportunity

399
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:44,479
so I'm gonna bring this to the table and

400
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,610
basically they have deep pockets and I

401
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,679
have this knowledge but what people are

402
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:50,990
gonna start to understand and I mean

403
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:54,288
like all just tell all you right now so

404
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,190
you can maybe hear it before you have to

405
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:58,849
learn for yourself

406
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:01,250
those people basically you're disposable

407
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:02,808
so information only goes as far as

408
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,569
information goes and as soon as they

409
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:07,190
have your information or they have your

410
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:10,129
whatever they're getting from you

411
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,600
they're gonna throw you away so it

412
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,580
doesn't matter what kind of contract you

413
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,798
have or any of that if these people have

414
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:17,298
that deeper pockets they're there

415
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:22,278
eventually they're gonna shit on you you

416
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:24,379
know so that's just a point that I

417
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:27,409
wanted to bring up that if you have

418
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,028
something and there's the you got these

419
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:30,890
big investors or whoever they are these

420
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:33,230
big corporate dudes and they're like we

421
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,610
we got to have this and they want it all

422
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,798
we're gonna give you all this money and

423
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:39,288
do all this shit like don't give it to

424
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,259
them watch them fail and then help

425
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:44,629
people who you know are actually trying

426
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:47,210
to make it and then you'll have this

427
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,070
huge advantage but the problem is that

428
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,798
we're all down a little bit right now

429
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:53,298
everything's messed up so when you see

430
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:55,398
an opportunity you go well I better not

431
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:57,440
everything's going to shit so I better

432
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:59,808
jump on the opportunities but it's

433
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,038
almost like like an analogy would be

434
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:06,619
like alright well we've almost fished

435
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:08,690
out all the salmon so I should just go

436
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:10,308
fish a shitload before they're gone or

437
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,990
we've almost cut down all the old-growth

438
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:14,148
redwoods so I better cut down my

439
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,470
old-growth redwood before it's gone but

440
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:17,629
people are taking this really priceless

441
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:20,870
valuable stuff and they're giving it to

442
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,490
the man basically and then they're just

443
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:24,849
getting fucked and then these dudes are

444
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,079
coming up with these with this killer

445
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:29,028
you know

446
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,528
these killer ways of operating and in a

447
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:32,690
lot of case they can't really understand

448
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:34,308
it anyway they still need the people but

449
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,019
I've just been seen with a lot of people

450
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:37,190
they're like oh yeah well we we know we

451
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:39,500
need you for this we need you for that

452
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:41,890
people get these jobs they do it it gets

453
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:45,308
a little bit further in and they go

454
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:48,009
you know it's like the old the old Eddie

455
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:49,928
Murphy you know hey what do you say we

456
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:51,579
kick what do you kids say we kick

457
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:53,380
Clarence out of the band and steal all

458
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:54,819
this good ideas with the with the

459
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,010
Beatles you know the fifth Beatle is

460
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:58,808
like okay cool we'll just kick you out

461
00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:00,569
and take all your shit you know and

462
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:02,980
that's kind of what's happening with um

463
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:04,629
with everything and that's what he was

464
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,460
talking about with like okay you have

465
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,350
these things of value so if you have

466
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,669
something of value and people are

467
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:12,069
basically trying to take it from me it's

468
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:15,159
like it's just it's a bummer because a

469
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:18,099
lot of people have really helped the

470
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,870
assholes to get further and then it's

471
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:23,740
not there they're not really gonna wind

472
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:26,319
up getting anything and so if if they

473
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,548
need to take I mean everybody here who's

474
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,168
been doing stuff for a long time

475
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:31,089
remembers when you first tried to grow

476
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:33,159
really good weed and you first tried to

477
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,599
dry it right and you first tried to have

478
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,669
everything come out and you saw your

479
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,648
buddies leading you went and his his

480
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:40,240
weeds always better than mine and that's

481
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:41,648
how these guys would have to deal for a

482
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,829
long time but then they're getting

483
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:46,928
people basically like us to come in and

484
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:48,668
tell them how to do everything right and

485
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:49,960
they're they're basically gonna they're

486
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:52,120
gonna get your ideas and they're gonna

487
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,370
throw you away so as much as you can

488
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:57,428
it's like you wanna these things are so

489
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:59,079
cool because right now I know anybody

490
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:02,409
who wants to come to something like this

491
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,148
isn't a bunch of assholes essentially

492
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:07,299
like all you guys are looking at a

493
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:09,518
different aspect of it and like to me

494
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:11,589
that's that's where it should be going

495
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,899
and that should almost be that should

496
00:22:11,589 --> 00:22:15,369
almost be locked off from the from

497
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:17,798
everything else it's like you want

498
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:20,229
everyone to get the information but at

499
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:21,819
the same time it's like you got a you

500
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,230
got to keep it out of the wrong hands a

501
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:25,028
little bit too cuz it's getting it's

502
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,740
getting watered down and you see it fast

503
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:28,509
and I've just been hearing so many

504
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,250
horror stories from buddies who are like

505
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:31,808
yeah they put me on they're gonna do

506
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,069
this they're gonna use my genetics

507
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,898
they're gonna do all this and then

508
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:36,250
pretty soon they're like damn and then I

509
00:22:34,898 --> 00:22:39,668
showed up at the meeting and they said

510
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:41,380
like I'm out but they got all my ideas I

511
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:42,820
did the whole thing but they're the ones

512
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,169
with the deep pockets and I don't you

513
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,939
don't have lawyers that can battle their

514
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:48,100
lawyer so now what am I gonna do you

515
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,288
know but that anyway I was something

516
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:52,839
that he said and that was you know it's

517
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:55,359
just the new the new thing is crazy so

518
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:57,389
try to you know what brought that to

519
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,619
was talking about like mmm you know

520
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:02,020
being able to market being able to

521
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:04,059
leverage things trying to basically find

522
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:07,180
the people to help out who you know are

523
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:09,609
like-minded and don't just look for the

524
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:12,220
the Golden Goose and try to jump on it

525
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:14,139
keep you can keep your thing small you

526
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,759
can do something you can still just grow

527
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,580
some weed you can still just sell a

528
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,140
little and not chase after this idea

529
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:21,399
it's like it's got to be two worlds

530
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,960
because there's the one world that's

531
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,190
going on that everybody's overly

532
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,110
ambitious going for that and then

533
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,779
there's the world that basically all you

534
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:31,509
guys are in and it just like really

535
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:33,129
don't even get caught up thinking that

536
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:36,579
any of that has any value

537
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,200
really for any of us you know but no no

538
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:40,629
it's it's real you you have to believe

539
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,110
that yeah you the problem is that people

540
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:46,380
think that if you don't get it solved

541
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:50,229
right now you're not gonna solve it and

542
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:53,230
you didn't get here in a year took your

543
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,779
whole life to get here yeah so so you

544
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,490
might just keep marching forward and be

545
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:59,440
intelligent and for me people try to

546
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,900
access stuff for me but it's I'm good at

547
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,779
picking up sneaky shit and so I like to

548
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,460
play with you but the new people are

549
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:08,589
coming to pick it up and they send

550
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,809
people to talk to you but the thing is

551
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:12,819
they have a very directed questioning

552
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:16,269
that's and you can pick it up because

553
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:18,849
it's it's not organically derived it's

554
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:22,000
scripted and then once you get that now

555
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:24,219
you can trounce those guys too and be

556
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,859
careful with who you endorse if you have

557
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,079
a good reputation for what you do be

558
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:30,819
careful because they could take it from

559
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:32,619
you and then it's no longer yours and

560
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:34,509
that's what you've worked for this whole

561
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:37,029
time really is a level of integrity and

562
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:38,589
Trust to where nobody's perfect but for

563
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:41,200
the most part you're pretty reliable

564
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:43,629
that's something that is is called

565
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,569
goodwill in business and goodwill is

566
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:48,850
very very valuable and the people that

567
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:51,609
are coming in need the goodwill so they

568
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:54,339
can then make their marketing occur and

569
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:57,009
get trust and buy-in and what you get

570
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:58,149
left is is basically nothing and it

571
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:00,460
doesn't mean you can't work with

572
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:02,980
individuals but like in my case if I do

573
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,590
anything contractual I have my own

574
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,720
lawyers right the contracts and I pay

575
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,919
for that so I have my own lawyers come

576
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,190
with me even though people don't know no

577
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,360
we

578
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,799
need a lawyer I said yeah I always need

579
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:13,569
a lawyer when I go to court I bring an

580
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:14,919
attorney because I know they're gonna

581
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:17,019
talk a language that I really don't

582
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,600
understand and I always equate it to

583
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:21,039
bring in Mike Tyson to a bar fight that

584
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:22,569
if you had to get into a bar fight and

585
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,119
you might with Mike Tyson you would say

586
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:26,439
I got this I'm really good at this let

587
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,799
me handle this part of it

588
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,620
and you now just keep an eye on my back

589
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,740
and that's kind of how I see the stuff

590
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:36,909
that we're working with but man you know

591
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,529
every time you have to put the money out

592
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,630
to cover the attorney to do the deal

593
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:42,339
it's your money and they're their cash

594
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,600
driving us and that's really why we

595
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:45,579
don't we always bring back to that

596
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,259
common that the people around you are

597
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:48,819
the ones that you got here with and

598
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:51,009
they're the ones that you're gonna have

599
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:54,369
to team up with and share resources with

600
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:56,230
and in some cases it's not a bad thing

601
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:59,349
to put the farm down for a season and

602
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:01,750
not farm it if you can't afford to make

603
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:03,639
that product sell it'd be better to let

604
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,349
it sit for season and go get a job

605
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,810
working with your other friends on their

606
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:09,609
farm and then pick up the operation

607
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:11,889
again because I let my own farm sit last

608
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:13,959
year the way the way it worked with

609
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:16,120
permitting was they wanted to put me off

610
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,549
until August on a plant and I said no

611
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:21,339
why would I want a plant in August so I

612
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:23,079
said it's better that I don't and I

613
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:25,329
won't pay the excise I won't have to pay

614
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:27,159
the taxes and I'll just have to make

615
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:28,480
sure I work harder on my other stuff

616
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,340
because I'm not gonna get there the

617
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,559
income that I had hoped to get from the

618
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:35,199
farm but I also realized that there was

619
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,059
no guarantee on the income either and so

620
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,910
if you start playing this game of

621
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:41,919
desperation you put yourself in a

622
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,570
situation you can't get out of and if

623
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,460
you take a look at your whole life every

624
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:46,990
major screw-up you made you made out of

625
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,329
desperation because it took away good

626
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:52,509
judgment and so this is some important

627
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:54,789
stuff to really understand Jason Jason's

628
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:57,099
been a busy boy man you're somebody that

629
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:58,659
like I follow the drops and I mean I

630
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:01,659
don't know if anybody drives more than

631
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,220
him like literally when I met him at his

632
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,290
his car looked like he had put it

633
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,259
together with duct tape and he's like

634
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:10,539
bro I'm doing a lot of driving and then

635
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:13,809
I see him in a new car and he's like bro

636
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:15,909
I'm doing a lot of driving and but he's

637
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:19,679
getting his product out into the market

638
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:22,450
in a really good way and it's

639
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,609
interesting product and so you know

640
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,528
what do you been doing thank you thank

641
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:30,908
you keV yeah I've been I've been busy

642
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:34,450
that's for sure and still investor free

643
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:41,799
still broke still just in the struggle

644
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:44,558
like all you it was really good listen

645
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:46,720
you guys talk because the the Sharks are

646
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,608
out there and it was everything you guys

647
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,019
are saying is everything that I've been

648
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:52,509
going through for the past couple years

649
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:54,368
and just feeling desperate feeling like

650
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:56,499
you want to go talk to these people that

651
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:58,599
say that they got solutions for you and

652
00:27:56,499 --> 00:28:00,608
they really don't at the end they just

653
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:03,009
want to hear you talk they just want to

654
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:05,048
you know put the tape on record and let

655
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:07,269
you just go and so okay so we captured

656
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:09,028
that alright now let's go tempt the next

657
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,649
guy and try to get what he's got and

658
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:13,329
none of those none of those things ever

659
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,949
amounted to anything other than nice

660
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:20,829
building my wheels in front of a bunch

661
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:22,210
of people and Maduro just going and

662
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:23,648
getting a job working for somebody else

663
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:27,249
if that was what I was going to keep

664
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:29,229
doing it's exactly what you said you you

665
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:32,019
you maybe you get a contract even that

666
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:34,690
solid is can be and they can still

667
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:36,429
switch things up a month or two down the

668
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,288
road they've got your cuts they've got

669
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:40,690
your seeds or whatever they've got all

670
00:28:38,288 --> 00:28:42,308
your plan and how you do it and then now

671
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,590
they got some other dude they hired for

672
00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:46,960
$12 an hour to go and do everything that

673
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:49,209
you were doing and that's not going to

674
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,429
happen if you're self-employed doing it

675
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,730
for you with your friends with people

676
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:57,059
that you have real relationships with

677
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:57,058
and so

678
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,360
yeah and so I'm still I'm still

679
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:11,079
struggling I'm still at this I'm still

680
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:13,419
driving miles and you know and hopefully

681
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:15,669
for many more years I came here you know

682
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:18,250
to California almost you know penniless

683
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:20,110
the few hundred bucks in my pocket lived

684
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:25,329
in a bathroom for seven months and in

685
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:27,719
East Oakland and you know I I still go

686
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:30,789
back to there sometimes where it's like

687
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,569
I'm doing alright I was alright then and

688
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:34,509
I'm alright now

689
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:37,480
you know so it's it's all about feeling

690
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:39,910
inside you and and getting desperate is

691
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,819
like it's kind of like you have this

692
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,470
vision of like oh I could be with this

693
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:49,720
big group doing all these fancy things

694
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:52,660
but like you there's you're not going to

695
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,509
do that or it's very unlikely and then

696
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:58,269
you then you try to see what kind of

697
00:29:55,509 --> 00:30:01,509
compromises you can make to achieve that

698
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:04,150
and I feel like a lot of that is just

699
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:06,039
it's smoke and mirrors like the folks

700
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:09,910
that are out there doing this you can

701
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:11,769
can probably they're gonna make it

702
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,240
really tough in the next few years I

703
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:16,720
hear people talking about that they're

704
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,370
gonna be selling below cost in the

705
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,420
future there's gonna be big groups you

706
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:22,149
guys already know all their names

707
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:25,390
they're out there and they're they're

708
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:27,280
out there to crush and we're gonna have

709
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:31,120
to have something unique and special and

710
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:36,009
highlight the people aspect of this more

711
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:37,569
than anything and the the the community

712
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:38,920
is why I'm part of this that's why I

713
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:42,879
wanted to make seeds because I want to

714
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:45,100
make the seeds for future generations

715
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,330
for for other people past when I'm dead

716
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:48,339
and gone are gonna be going and growing

717
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:50,500
these strains you know I don't feel like

718
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:51,970
if if I've released a seed and you guys

719
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,319
see on the Shelf you can do whatever you

720
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,640
want with it you can breed with it you

721
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,109
could share it with your friends I'm not

722
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,820
gonna take any offense to anybody

723
00:30:56,109 --> 00:30:59,139
working with my work because that's what

724
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:00,549
I'm doing with other people's work I

725
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,380
didn't invent cannabis I didn't create

726
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:05,230
any of this stuff I'm just making my own

727
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:07,760
crosses trying to provide to the other

728
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:15,710
people in the world and so

729
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:20,210
you know so I just try to try to stay

730
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:22,039
humble and you know keep keep doing the

731
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,660
work that makes me feel good and and

732
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,920
it's served in the community and being a

733
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,410
part of the community and feeling like

734
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,910
I'm part of a family that that makes me

735
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:33,380
wanna get up in the morning go do things

736
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:35,090
so so you know that's that's that's why

737
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:40,460
you know that's why I came all the way

738
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:43,730
out here to see oh you guys and back to

739
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,860
what I was saying before about what's

740
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:48,410
going on with the canvas laws where

741
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:49,729
nobody that I knew in the game two years

742
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:54,140
ago was even allowed to participate

743
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:56,480
anymore like so I don't know the answer

744
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,820
to that but I know that that's not what

745
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,950
I was working for when I was working for

746
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:03,529
you know the the students for sensible

747
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,269
drug policy and drug policy Alliance and

748
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:07,009
and these other big groups that that

749
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:10,940
I've definitely you know put in a lot of

750
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:13,160
volunteer hours for and you know I feel

751
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:16,070
like there's there's still a lot to be

752
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,380
desired in in California cannabis you

753
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:21,919
know we're supposed to be ground zero

754
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:24,170
for the best cannabis in the world and I

755
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,850
see the community that carried the water

756
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:28,250
for so many years through the scary

757
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:29,959
times being shut out of this thing where

758
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,880
you know other folks are jumping in that

759
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,900
that didn't have anything never they

760
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,910
never had dirt under their fingernails

761
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:40,430
and like I said I don't know the answer

762
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:42,380
but but something tells me it comes

763
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:44,660
through community and us getting

764
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,880
together and and strength in numbers and

765
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:50,750
making sure that we get active at the

766
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:53,829
local level and at the state level

767
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,828
[Applause]

768
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,549
it's gonna be hard to follow you

769
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:06,400
the where's curious is uh you're all

770
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,440
working on interesting stuff and I know

771
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,930
some of the work you're doing all three

772
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,640
you but you're always constantly

773
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:14,350
refining in switching process with

774
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,910
something excited about this year you

775
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:17,529
know whether it whether it's for the

776
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,000
market or not but like what's something

777
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,889
you're into yourself that you're working

778
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,099
with you'd like to see people access in

779
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:29,860
any form gosh so many things but I want

780
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:34,539
to say on what Jason had brought up and

781
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:38,769
what me and gene brought up Beth did you

782
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:43,379
speak this weekend Beth Schecter hi okay

783
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:46,629
so the open cannabis project looks to

784
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:50,020
protect the cultivar the strains that

785
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:52,360
we're all you know we've known and loved

786
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:55,089
for a long time and and hopefully

787
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:57,189
combinations of all of them so that we

788
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:59,980
can all keep doing the work that we've

789
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:02,670
been doing breeding and cultivating and

790
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:06,460
it's a nonprofit organization and

791
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:11,378
there's definitely gonna be some big bad

792
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:13,300
Wolf's come in to get genetics and it's

793
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:15,398
really hard that what do you do you hide

794
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,649
them away like don't give them away

795
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:20,799
you know don't come to an event like

796
00:34:17,648 --> 00:34:22,898
this and and say here have a few of this

797
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,220
and a few of that cuz you know maybe

798
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:27,219
there's somebody in the room or

799
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:32,559
something you it's almost impossible and

800
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:34,569
so we just gotta kind of support an

801
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:40,000
organization like that is really the

802
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:44,530
best way that we can keep cannabis open

803
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,949
source and keep like the genetics of

804
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:51,159
cannabis accessible to everybody because

805
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:54,939
the Syngenta's and the Monsanto's would

806
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:56,409
like to you know just tie up all these

807
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,590
strains and of course there's this

808
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:03,670
phenomena that's unusual where something

809
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:06,140
has been in under prohibition for you

810
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:09,280
know since in all of modern

811
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:12,469
times that has been basically illegal so

812
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,220
you know any innovation that has

813
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:19,819
happened has not been documented because

814
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:22,399
you know it's like at Humboldt C company

815
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,289
we keep freaking notes during the

816
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,300
breeding season and then burn them in

817
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:28,460
the fall because it was like you know

818
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,769
I'm not trying to keep notes around

819
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:35,119
about you know how many goddamn plants I

820
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:36,769
had and you know so charge enhancement

821
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,480
back in the day what's a charge

822
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:40,099
enhancement you know it's although you

823
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,719
were in the game I caught an extra

824
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:44,059
couple years on a case I had to fight

825
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:46,429
because I had spreadsheets comparing

826
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:48,110
operations and it gave me a criminal

827
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:49,369
mastermind charge and we all laughed and

828
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:53,269
I said if I was so smart at winning a

829
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:55,009
fucking court but no nonetheless the

830
00:35:53,269 --> 00:35:57,469
enhancement was really punishing because

831
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:59,360
I was using tools to document work goes

832
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:00,889
in it was impossible to keep this much

833
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,930
data when you're running this many

834
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:05,000
operations and I had my hand and a lot

835
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:08,029
of cookie jaws way back in the day yeah

836
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,840
you know and so you know those those

837
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:15,080
folks that look to capitalize so much

838
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,970
could easily come in and and try to you

839
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:21,110
know to say that they've created

840
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:23,359
something that's new when really me and

841
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:26,110
Gene's been breeding it for 20 goddamn

842
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,670
years and you know so on and so forth so

843
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:32,140
that's a good organization to support I

844
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:36,700
really appreciate what Beth's done and

845
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:39,889
you know as far as some exciting stuff

846
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:42,049
that we're doing I think you know really

847
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:49,069
that big phenotype hunt effort was

848
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:52,150
exciting for me and what else are you

849
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:55,910
gonna release the product this year

850
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:59,930
we'll be dropping the sort of selected

851
00:36:55,909 --> 00:37:03,349
cuts like Daniels farm we picked one

852
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:06,250
that we're calling magic melon and that

853
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:13,009
one just really smells like melons and

854
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:16,670
its kind of gassy fuel finish but yeah I

855
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:19,079
don't know I just I feel really just

856
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:24,369
happy to be able to

857
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:29,500
work on in cannabis and share share the

858
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:32,079
the genetics and and definitely like

859
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:35,889
what it did I got an email the other day

860
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:39,548
and I looked at the email and I thought

861
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:43,509
it was kind of weirded it said Burpee in

862
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:45,759
the email and so I replied to the email

863
00:37:43,509 --> 00:37:49,179
and did some fishing and sure enough it

864
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:51,519
was Burpee and I don't really I don't

865
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:52,989
know like are they big bad wolf or not I

866
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:54,868
mean I don't I didn't follow the

867
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:56,919
corporate ladder all the way out but

868
00:37:54,869 --> 00:38:01,990
that's the kind of stuff that's

869
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:04,150
happening so definitely be careful but

870
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:10,348
you just gotta we we got to keep

871
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:13,358
charging forward and so exciting things

872
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:18,910
just breeding more and more all the time

873
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:21,940
and and we're doing some genotyping and

874
00:38:18,909 --> 00:38:25,028
putting it in the public space so that's

875
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:29,289
a way that you can once you do that if

876
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:35,489
you don't patent it in a year then it

877
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:40,049
becomes public public domain and so

878
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:44,558
that's what I would call defensive IP

879
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:48,489
versus offensive IP which is getting a

880
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:51,339
patent and you know sending out cease

881
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:54,459
and desist letters to everybody in the

882
00:38:51,338 --> 00:38:57,788
room he doesn't pay you a fee for for

883
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,349
growing it or whatever and I think that

884
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:02,470
there's you know I'm not saying I'm

885
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:05,640
completely opposed to patents but I

886
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:12,848
think definitely that it's it's a

887
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:16,268
slippery slope and so you know there's a

888
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:18,548
lot of things out there that just are

889
00:39:16,268 --> 00:39:21,669
that should just be public domain I mean

890
00:39:18,548 --> 00:39:24,759
if I could just take a snapshot of the

891
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:27,039
whole cannabis space right now and make

892
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:28,568
sure that that could continue to be the

893
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:29,860
way it is and people could continue to

894
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:33,880
grow the plant I think

895
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:37,870
would be a good thing to do but it's

896
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:40,360
costs cost a lot of money to genotype so

897
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:42,250
you know that and and that's not the

898
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:47,680
only solution to there's other ways to

899
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:50,130
go about it but yeah so that's that's

900
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,129
exciting

901
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:57,550
I don't do min gloom you know no but the

902
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,230
thing is though it's hard they're all in

903
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:02,260
the real everyone in the room is in the

904
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,969
real yeah and and a lot of it is the

905
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,440
struggle because that's so much the

906
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:08,169
reality of what you're having to deal

907
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,079
with and what I wanted what I want to

908
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:13,510
make sure though is that the things that

909
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,519
you see and that interests you because

910
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:18,070
see you guys are you're the painters

911
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:20,829
that create the the ink that we use to

912
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:22,330
do our work and so you know you see you

913
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:23,469
broke out the melon and so the thing was

914
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:25,000
he said hey know what we found was

915
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:27,039
something that was unbelievably Melanie

916
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,389
with the beautiful fuel back and we

917
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,340
think it would be attractive and it

918
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:32,319
would be valuable for the market and and

919
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:35,050
that's that's what I'm seeking from it

920
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,450
and and the part about us all struggling

921
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,740
is as real as it can be and and I try to

922
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:40,689
make light of it because otherwise you

923
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:44,919
go i'ma cry and you know and tissue

924
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:48,159
paper is expensive so what about you big

925
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,690
gene which what you messing around what

926
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,759
directions do you go with your lines cuz

927
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,769
you you work some lines that you've had

928
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,300
for a long time but you switch the

929
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:58,210
direction on them and it's kind of neat

930
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:00,460
because it lets you swing a picture yeah

931
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:04,150
I mean what I'd really like to do is do

932
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:09,550
I'll do the I'll do those fresh hybrids

933
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:11,440
and then try to go through and seed a

934
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,840
lot of plants every time I do anything

935
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,019
so then I think you can go in all these

936
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:19,240
different directions so when you make

937
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:21,190
that that fresh hybrid you get you know

938
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:24,459
if stuff is if stuff is fairly

939
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:28,000
consistent you start with then you you

940
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,380
get a pretty you get a pretty it's

941
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,880
pretty predictable to know what you're

942
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,650
gonna get but then when you make that f2

943
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,789
you get all the weirdness and then when

944
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,769
you go when you get all the weirdness

945
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:37,239
then that's where you can really you

946
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:41,500
know make one thing into a million

947
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:42,399
things you know so with with some of

948
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,230
them

949
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,490
tried to take them different directions

950
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:49,298
and then some of them is just a real

951
00:41:45,489 --> 00:41:51,399
clear direction but like um this year

952
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:53,619
I'm really trying to work on like the

953
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:58,088
root beer stuff that's really cool

954
00:41:53,619 --> 00:42:00,400
because it's it's a trip like with doing

955
00:41:58,088 --> 00:42:01,929
seeds there's a whole lot of seeds that

956
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,230
are really interesting and they're and

957
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:07,149
they're awesome and like they all are

958
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,679
you know really valid in the space as

959
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,599
far as going okay we need to have all

960
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:12,489
these things but it's really a trip

961
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:14,710
because when you go to actually sell a

962
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:17,558
lot of weed it kind of has to look a

963
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:19,990
certain way it has to have you know

964
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:22,240
there has to be something about it where

965
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:24,608
it's like okay that's shiny that has

966
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:27,038
people really like a little color to it

967
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:29,440
asked to at least have a silver look if

968
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,599
not dark or purple or blue or red or

969
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,028
whatever you know regular green but

970
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,190
better be really tasty and really stinky

971
00:42:34,028 --> 00:42:38,380
to be able to compete you know so like

972
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:41,079
the root beer is a cool one because of

973
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,460
the the way it smokes the way it grows

974
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:45,430
all that stuff so this year I'm trying

975
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:48,278
to do like a back cross to that clone

976
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:53,259
twice and the original male I started

977
00:42:48,278 --> 00:42:55,028
with was almost the same thing so it was

978
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,710
already pretty consistent right away and

979
00:42:55,028 --> 00:43:00,010
then going back to it a couple times

980
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:02,710
made it made it really nice and then

981
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:05,170
what I'm gonna try to do with that is um

982
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,579
I'll probably go back one more time to

983
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:09,338
the root beer clone to make it so that

984
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:10,778
it's like really root beer seed cuz it

985
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:12,369
has got more and more frequent when you

986
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:14,798
back cross not everything does that if

987
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:16,420
it's too inconsistent throws too much

988
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:18,429
weird stuff you know but it comes

989
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,829
through so it dominates in the crosses

990
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,328
and and then but I think what I'm gonna

991
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:24,400
do while it's still just a little more

992
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:26,410
open at the at the at the two back

993
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,588
crosses I'm probably gonna do a bunch of

994
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:31,629
out crosses of it this year and then do

995
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:35,769
the same thing with the cherry limeade

996
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:37,028
and the reason being that when you get

997
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:38,500
like if you go to get clones from

998
00:43:37,028 --> 00:43:41,289
somebody you know how it is it's like

999
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,059
you have to everything's cool to have

1000
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:44,349
some like okay I'm gonna have some of

1001
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:46,359
this I'm gonna have some of that but

1002
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:48,760
when people like want units and weight

1003
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:50,469
of something you have to be able to have

1004
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,349
something that people look at and even

1005
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:54,549
if they don't know the name its

1006
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:56,800
recognizably what they is in there

1007
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:58,840
paradigm of what's the dank some of the

1008
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,460
best we've might look like shoelaces and

1009
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,230
be all messed up and look like dr.

1010
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:04,510
Grinspoon or something you know

1011
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:06,400
but when you when you really want

1012
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:09,010
something that you can have in your bag

1013
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,000
- people go okay you you just want that

1014
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:15,070
instant yep there it is and so those are

1015
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,179
things that do that you open the bag you

1016
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:23,320
I want that so like I'm trying to do

1017
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:25,089
that because when you you know you want

1018
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,710
to have plants that grow well for you as

1019
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:29,079
a farmer and then you need a product

1020
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:30,159
that's really gonna be that thing and

1021
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:31,900
that's the whole thing I was talking

1022
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,639
about with like with brand recognitions

1023
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:36,910
like people go oh it's hype a type of

1024
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:39,609
type it's like we'll hype hype doesn't

1025
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:41,170
last so like I remember when cookies

1026
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,150
came out it was like that's hype it's

1027
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:46,030
not good it's like well maybe it's not

1028
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:49,960
as good as it's not a strongest headband

1029
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:53,080
or cam or whatever is your thing but

1030
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,750
you're you know it's like if it was just

1031
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:57,730
hype it wouldn't be here ten years after

1032
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,800
I got it it's still here and all the

1033
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:01,449
crosses are still that and when you

1034
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,810
really get into it you go okay this is

1035
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:06,579
cool stuff and but the reason why it's

1036
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:08,619
valuable to grow it is because you know

1037
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:10,750
when you finish it you can sell it like

1038
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:12,789
if you're a tomato farmer you know most

1039
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:14,769
people are gonna wind up like okay this

1040
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:16,929
one has shelf life it's good boom we're

1041
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:18,670
gonna grow these Roma's we want to grow

1042
00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:20,710
these really cool air loom rainbow

1043
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,170
Tomatoes but when you go in the stores

1044
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:26,139
only a little bit of those go over here

1045
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:28,150
you got this whole tier of these Roma's

1046
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:30,940
over here what our beefsteak so ever so

1047
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,769
we're gonna grow those so you need

1048
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,269
things to fit in people's paradigms so

1049
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:36,460
I'm trying to put out some stuff that's

1050
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:38,289
really like people go oh it's the hype

1051
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,599
stuff oh it's just it's another gelato

1052
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:42,550
cross it's this or it's that but it's a

1053
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:44,619
trip because if you don't have something

1054
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:46,300
that people on a knee-jerk reaction will

1055
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:48,460
look at and go that's the stuff that's

1056
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,010
what everybody wants then or do you

1057
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:52,659
really want to have 350 pounds of it and

1058
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,730
you you wanna you want to have a quarter

1059
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:56,469
pound for your head or whatever to share

1060
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:59,199
and you know maybe you got somebody who

1061
00:45:56,469 --> 00:46:00,759
wants this or that but you know I'm just

1062
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,649
trying to really make sure that like the

1063
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:05,200
stuff that I'm putting out is stuff that

1064
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:06,389
when you're done with it it's what

1065
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,368
people come back

1066
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:10,108
like this last stuff I released was like

1067
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:13,170
I had that Pina the Pina a lot of times

1068
00:46:10,108 --> 00:46:15,509
a CVD plant but it's super Hardy its

1069
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:18,389
structures great it does will not get

1070
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:20,339
p.m. it's like so easy in such a great

1071
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:22,259
you know you could probably dry farm and

1072
00:46:20,338 --> 00:46:24,028
I haven't tried but I have seen my buddy

1073
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:27,119
leave the Pina Cross cherries that I

1074
00:46:24,028 --> 00:46:30,539
made in some three gallon pots basically

1075
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,400
in a in a in a in a greenhouse that

1076
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:34,589
wasn't being grown in so it was like a

1077
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,599
hundred and thirty degree desert in

1078
00:46:34,588 --> 00:46:38,489
there every day and the plants he

1079
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,170
watered him when they were starts they

1080
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:41,699
never grew but then they butted and they

1081
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:44,400
finished and there was this killer weed

1082
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:46,348
in there that we basically found going

1083
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,559
to his house and I was like well that's

1084
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:51,660
got value too you know but but it's weed

1085
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,309
that when people you know it originally

1086
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:55,710
I was like it's CBD people only want

1087
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:57,089
Kush I'd have a little bit of it people

1088
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:59,159
would show up and they'd be like no we

1089
00:46:57,088 --> 00:47:01,619
want more of those we want that one so

1090
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:03,449
that's you know something try and trying

1091
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:06,599
to put stuff out that's actually like

1092
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:08,068
can really be practical for people that

1093
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,869
are farming it's like the sky cuddler

1094
00:47:08,068 --> 00:47:10,980
Kush like that's in the conus favorite

1095
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:13,349
weed you know it's like got the

1096
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,740
knee-jerk okay this is cool I understand

1097
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:19,769
that it smells gassy but as a grower to

1098
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:21,808
its really performing you know so that's

1099
00:47:19,768 --> 00:47:26,038
just the focus of like the stuff that

1100
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:28,528
I'm working on in general is to be like

1101
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:30,390
that like I love the lime and the lime

1102
00:47:28,528 --> 00:47:32,670
is great but the lime is a little bit

1103
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:34,949
more it's a little more leafy when you

1104
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,599
grow it it's so I'm trying to work it

1105
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:38,250
into a little bit more different stuff

1106
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:40,650
so that's like cross it back with a og

1107
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:42,239
keeps the nose gets a little meat on the

1108
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,889
bones that's what the lime pop cush is

1109
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:45,479
you get the huge plants if you're

1110
00:47:43,889 --> 00:47:48,929
growing big plants so I've been working

1111
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,759
on that but then I made like I took like

1112
00:47:48,929 --> 00:47:51,629
the cherry limeade f5 and I put it on

1113
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:54,539
gelato

1114
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:56,338
herb you know things that you're like oh

1115
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:58,410
that's a stupid but it's like yeah but

1116
00:47:56,338 --> 00:48:00,929
that's what people want in their bag to

1117
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:02,608
buy so you you got to have that you know

1118
00:48:00,929 --> 00:48:04,018
what I mean so that's kind of the this

1119
00:48:02,608 --> 00:48:07,500
stuff I've been I've been trying to work

1120
00:48:04,018 --> 00:48:09,028
on more stuff that's like that and then

1121
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,929
at the same time I'm always doing my

1122
00:48:09,028 --> 00:48:15,088
regular stuff that's for me that I you

1123
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:17,548
know that I that I vibe with even more

1124
00:48:15,088 --> 00:48:19,318
but I you know you can't help but but

1125
00:48:17,548 --> 00:48:20,340
also vibe with something that you look

1126
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:23,039
at and you go whoa

1127
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:25,950
well that's incredible I mean I went to

1128
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,840
the ego clash and hopping down there and

1129
00:48:25,949 --> 00:48:30,239
I saw all the stuff and everybody I

1130
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,910
walked up and they go which one which

1131
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:34,409
one you know would you say would be good

1132
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:37,500
out of there and I missed the part where

1133
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:39,420
you smoke and all that and I just looked

1134
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:42,570
in the case and I was all that number 14

1135
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:43,920
that looks like that's that's fire right

1136
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:45,720
there I don't know what it is but it

1137
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,200
looks good it's got that good old-school

1138
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:48,779
canny

1139
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:49,919
frost it up look and then they announce

1140
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,830
the winner and they're like oh the

1141
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,650
number 14 gelato 41 or something you

1142
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:58,409
know and I was like oh all right well I

1143
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,090
mean you can't really argue with you

1144
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:02,399
can't just like just hype pocky

1145
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:04,590
strain whatever it's you can't you can't

1146
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,700
you know yeah I learned that from a guy

1147
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:08,250
that was in fashion

1148
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:10,349
and and I've not historically been known

1149
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:12,269
as someone who's been fashionable so I

1150
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:14,730
asked people who are fashionable about

1151
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:17,219
you know fashion yeah and they said you

1152
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:18,539
can't argue with trends that people do

1153
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:19,500
because what you're saying is that

1154
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,000
you're not intelligent enough to

1155
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,460
recognize that they made the choice to

1156
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,469
do it and so what happens is you cut

1157
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,519
yourself right out of the trend and I

1158
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:27,750
think that's the same with what you're

1159
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:30,750
talking about the plants at the bottom

1160
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:31,860
line is if if 41 cut wasn't hot then why

1161
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:35,099
is it moving at a rate that's

1162
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:36,690
supernatural and it doesn't mean you

1163
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:39,630
need to jump on it but you need to

1164
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:41,010
understand why the white what I learn

1165
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,480
from someone is tooth these two things

1166
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:44,370
in life those that know how and those

1167
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,070
that know why and those that know how

1168
00:49:44,369 --> 00:49:48,900
work for those that know why and for us

1169
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:50,460
it's the why that's what's important for

1170
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,099
us otherwise we end up just being how

1171
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,840
how do we make it and we understand why

1172
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:57,539
are we making it and what what is that

1173
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,250
direction and and I agree man I see all

1174
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:01,519
these modern cultivars that are red hot

1175
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:04,650
and I go I got you some of them are my

1176
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,480
personal preference but I don't deny the

1177
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:09,210
fact that it moves at an unbelievable

1178
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,340
velocity and when you do objective

1179
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:14,550
testing where I take I take things that

1180
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:15,930
I think are hot and I give them to

1181
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:18,870
people who are in markets that are

1182
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:22,079
unbelievably picky and they have money

1183
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:24,989
which means they have access and I let

1184
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,329
them run them to find out compared to

1185
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:30,029
each other which one has the velocity

1186
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:32,250
and then it lets me really understand of

1187
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:34,019
these elites which one really is the

1188
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:36,059
attraction and why and

1189
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:37,889
and also lost that lets me understand

1190
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:40,049
which ones didn't I think had the

1191
00:50:37,889 --> 00:50:42,599
attraction and I go whoa the market

1192
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:45,200
still likes that but so much of it is

1193
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:47,909
that that that visual appearance and

1194
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:49,500
you've been trained to choose those

1195
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:52,440
things because that's what we've got the

1196
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,699
last 30 years in cannabis and I always

1197
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,200
tell people some of the strong spot I

1198
00:50:53,699 --> 00:50:57,569
have a smoke that it looked like it was

1199
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,719
a piece of cabbage run over by a tractor

1200
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:02,340
and it got me so high that I had to

1201
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:03,569
drive around the island three times cuz

1202
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,820
I couldn't figure out how to get off the

1203
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:07,650
highway on the on-ramp and I was I was

1204
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,240
out in Hawaii and I got so lit that I

1205
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:10,619
couldn't really get off the freeway and

1206
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:12,809
I was laughs and I just said screw it

1207
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:14,699
I'll just drive it out and at some point

1208
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:15,960
I'll come down and I'll be able to

1209
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:20,189
figure out how do you get off the

1210
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,840
freeway you know and what I wasn't

1211
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:25,380
laughing at the moment I was like whoa I

1212
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:26,940
am scorched but if I could get my hands

1213
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,970
on that again I loved it but the thing

1214
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:31,230
was you know I challenge you to sell it

1215
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:33,719
because it looked like it was some

1216
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:35,159
cabbage run over by a tractor yeah yeah

1217
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:38,789
yeah so that's why that's why it's like

1218
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:40,679
you know like oh yeah gelato just gelato

1219
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:42,570
cross you know what I mean like yeah I

1220
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:44,219
made a gelato cross I'm a - herb cross

1221
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:47,370
like the mail I started with though is

1222
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:49,559
f5 and those generations to get to add

1223
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:52,079
to get to f3 took a while out of the

1224
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:54,179
twos to get to the four took a while out

1225
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,920
of the threes it's not like I just want

1226
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:59,339
one two three four five boom man gelato

1227
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,470
and even that is a lot of work but you

1228
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,510
know going along the way to go okay cool

1229
00:52:01,469 --> 00:52:05,099
we got rid of this we got rid of that I

1230
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:06,960
mean I think you probably grew some of

1231
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:08,130
the early cherry generations that I had

1232
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,590
that have all the weird

1233
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:12,510
herckel recessives in it that palm out

1234
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:14,430
with that still had little duck foot and

1235
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:16,830
they're teeny and they won't grow and

1236
00:52:14,429 --> 00:52:18,779
the weed is amazing incredible I already

1237
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:21,779
thinks I've got to get both and then so

1238
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,670
now like I have cherry lime F sixes and

1239
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,590
if you grow those they're all big fast

1240
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:28,230
vegging plants they all have the same

1241
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:33,210
bud structure they all have the super

1242
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:36,539
high 5% terpenes at SC 18 22 percent THC

1243
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:38,730
real consistent all the same doesn't

1244
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:41,730
mold doesn't break doesn't care if it's

1245
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:44,639
windy you know and then take that like

1246
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,960
what I use to make that and then that

1247
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:49,769
was out crossed

1248
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:51,358
to these you know height whatever and so

1249
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:52,230
then you know with that then you at

1250
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:55,199
least know you've got some

1251
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:57,088
predictability there and at the same

1252
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:59,009
time you have marketability so that you

1253
00:52:57,088 --> 00:53:02,369
you you're bringing because you've got a

1254
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:04,230
there's only so many enthusiasts and all

1255
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:06,900
of us enthusiasts can go ahead and go

1256
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:09,329
okay cool yeah this is this really rare

1257
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:12,059
weed thing you know like this is this

1258
00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:14,400
trippy like it's it's out there like um

1259
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:17,550
like Caleb right now is working with

1260
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,530
that Australian bastard cannabis and

1261
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:21,150
people are like why would you want this

1262
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:23,099
and I'm like if you really like plants

1263
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:25,470
you want that because it's not the other

1264
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:27,720
one you have but you're not gonna go

1265
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:29,639
okay I'm gonna switch over my hoops to

1266
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:31,139
this people are gonna go once it's

1267
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:32,549
trimmed in the bag it probably isn't

1268
00:53:31,139 --> 00:53:33,900
even different because the leaves are

1269
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,910
cut off and the leaves are what's cool

1270
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,380
and it has valuable things and you want

1271
00:53:35,909 --> 00:53:39,328
to have it in your arsenal I looked

1272
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,240
right out it and went if I can get a

1273
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:44,700
plant that's like a bomb-ass Afghani to

1274
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,429
grow with this size leaves you're gonna

1275
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:48,750
have yields that are gonna crush

1276
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:51,088
everything because if you can get a fat

1277
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:53,579
bud on something that veges faster than

1278
00:53:51,088 --> 00:53:55,500
that with a tiny little leaf it's just

1279
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:57,690
gonna get Sun right to the bud the whole

1280
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,670
way she can have these huge buds like

1281
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:01,260
this but instead of being on the end

1282
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,970
with these big fat leaves that block

1283
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,000
everything out you're gonna have them

1284
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:07,649
six feet long so that's where you get

1285
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,358
like the cool stuff and though those

1286
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,920
things are valuable for breeders but you

1287
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:13,380
buy a pack of seeds you're like dude I

1288
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,789
want to grow this and maybe I want to

1289
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,619
find a clone or I just want to grow

1290
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:18,088
these and just have good bud like I try

1291
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:20,160
to make sure that my seed you plant a

1292
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:22,409
row of it I have to be able to plant a

1293
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,449
row of it and have 10 or 20 of them and

1294
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:27,719
hundreds or three hundreds or whatever

1295
00:54:24,449 --> 00:54:29,789
and look at him and go okay cool I'm

1296
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:31,078
glad I grew that in my garden so that's

1297
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:33,449
what I try to do that's what I try to

1298
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:35,789
put out you know but with the new the

1299
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:38,009
new stuff too was it's I'm trying to

1300
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:40,199
like make sure it's you know always

1301
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:41,940
because the cutting edge turps and

1302
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:44,969
something that that fits into the

1303
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,769
picture pre marketed yeah yeah just do

1304
00:54:44,969 --> 00:54:48,449
it making smart business yeah and that's

1305
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:50,190
why that's why I was saying about better

1306
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:51,629
to loop back that's what was cool about

1307
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:53,909
the root beer is it almost looks like a

1308
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:55,710
cookies or it looks like it's something

1309
00:54:53,909 --> 00:54:56,769
like that but it's cuz it has black affi

1310
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:59,289
in it way back in it

1311
00:54:56,769 --> 00:55:01,150
hindu and then it has the headband the

1312
00:54:59,289 --> 00:55:04,150
la cush like Mandal had back in the day

1313
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:06,010
and so those it makes it like this ultra

1314
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:07,360
potent thing like if you're used to

1315
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:10,090
smoking cookies and you smoke this

1316
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:12,160
you're like okay this is super

1317
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:14,650
satisfying smoke you know it breaks up a

1318
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:16,299
little better and it's got you know just

1319
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:20,110
really killer so those are those are

1320
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:21,580
ones that are that are going and that's

1321
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:24,400
the that's the thing maintaining those

1322
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:27,009
cool that cool all that neat stuff and

1323
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,780
then being able to go okay here's what

1324
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:31,270
we need to be competitive because we do

1325
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:33,910
have to be super competitive and all you

1326
00:55:31,269 --> 00:55:38,019
really need is a plant that is that

1327
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:39,670
special and people will go oh okay I got

1328
00:55:38,019 --> 00:55:41,230
it like it's good it's great for

1329
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,789
everyone to share everything it's great

1330
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:46,059
for everyone to share especially these

1331
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:48,369
bulk these these bulk gene pools you

1332
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:50,019
know what I mean but like if you have

1333
00:55:48,369 --> 00:55:51,549
your own clone and everyone's like oh

1334
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:53,019
you can't get like maybe you don't want

1335
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:54,310
to give that clone away cuz maybe you

1336
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:56,469
want to have something that you're like

1337
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:57,909
no I know how to do this you might talk

1338
00:55:56,469 --> 00:56:00,429
to someone's grandma she's like sorry

1339
00:55:57,909 --> 00:56:02,829
you can't have my cookie recipe no

1340
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:05,079
because it's my wanna have this I want

1341
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:06,610
to win the I want to win the contest at

1342
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:08,650
the whatever you know what I mean or

1343
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:10,450
whatever it's for like there's a there's

1344
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:12,579
a there's something to that you know so

1345
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:15,279
like definitely everyone's got to share

1346
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:17,319
but it there's there's a huge edge to

1347
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,560
being able to go okay I have this thing

1348
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,850
and I'm the only one with it and it's

1349
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,579
something for everyone to think about

1350
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:28,360
that find that plant where you know you

1351
00:56:24,579 --> 00:56:31,299
you're you might not be able to sell sfv

1352
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:33,730
you're like I I was getting you know

1353
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:36,789
three grand for this sfv now people want

1354
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:38,079
to give me 600 everything's crashed but

1355
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:40,630
then you go to talk to somebody in

1356
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:43,119
they're like dude I have this one and no

1357
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:46,240
matter what everybody my buddies got

1358
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,579
this Vermont Diesel it's like pre sour

1359
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,139
diesel diesel look you know like I don't

1360
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:51,789
know if it really is but that's how it

1361
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:54,099
is it's like just straight like super

1362
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:56,650
skunk it smells like skunk and then

1363
00:56:54,099 --> 00:56:58,420
underneath it's just like clove and it's

1364
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:02,349
super super bomb and he just calls it

1365
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:05,920
diesel and anybody who looks at that and

1366
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:07,480
they tell you oh sorry this good indoor

1367
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,500
but I'm only gonna give you a thousand

1368
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,929
for it you're like cool

1369
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,460
where's the next guy cuz one out of

1370
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:15,460
three people who smell this shit are

1371
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:17,858
gonna say dude what do you want like if

1372
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:19,929
I have that I can sell that to people

1373
00:57:17,858 --> 00:57:21,819
for whatever I want to ask for it and

1374
00:57:19,929 --> 00:57:23,769
it's just because people don't all have

1375
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:26,349
it if everyone has it people see a bad

1376
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:29,440
version of it now all of a sudden it's

1377
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:31,450
whatever it is it's cool its cush but

1378
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,490
there's definitely like a value and that

1379
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:36,969
of looking for your own thing having it

1380
00:57:33,489 --> 00:57:39,848
and you know being able to being able to

1381
00:57:36,969 --> 00:57:42,250
run with something that's you know got a

1382
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:43,840
little edge on it but so that that's

1383
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:50,800
what I'm always doing trying to make

1384
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:52,900
stuff like that I took all right G

1385
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,690
that's absolutely right and you know

1386
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:59,500
like when I look around this room I

1387
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:02,170
think what the reality is is that so

1388
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:05,139
many of us like if you think of it's a

1389
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:07,900
race or whatever a racetrack so many of

1390
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:11,108
us are actually like lapping the whole

1391
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:13,869
industry that it's easy to look like

1392
00:58:11,108 --> 00:58:16,838
you're behind but we're really all just

1393
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:18,460
like so far ahead and say what gene was

1394
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:21,670
saying is like sometimes you gotta you

1395
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:23,800
know give them what they want and so you

1396
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:25,809
know you do a few draught of crosses or

1397
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,200
make sure everything is you know a

1398
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:31,750
certain THC level for for the year but

1399
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:34,929
never ever give up on those cultivars

1400
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:38,530
that like that mean everything to you I

1401
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:40,029
mean I can't like back god eight nine

1402
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:43,150
years ago people would give me such a

1403
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:46,269
hard time really why do you have seeds

1404
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:48,400
that make purple cannabis everybody

1405
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:51,369
hates purple they were like oh it's it's

1406
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,289
because it's deficient your your weeds

1407
00:58:51,369 --> 00:58:55,838
purple because it's deficient in

1408
00:58:53,289 --> 00:58:59,079
whatever something they tell me and I'd

1409
00:58:55,838 --> 00:59:01,539
be like no it's it's not and this is

1410
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:04,529
like so the trends and I guess the whole

1411
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:07,179
lapping thing like we're always like a

1412
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:09,099
one-lap ahead and sometimes it can look

1413
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:11,079
like we're kind of behind the pack but

1414
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:14,200
really we're just like ahead of it and

1415
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:16,440
nobody knows it yet so I think does for

1416
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:16,439
gene

1417
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:26,449
so ya know same thing you got you got a

1418
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:27,950
lot of killer stuff you you you work

1419
00:59:26,449 --> 00:59:30,769
some interesting directions since I've

1420
00:59:27,949 --> 00:59:32,058
met you and I like that you know you've

1421
00:59:30,769 --> 00:59:33,798
been you've been really putting together

1422
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:36,260
some interesting combinations and the

1423
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:39,259
number of people that bring me material

1424
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:40,549
that you've done I got something my job

1425
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,440
right now someone said man I doesn't

1426
00:59:40,548 --> 00:59:45,469
kill equilibrium working I said all nice

1427
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:47,059
what is it and I laughed because each

1428
00:59:45,469 --> 00:59:48,889
one of those samples was radically

1429
00:59:47,059 --> 00:59:52,460
different than the other because the

1430
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:54,588
lines were different and I I like that

1431
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,480
when I see people have separation and

1432
00:59:54,588 --> 00:59:58,670
what they're doing and and your desires

1433
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,838
to go these different trends and so

1434
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,039
you've been you've up with some cool

1435
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:04,279
stuff what we've been what are you doing

1436
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:06,619
going on I'm I think this young and shy

1437
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,210
dig deeper into I've got so many seeds

1438
01:00:06,619 --> 01:00:11,119
and so many things I've collected over

1439
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:12,470
the years and I kind of want to I like

1440
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,809
that branching out in a whole new

1441
01:00:12,469 --> 01:00:16,548
direction just like kind of outside way

1442
01:00:14,809 --> 01:00:18,019
somewhere where maybe it's something

1443
01:00:16,548 --> 01:00:19,788
that's been sitting on the Shelf that

1444
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:21,679
I've been meaning to get to forever and

1445
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:23,359
I haven't decided anything I'm gonna

1446
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:25,338
work with yet this year but there's

1447
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:27,380
there's a few contenders the Malawi

1448
01:00:25,338 --> 01:00:29,538
lines did really well you know over the

1449
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:30,920
years there's been a lot of people

1450
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:32,089
coming back saying the African Orange

1451
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,220
was something that was really mold

1452
01:00:32,088 --> 01:00:35,750
resistant for them and and I've seen

1453
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:37,009
some of the flowers of somebody you know

1454
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:39,199
brought me some of the flowers today

1455
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,880
from Humboldt that was that was just

1456
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:43,368
probably one of the most citrusy

1457
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:48,200
versions African Orange I've ever seen

1458
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:49,940
and that's certainly a direction I want

1459
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:51,588
to go in as things that do well on the

1460
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,539
coast because I've been in you know I

1461
01:00:51,588 --> 01:00:56,239
was in Santa Cruz for so many years and

1462
01:00:53,539 --> 01:00:59,270
it's it's hard to grow almost anything

1463
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:02,389
in a lot of the areas around that County

1464
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:04,338
that's actually where I first saw some

1465
01:01:02,389 --> 01:01:06,528
mean genes work as I had a friend out

1466
01:01:04,338 --> 01:01:09,769
there that we kind of shared a little

1467
01:01:06,528 --> 01:01:11,750
patch one year and he I guess I guess he

1468
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:14,869
he had gotten some seeds from you and he

1469
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:17,239
grew the root beer and we grew the the

1470
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:20,568
PK and there was some of your cherry

1471
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:21,828
limes and it was like Oh lime I forget

1472
01:01:20,568 --> 01:01:24,019
some other and they were just beautiful

1473
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:26,329
just the Oracle lime was insane

1474
01:01:24,019 --> 01:01:27,369
especially in light of what you were

1475
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:29,289
talking about with the

1476
01:01:27,369 --> 01:01:31,990
bag appeal just like there were just

1477
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:34,329
these bulbous buds that just just looked

1478
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:36,578
amazing and probably the probably the

1479
01:01:34,329 --> 01:01:38,109
cherry lime at everything was was the

1480
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:41,019
favorite at the end of the year just

1481
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:43,239
just getting to smoke it and you know

1482
01:01:41,018 --> 01:01:45,159
the root beers were a little later but

1483
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:47,649
they just when they when they filled in

1484
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:51,639
they were like just so Turkey and and

1485
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:53,980
and enjoyable and and last year your

1486
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:56,288
Humboldt dream was my buddy's biggest

1487
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:57,909
plants in the garden last year he's got

1488
01:01:56,289 --> 01:02:00,119
a picture of him just in the Anderson

1489
01:01:57,909 --> 01:02:02,828
Valley with this plant that's just like

1490
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:04,869
gigantic you know so he's like oh I'm

1491
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:07,269
doing this one every year now so you

1492
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:10,869
guys kudos to you guys for you know

1493
01:02:07,268 --> 01:02:11,979
putting out the quality work and I think

1494
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:13,240
yeah this year you know I'm gonna

1495
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,759
probably pull out some of the other

1496
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:18,219
Malawi hybrids maybe I've seen a lot a

1497
01:02:15,759 --> 01:02:21,009
lot of buzz around the chocolate Malawi

1498
01:02:18,219 --> 01:02:22,838
which is one that I haven't been working

1499
01:02:21,009 --> 01:02:24,789
with as much in the past and so maybe

1500
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:26,858
pull that one out I think that's

1501
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:28,569
probably one at the top of the list it's

1502
01:02:26,858 --> 01:02:29,018
the chocolate hash berry to the heirloom

1503
01:02:28,568 --> 01:02:34,358
malawi

1504
01:02:29,018 --> 01:02:35,949
and you know the the glue line is one

1505
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:40,179
I've been working for a little while is

1506
01:02:35,949 --> 01:02:42,338
trying to find a reliable glue back

1507
01:02:40,179 --> 01:02:44,710
cross and find a male out of that that I

1508
01:02:42,338 --> 01:02:48,038
can hit two things and get that you know

1509
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:53,440
chocolatey gassy roma and taste out of

1510
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:55,720
the hybrids that come through and you

1511
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,880
know maybe we're gonna pull off some

1512
01:02:55,719 --> 01:03:00,159
some crazy land races and should I work

1513
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:02,440
with some you know some wild some wild

1514
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:05,528
stuff and you know try to try to see

1515
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:08,829
what you know what else we could put out

1516
01:03:05,528 --> 01:03:10,960
there that that is gonna be unique this

1517
01:03:08,829 --> 01:03:12,910
it's all about setting yourself apart in

1518
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,880
this industry and yeah like you're

1519
01:03:12,909 --> 01:03:17,259
saying maybe you find a cut that you

1520
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,849
don't want to share with people and I

1521
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:20,380
would love to hear that somebody found

1522
01:03:18,849 --> 01:03:22,298
something out of my work that that

1523
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,798
really worked well for them and they

1524
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:26,710
wanted to keep around for years and

1525
01:03:23,798 --> 01:03:31,590
years and and and maybe it helped keep

1526
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:33,358
them afloat in in tough times and so so

1527
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:37,260
certainly we're gonna keep working for

1528
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:39,630
mold resistance which is you know even

1529
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:44,040
more of an issue nowadays with you know

1530
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:47,849
the testing requirements and you know

1531
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:52,019
some of the other projects you know

1532
01:03:47,849 --> 01:03:54,090
might might include you know maybe maybe

1533
01:03:52,019 --> 01:03:58,108
some of the other Malawi's or you know

1534
01:03:54,090 --> 01:04:00,090
I've kind of got a rough sketch but but

1535
01:03:58,108 --> 01:04:02,848
we haven't we haven't nailed anything

1536
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:04,230
down yet you know I think get back with

1537
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:08,190
the team and see what everybody else

1538
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:10,710
wants to do too and you know maybe go

1539
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:12,750
back and look at because I try to I try

1540
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:14,730
catalog everything all the all the seeds

1541
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:17,280
you know everybody that gave me C's

1542
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:19,889
today we traded I'm gonna go and try to

1543
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:23,550
catalog and keep keep a list of

1544
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:26,069
everything and you know you do that long

1545
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:27,780
enough and you're gonna have a nice nice

1546
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:31,769
collection you know I hope I hope

1547
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:35,010
everybody starts getting into more of

1548
01:04:31,769 --> 01:04:38,099
their own like Fino hunts and and

1549
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:40,710
finding things that do well in your

1550
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:42,440
local situation which you know whatever

1551
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:44,670
property that you might have might be

1552
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:46,079
even totally different from your

1553
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:48,180
neighbors parcel because they're on the

1554
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,880
other side of the ridge you know or or

1555
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:53,009
maybe maybe the people down the road or

1556
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,650
you know a little closer to a valley and

1557
01:04:53,010 --> 01:05:00,150
they get more wind or you know so so

1558
01:04:55,650 --> 01:05:04,740
it's a it's great to be here and see you

1559
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:06,119
know all the different success stories

1560
01:05:04,739 --> 01:05:08,399
from different strains because that

1561
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:11,070
definitely has a big effect on my

1562
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,750
personal you know decisions of what I'm

1563
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:14,640
gonna go and breed with is when I go and

1564
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:16,588
talk to the community or I go to you

1565
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:19,500
know the Emerald cup or you know you

1566
01:05:16,588 --> 01:05:21,420
know see somebody out you know you know

1567
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,338
in town or something and they be so oh

1568
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:25,588
well you know you're you're you know

1569
01:05:23,338 --> 01:05:28,170
sour orange or you know your your

1570
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:29,849
Grandaddy orange or you know maybe one

1571
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:31,889
of these you know dream queen blue or

1572
01:05:29,849 --> 01:05:34,440
this or that like did really well for me

1573
01:05:31,889 --> 01:05:36,858
and that's I love I love hearing

1574
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,480
everybody's stories of what they've done

1575
01:05:36,858 --> 01:05:42,179
with my genetics and what they really

1576
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:44,170
liked just like you know I've got folks

1577
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:46,538
that rave about these two guys

1578
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:49,869
genetics that that they've tried in

1579
01:05:46,539 --> 01:05:54,609
previous years so you know just yeah

1580
01:05:49,869 --> 01:05:58,239
keep the stories coming so awesome and

1581
01:05:54,608 --> 01:06:01,268
you know what I like is that uh it's

1582
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:03,219
rare that most most people in nowadays

1583
01:06:01,268 --> 01:06:05,798
what I learned the internet is where you

1584
01:06:03,219 --> 01:06:07,028
talk shit so you can get recognition cuz

1585
01:06:05,798 --> 01:06:08,798
otherwise you don't exist

1586
01:06:07,028 --> 01:06:10,449
and unless you're flapping your mouth

1587
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,239
throwing rocks at someone else you're

1588
01:06:10,449 --> 01:06:14,318
not even a real person and we're sitting

1589
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:16,329
there hanging out and you're talking

1590
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:18,369
about your experiences with genes work

1591
01:06:16,329 --> 01:06:21,369
back in the day and and that's work with

1592
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:26,500
your boys stuff and you know it's just

1593
01:06:21,369 --> 01:06:30,599
it's just cool appreciate it thank you

1594
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:33,009
[Applause]

1595
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:34,930
all right I know you guys got questions

1596
01:06:33,009 --> 01:06:36,608
and so we've got some basic info that I

1597
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:39,328
want to talk about out if they want to

1598
01:06:36,608 --> 01:06:41,170
cover some stuff themselves if they have

1599
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:43,390
something they want to throw they

1600
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:44,588
welcome but otherwise man let's get the

1601
01:06:43,389 --> 01:06:46,058
audience to ask some questions because

1602
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:50,068
it's rare it's rare you get these guys

1603
01:06:46,059 --> 01:06:50,069
on the table at the same time so

1604
01:06:54,699 --> 01:06:58,989
did you hear he said he said what traits

1605
01:06:57,250 --> 01:07:02,159
do you look for us specifically in male

1606
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:08,909
plants if you're seeking a good breeder

1607
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:13,960
well I'm a big fan of the stem rub and I

1608
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:16,929
really love terpenes and the all the

1609
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:22,599
different possibilities that there are

1610
01:07:16,929 --> 01:07:26,889
in the cannabis species so that's

1611
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:31,029
something that has done me served me

1612
01:07:26,889 --> 01:07:35,949
well for ever and I'll probably never

1613
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:39,580
put down that tool you know no matter

1614
01:07:35,949 --> 01:07:44,319
what and then you know we did some some

1615
01:07:39,579 --> 01:07:48,279
testing of males this year that's kind

1616
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:50,200
of a cool trick but yeah

1617
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:52,450
and then I you know certainly structure

1618
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:54,909
and if you're trying to breed for

1619
01:07:52,449 --> 01:07:57,189
homozygosity your uniformity then you

1620
01:07:54,909 --> 01:08:00,639
want to look for one that has a similar

1621
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:02,230
structure to you know if you're trying

1622
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,599
to make an inbred line for example or

1623
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:08,800
something like that so gene you want to

1624
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:11,380
do some of that yeah that's actually

1625
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,800
just touching the plant and and and

1626
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:17,890
seeing really what the smells you get

1627
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:22,750
from the stem different ones are

1628
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:24,579
different so like og and everybody's

1629
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:26,649
nose works different but like me I can

1630
01:08:24,579 --> 01:08:29,229
pick an OG male hella easy cuz it smells

1631
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:32,439
like dill pickles to me and if it smells

1632
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:34,059
like dill pickles that one has it and it

1633
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:35,859
doesn't mean that it'll necessarily

1634
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:38,710
carry it depending on what you're

1635
01:08:35,859 --> 01:08:41,619
pulling it from so if you already have

1636
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:44,260
seeds where you know that all the

1637
01:08:41,619 --> 01:08:46,809
females do smell like OG and then you've

1638
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:48,550
get a male out of there that you know

1639
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:51,039
like if I was gonna be breeding

1640
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:53,320
something with OG for example I'd be

1641
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:55,060
like okay what does it need improvement

1642
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:56,829
on so you want a little bit of an

1643
01:08:55,060 --> 01:09:00,100
improved structure so it's a little more

1644
01:08:56,829 --> 01:09:03,010
sturdy you want improved resistance to

1645
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:04,219
powdery mildew so if I was breeding oh

1646
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:06,469
geez I'd probably

1647
01:09:04,219 --> 01:09:08,059
like stick them in a room and get them

1648
01:09:06,469 --> 01:09:09,769
really humid for a little while maybe

1649
01:09:08,059 --> 01:09:11,869
let them droop a couple times before

1650
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:13,639
they're really flower and heavy so that

1651
01:09:11,868 --> 01:09:16,278
I can kind of trigger their stress

1652
01:09:13,639 --> 01:09:18,349
response so that they'll get attacked on

1653
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:19,909
purpose so you can kind of go okay

1654
01:09:18,349 --> 01:09:21,949
there's the one that that that's

1655
01:09:19,908 --> 01:09:24,738
resistant because otherwise if you treat

1656
01:09:21,948 --> 01:09:27,469
to treat them you know if they have

1657
01:09:24,738 --> 01:09:29,568
perfect conditions and you're breeding

1658
01:09:27,469 --> 01:09:32,389
for something that's triggered by bad

1659
01:09:29,569 --> 01:09:35,269
conditions you're not gonna see it so it

1660
01:09:32,389 --> 01:09:36,769
doesn't you there's no way to select for

1661
01:09:35,269 --> 01:09:39,440
that so you have to kind of put

1662
01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:40,609
pressures on things to see different

1663
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:42,048
things like if you want to know if a

1664
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:43,670
brand if the branches are strong you're

1665
01:09:42,048 --> 01:09:46,099
gonna have to snap them you'd have to be

1666
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:49,009
like alright weak weak branches you

1667
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:52,639
break some you know and then like some

1668
01:09:49,009 --> 01:09:54,229
some plants grow with like actually

1669
01:09:52,639 --> 01:09:58,819
almost sometimes it'll almost look like

1670
01:09:54,229 --> 01:10:01,519
a bubble at the at the junction of the

1671
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:03,439
branch and the main stalk so it'll

1672
01:10:01,519 --> 01:10:06,019
actually be like there's these ones

1673
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:08,988
where they'll never break right at the

1674
01:10:06,019 --> 01:10:11,179
junction they'll actually Bend and kind

1675
01:10:08,988 --> 01:10:13,038
of break over right up from it a little

1676
01:10:11,179 --> 01:10:16,130
bit and those ones tend to be a lot more

1677
01:10:13,038 --> 01:10:18,259
sturdy and they I found those in in most

1678
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:20,409
stuff so it's like you know little

1679
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:24,050
things like that are cool to look for

1680
01:10:20,408 --> 01:10:29,238
but you know yeah the stem rub is

1681
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:31,099
basically if you I really like to if I

1682
01:10:29,238 --> 01:10:33,498
can grow something if I have enough

1683
01:10:31,099 --> 01:10:35,538
seeds if I don't have enough I'll grow

1684
01:10:33,498 --> 01:10:36,828
them and I'll just use all the males and

1685
01:10:35,538 --> 01:10:38,268
all the females and do an open

1686
01:10:36,828 --> 01:10:40,069
pollination so I know I have a bunch

1687
01:10:38,269 --> 01:10:42,710
more and then out of my favorite females

1688
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:44,328
then I'll try some of those and when I

1689
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:47,090
do the FIR when I grow them out the

1690
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:49,130
first time I'll try to figure out which

1691
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:52,400
plants you have to observe a lot so you

1692
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:55,819
look okay these plants I can notice

1693
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:59,779
these things about them and then when

1694
01:10:55,819 --> 01:11:03,288
they finish as female plants then you

1695
01:10:59,779 --> 01:11:06,828
kind of see trends so you go okay well

1696
01:11:03,288 --> 01:11:09,559
the every female that looked like this

1697
01:11:06,828 --> 01:11:12,170
or that had this stem rub they wound up

1698
01:11:09,559 --> 01:11:14,239
being like this and then you can get a

1699
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:17,090
correlation there and then you know okay

1700
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:17,449
so like if you're if you're looking for

1701
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:19,550
a good

1702
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:22,039
Gmail and ego this one smells like OG

1703
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:24,110
it's like it turns out no they're really

1704
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:26,239
good og clones to me that I have they

1705
01:11:24,109 --> 01:11:27,589
smell like pickles so I want the mail

1706
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,090
that smells like pickles if it smells

1707
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:31,340
like og when it's done it might not

1708
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:33,199
smell like og already smells like og on

1709
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:36,110
the stem so that it's it's kind of like

1710
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:37,939
learning the plants and I like to learn

1711
01:11:36,109 --> 01:11:40,069
them before I try to really do any

1712
01:11:37,939 --> 01:11:41,899
selective breeding and that makes it

1713
01:11:40,069 --> 01:11:43,429
easier and that's the thing about

1714
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:45,829
looking for male traits is there's

1715
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:47,869
overall ones you don't want one that's a

1716
01:11:45,829 --> 01:11:50,180
pest magnet you don't want one that's a

1717
01:11:47,869 --> 01:11:53,510
fungus magnet you don't want one that

1718
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:55,250
has really weak snappy structure you

1719
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:57,230
know if maybe if they're super hard to

1720
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:59,720
clone or they have really weak roots

1721
01:11:57,229 --> 01:12:02,479
there's some basic things that you can

1722
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:05,240
look for just overall and go it's not

1723
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:07,039
the best plant for these reasons but a

1724
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:08,449
lot of times with selecting males you

1725
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:10,220
actually want to find the one that

1726
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:13,279
carries what you like about the females

1727
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:16,520
so that takes observation and figuring

1728
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:19,909
out where it is and different different

1729
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:23,330
genes basically travel in groups in

1730
01:12:19,909 --> 01:12:25,250
breeding to where you might try to get

1731
01:12:23,329 --> 01:12:26,930
rid of something and discover that every

1732
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:29,060
time you get rid of that you get rid of

1733
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:31,850
the other thing you wanted so maybe you

1734
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:33,620
go oh I always want maybe somebody's

1735
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:34,970
already May as I've already bred

1736
01:12:33,619 --> 01:12:38,000
something that you're starting with

1737
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:40,520
where you go mmm the one that I like to

1738
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,590
smoke I can grow as many as I want and

1739
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:44,690
that one's I really like they always

1740
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:46,430
have kind of flimsy branches so you

1741
01:12:44,689 --> 01:12:48,460
might be stuck with that unless you want

1742
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:51,140
to make a new hybrid and then

1743
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:53,510
incorporate strength and in your new

1744
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:56,180
hybrid you can get new stuff happening

1745
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:58,300
you know but it's really for for male

1746
01:12:56,180 --> 01:13:00,980
selecting to me is really looking

1747
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:03,680
finding which male is the one that

1748
01:13:00,979 --> 01:13:06,769
really does what I want in that type and

1749
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:09,650
then using those kind of males so it

1750
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:13,670
really takes like studying the way that

1751
01:13:09,649 --> 01:13:15,259
is and then you can pick them and then

1752
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:16,609
of course use your you know use your

1753
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:19,039
general things where you go okay

1754
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:21,319
anything crappy we don't want to use

1755
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:22,850
that but have the ones that we like you

1756
01:13:21,319 --> 01:13:24,920
know you then you want to figure out

1757
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:26,600
what's like the actual it's almost like

1758
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:28,579
seeing a face and recognize in the face

1759
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,710
or recognizing a voice you're

1760
01:13:28,579 --> 01:13:32,390
there's that plant I know that plant it

1761
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:34,640
always does this you want to find those

1762
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:37,160
correlations and those groups of traits

1763
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,510
that all travel together like I someone

1764
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:41,229
was asking me about the piñas that I

1765
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:44,449
sold this year their purple stem and

1766
01:13:41,229 --> 01:13:46,399
they're all purple stem and they all

1767
01:13:44,449 --> 01:13:49,099
have the same smell and the trip was

1768
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:52,250
that the purple stem travels with this

1769
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:54,470
particular group of terpenes so that

1770
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:56,090
it's really easy to breed it to have the

1771
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:58,100
smell if you just look for the ones with

1772
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:59,690
a purple stems and then you smell the

1773
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,880
stalk there might be a couple of them

1774
01:13:59,689 --> 01:14:03,919
that are a little off you go no but this

1775
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,569
one has the most of that smell and it's

1776
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,840
purple stem you put them together and

1777
01:14:05,569 --> 01:14:13,069
really fast I was able to go okay this

1778
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:15,230
is that so if that wasn't that those

1779
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:17,090
that male might have been the sturdiest

1780
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:19,009
and the stinkiest and the fastest

1781
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:21,319
growing but if you hate that smell don't

1782
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:22,610
pick the purple stem one you got to get

1783
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:25,399
a different one so you got to learn the

1784
01:14:22,609 --> 01:14:29,719
plants and then when you select your

1785
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:33,019
males then you can you can have you know

1786
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:36,230
success a lot easier you can also just

1787
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:39,890
go I really like this plant and use that

1788
01:14:36,229 --> 01:14:41,389
male because you're likely to get plants

1789
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,920
that look like it that might have been

1790
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:46,100
what you like you're like wow this thing

1791
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:47,420
has a luster and a vigor to it and it's

1792
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:49,190
like well you're at least gonna get that

1793
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:50,779
and then you can find out later if you

1794
01:14:49,189 --> 01:14:52,609
get those other traits that are

1795
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:54,529
important to you too you can always try

1796
01:14:52,609 --> 01:14:57,409
it you always throw it and see if it

1797
01:14:54,529 --> 01:14:59,840
sticks but you wanna you wanna ideally

1798
01:14:57,409 --> 01:15:01,909
learn what you're working with first and

1799
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,340
then like I was talking about the the

1800
01:15:01,909 --> 01:15:07,279
weird the weirdos in the cherry limeade

1801
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:09,560
like if you didn't mind having really

1802
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:11,239
little weird plants you might be able to

1803
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:13,160
make really cool stuff with that cuz the

1804
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:14,689
weeds always kill her the plants not

1805
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:15,529
that good though so what I did is I

1806
01:15:14,689 --> 01:15:18,229
looked and looked

1807
01:15:15,529 --> 01:15:21,259
till I got males that had the same smell

1808
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:23,089
and the same resinous leaves and

1809
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:25,940
everything and then I went okay so this

1810
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:28,400
is like that it's more rare in this form

1811
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:30,289
but this has the traits I like in that

1812
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,989
but this thing grows and it doesn't have

1813
01:15:30,289 --> 01:15:35,869
weird a weird look to it that freaks

1814
01:15:32,989 --> 01:15:37,579
people out so then you know you wind up

1815
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:39,619
going with that but that's how I select

1816
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:41,420
males personally is by learning what it

1817
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:42,619
is like you're like okay what if you

1818
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:44,420
were breeding dogs

1819
01:15:42,619 --> 01:15:46,670
no you'd be like okay you're not gonna

1820
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:48,440
breed Rottweilers and go I liked this

1821
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:50,659
one it didn't have Rottweiler markings

1822
01:15:48,439 --> 01:15:51,769
but it's good Rottweiler and then after

1823
01:15:50,659 --> 01:15:53,449
a while people be like this ain't a

1824
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:55,340
Rottweiler dude you didn't pick the

1825
01:15:53,449 --> 01:15:57,500
right one that was a sport it was

1826
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:59,270
different and it wasn't the right thing

1827
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:00,979
to use so you want to learn you want to

1828
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:02,480
know what a Rottweiler looks like you

1829
01:16:00,979 --> 01:16:03,799
want to know how tall is the shoulder

1830
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:06,199
how tall is the hips

1831
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:09,079
what's the sway in the back how long is

1832
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:11,210
the tail on a puppy how do the ears lay

1833
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:13,760
what are their where do their teeth sit

1834
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:15,829
howard what what are the what's the line

1835
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,110
in the front all that stuff to learn to

1836
01:16:15,829 --> 01:16:19,579
go okay now I'm breeding dogs so if you

1837
01:16:18,109 --> 01:16:21,079
really want to breed stuff you really

1838
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:22,970
have to know the description of what

1839
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:25,880
you're shooting for and that's how you

1840
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:27,650
pick the males but that's not to say you

1841
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:30,470
might you might have had a killer dog

1842
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:32,809
that was like a Rottweiler that was all

1843
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:34,520
black or all tan and you're like I like

1844
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:36,080
that one nothing wrong with that you're

1845
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:38,420
just gonna be going a new place and you

1846
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:40,579
have to have focus for doing that so you

1847
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:43,609
can just randomly select a male because

1848
01:16:40,579 --> 01:16:46,340
you like it but it's gonna be more

1849
01:16:43,609 --> 01:16:48,649
difficult to lock down the exact things

1850
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:52,270
you want so you want to learn your

1851
01:16:48,649 --> 01:16:52,269
genetics to the typical Mew know

1852
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:16,570
what can we as the community do on a

1853
01:17:14,409 --> 01:17:20,590
political level to protect the people

1854
01:17:16,569 --> 01:17:22,840
who do the breeding you know when Beth

1855
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:24,699
was up yesterday it was one of the

1856
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:26,650
better presentations I've seen in a

1857
01:17:24,699 --> 01:17:30,609
minute because it gave you a protection

1858
01:17:26,649 --> 01:17:34,420
tool box and I think that and I know

1859
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:37,210
Jerry whiting and Jerry's a savvy smart

1860
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:39,039
guy from the tech era and I think he has

1861
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:40,989
the like the largest collection of Black

1862
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:43,659
Panther memorabilia because that's what

1863
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:45,670
his family was so he has this he has

1864
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:47,500
this concepts of protecting things and

1865
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:48,880
preserving culture in a different way

1866
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:51,960
than most people do and because he was

1867
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:53,770
successful in tech it also gave him a

1868
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:56,170
different view of how these things

1869
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:58,110
operate and I think that the stuff that

1870
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:59,980
we took a look at yesterday was the

1871
01:17:58,109 --> 01:18:02,319
abilities to be able to get yourself

1872
01:17:59,979 --> 01:18:04,029
contractual protection and I think with

1873
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:05,609
community protection and support is

1874
01:18:04,029 --> 01:18:08,050
really just try not to screw each other

1875
01:18:05,609 --> 01:18:09,519
you know fundamentally man choose not to

1876
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:12,310
burn the guy you're doing business with

1877
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:16,270
and that seemed to work for a long time

1878
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:17,500
I mean to me it's pretty simple and I

1879
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:19,840
think that that you know in my

1880
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:22,960
perspective from someone who traffics

1881
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,760
genetics what I want to be able to see

1882
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,560
is and what I've always done is I've

1883
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:30,510
always given credit to the people whose

1884
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:33,310
cultivars I use or material I use or

1885
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:35,230
information I use because what happens

1886
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:37,780
then is you promote just like Jason was

1887
01:18:35,229 --> 01:18:39,250
promoting NAT and gene saying hey man I

1888
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:41,439
ran his stuff that was killed and my

1889
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:43,539
friends run his stuff that's a courtesy

1890
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:44,919
he didn't have to say it but he wanted

1891
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:46,810
to say hey you know you guys are some

1892
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:49,690
some guys that I respect and I

1893
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:51,490
appreciate and what it does is it adds a

1894
01:18:49,689 --> 01:18:52,989
level of legitimacy that you can't add

1895
01:18:51,489 --> 01:18:54,760
yourself I had this discussion with

1896
01:18:52,989 --> 01:18:56,859
someone today about the internet saying

1897
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:59,079
the Internet guys tell you this is how

1898
01:18:56,859 --> 01:19:01,899
you promote yourself and I'm like no

1899
01:18:59,079 --> 01:19:04,239
really give a shit about them it's it's

1900
01:19:01,899 --> 01:19:05,969
just banter it's crap coming out them

1901
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:08,229
off perpetually and you just turn it off

1902
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:10,150
what you want is you want other people

1903
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:12,039
to validate what you're doing in an

1904
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:13,449
honest way because that resonates in a

1905
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:14,649
way that you know is true because

1906
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:17,380
they're not getting paid for it they're

1907
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:18,460
not a shill and I think that that's part

1908
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:20,739
of it is that you know you recognize

1909
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:22,869
other people's farms and you commend the

1910
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:24,369
product when it's legitimate and if you

1911
01:19:22,869 --> 01:19:25,840
don't have an ability to move your

1912
01:19:24,369 --> 01:19:27,460
product but you know someone who could

1913
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,750
move product you push that product and

1914
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:31,600
you make sure that person gets credit

1915
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:33,699
and with the breeders you know don't

1916
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,800
pirate their work of you know what would

1917
01:19:33,699 --> 01:19:38,199
you had so funny one cuz jeans a mean

1918
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,850
King but he was talking about how they

1919
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:41,079
would rename in these varietals so they

1920
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:42,340
could just get rid of the breeder and

1921
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:44,019
there was this whole meme about how the

1922
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:45,670
breeder was diminished minimized and

1923
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:48,730
wiped out so that we can name anything

1924
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:50,579
we wanted but it's it's such a true

1925
01:19:48,729 --> 01:19:52,989
statement because you're so you're so

1926
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:55,059
desirous of your own success that you

1927
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:56,439
forgot how you got there and I think

1928
01:19:55,060 --> 01:20:00,010
when it comes to with the breeders that

1929
01:19:56,439 --> 01:20:03,129
if you can keep them alive in the

1930
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:04,810
conversation all the time you know in a

1931
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:07,000
courteous sense where this is the

1932
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:09,160
material I got from Jason this is what I

1933
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,510
used if you want to buy more you can go

1934
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:12,639
to them if you've got questions you can

1935
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:14,890
go to them you become in this incredible

1936
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:16,660
referral network and I think that the

1937
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:20,289
thing that protects you from shit in

1938
01:20:16,659 --> 01:20:22,289
life most is money your own money makes

1939
01:20:20,289 --> 01:20:24,970
you pretty safe because you can afford

1940
01:20:22,289 --> 01:20:26,829
infrastructure tools connections and

1941
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:29,500
that's really what we've been deprived

1942
01:20:26,829 --> 01:20:31,479
of right now is liquidity and so we have

1943
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:33,579
to kind of pull up our skills until we

1944
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:36,129
can rebuild our liquidity but hopefully

1945
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:38,140
this bout of poverty teaches us how to

1946
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:40,390
behave a little more intelligently in a

1947
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:43,329
communal form so that when we do rear

1948
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:45,280
eyes up again as a craft culture you're

1949
01:20:43,329 --> 01:20:46,659
able to actually take the education that

1950
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:49,090
we just got about how you better stick

1951
01:20:46,659 --> 01:20:51,250
together you're gonna die and then use

1952
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:52,840
it to create the models of protection so

1953
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:54,579
that you end up having individuals that

1954
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:56,710
can do the work so that all you have to

1955
01:20:54,579 --> 01:20:58,869
do is do your work and a lot of people

1956
01:20:56,710 --> 01:21:00,039
would rather just grow and farm than

1957
01:20:58,869 --> 01:21:02,859
have to spend all their free time

1958
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:05,050
breeding - so I mean that's my opinion

1959
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:07,329
on it it's it's you you you you gotta

1960
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:09,699
you got to be honest with whose work

1961
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:14,050
you're pirating and make sure you kick

1962
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:19,210
back credit yeah I'd agree with with

1963
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:21,250
that Kevin I'm sure you guys have had it

1964
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:23,230
happen I've had it happen where where

1965
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:25,119
groups get ahold you work and they

1966
01:21:23,229 --> 01:21:29,439
rename it as their own and they don't

1967
01:21:25,119 --> 01:21:31,809
give credit and I I feel like the the

1968
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:33,609
history and the story is a big part of

1969
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:35,119
why things are appealing and so I I

1970
01:21:33,609 --> 01:21:39,109
always

1971
01:21:35,118 --> 01:21:41,630
try to be as forthcoming and factual

1972
01:21:39,109 --> 01:21:43,670
with with all the information that we

1973
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:48,109
put out there about what we're working

1974
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:49,190
with and you know there's there's

1975
01:21:48,109 --> 01:21:50,630
companies out there that are just

1976
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:55,069
getting rid of the names altogether

1977
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:57,949
where it's it's it's the all the all the

1978
01:21:55,069 --> 01:21:59,599
history of you know hundreds of years of

1979
01:21:57,948 --> 01:22:02,269
people carrying this plants just wiped

1980
01:21:59,599 --> 01:22:04,909
away and now it's it's this new just a

1981
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:07,039
whole new way of categorizing things and

1982
01:22:04,908 --> 01:22:09,170
you know I don't know really how I feel

1983
01:22:07,038 --> 01:22:12,948
about that I like people being inventive

1984
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:17,960
and being unique but I'm also you know

1985
01:22:12,948 --> 01:22:19,669
very connected to the history and you

1986
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:22,880
know there's something that that might

1987
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:25,520
not sit so well about about just totally

1988
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:28,279
renaming people stuff you know maybe

1989
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:30,679
maybe if you come up with a name for a

1990
01:22:28,279 --> 01:22:33,408
specific Fino like that that could be

1991
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:36,679
okay but but still it's the the whatever

1992
01:22:33,408 --> 01:22:38,149
Fino of this strain from this person is

1993
01:22:36,679 --> 01:22:41,859
still be honest about where it came from

1994
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:44,509
and you can still name your fee nose and

1995
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:46,819
as far as protecting your genetics I

1996
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:49,820
think the open cannabis project or you

1997
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:53,960
know somehow doc documenting the genes

1998
01:22:49,819 --> 01:22:55,698
as open-source that's the only really

1999
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:57,109
other alternative to trying to patent

2000
01:22:55,698 --> 01:22:59,178
your stuff and keep other people from

2001
01:22:57,109 --> 01:23:00,859
having it I want other people to grow it

2002
01:22:59,179 --> 01:23:02,179
but I don't want people to grow it and

2003
01:23:00,859 --> 01:23:04,460
then take it from me and say I can't

2004
01:23:02,179 --> 01:23:05,929
grow it that's crazy and that's

2005
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:08,569
literally something that could be going

2006
01:23:05,929 --> 01:23:10,639
on right now we've got you know a number

2007
01:23:08,569 --> 01:23:13,368
of cannabis patents that have already

2008
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:15,230
been issued that are gonna be

2009
01:23:13,368 --> 01:23:17,170
problematic in the future I'm sure

2010
01:23:15,229 --> 01:23:20,569
there's gonna be challenges to them but

2011
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:22,038
I think one of them is any one to one

2012
01:23:20,569 --> 01:23:23,658
that doesn't have mercy and in it it's

2013
01:23:22,038 --> 01:23:25,639
technically under patent right now is

2014
01:23:23,658 --> 01:23:27,558
that correct there's there's something

2015
01:23:25,639 --> 01:23:29,239
there's some very broad cannabis patents

2016
01:23:27,559 --> 01:23:31,820
out there right now and I'm sure there's

2017
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:33,578
going to be more down the road and you

2018
01:23:31,819 --> 01:23:36,349
know documenting your genetics through

2019
01:23:33,578 --> 01:23:43,658
groups like the open cannabis project or

2020
01:23:36,349 --> 01:23:43,659
or you know a way to to combat that you

2021
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:54,798
the genetic data is fully important for

2022
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:57,599
a lot of reasons but it's harder to

2023
01:23:54,798 --> 01:23:59,819
translate that information to it's so

2024
01:23:57,599 --> 01:24:01,199
more chemo type data and getting

2025
01:23:59,819 --> 01:24:07,289
donations for that will be really useful

2026
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:08,728
to have prior argument so anybody that

2027
01:24:07,288 --> 01:24:13,139
didn't hear that he was saying chemo

2028
01:24:08,729 --> 01:24:18,229
type data is as or possibly more

2029
01:24:13,139 --> 01:24:22,588
important than the you know the genetic

2030
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:24,780
testing so yeah and and that that can be

2031
01:24:22,588 --> 01:24:27,179
hopefully a discussion all on to its own

2032
01:24:24,779 --> 01:24:28,378
that's I would love to delve deeper into

2033
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:31,168
that and how we can protect the

2034
01:24:28,378 --> 01:24:32,849
community's work as a whole one thing I

2035
01:24:31,168 --> 01:24:35,219
wanted to touch on is you know yeah when

2036
01:24:32,849 --> 01:24:36,838
when you talk about you know you're

2037
01:24:35,219 --> 01:24:38,998
saying you're gonna go try and sell your

2038
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:41,878
product to people assume self-interest

2039
01:24:38,998 --> 01:24:43,889
and so they always take whatever you say

2040
01:24:41,878 --> 01:24:46,139
with a grain of salt but if they

2041
01:24:43,889 --> 01:24:48,689
overhear it from their friend that says

2042
01:24:46,139 --> 01:24:51,599
no no his stuffs dope I like that or I

2043
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:56,128
like this type and and you're gonna take

2044
01:24:51,599 --> 01:25:01,199
that you're gonna take that in maybe a

2045
01:24:56,128 --> 01:25:05,038
little more deeper or what I'm trying to

2046
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:06,688
say is is support your community and the

2047
01:25:05,038 --> 01:25:10,788
other people if you see something that

2048
01:25:06,689 --> 01:25:13,079
you like you know let people know and

2049
01:25:10,788 --> 01:25:15,748
hopefully others are gonna return the

2050
01:25:13,078 --> 01:25:18,948
favor to you and and that that's I feel

2051
01:25:15,748 --> 01:25:24,658
how we build the community together and

2052
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:27,928
help help each other survive so so you

2053
01:25:24,658 --> 01:25:29,668
know definitely I think people take it

2054
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:31,739
into account a little more when when

2055
01:25:29,668 --> 01:25:33,208
they hear it you know around you know

2056
01:25:31,738 --> 01:25:34,708
through somebody else or through the

2057
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:37,588
grapevine or I heard that this that's

2058
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:39,118
that's how hype builds is is you know

2059
01:25:37,588 --> 01:25:41,548
people over here from somewhere else

2060
01:25:39,118 --> 01:25:45,179
that oh that's the one and and yeah

2061
01:25:41,548 --> 01:25:47,219
there is something that's that's you

2062
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:49,109
know genuine to that is there's there's

2063
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:51,618
reasons behind why those things got

2064
01:25:49,109 --> 01:25:52,949
built up it can't all just be pure

2065
01:25:51,618 --> 01:25:54,599
advertising or

2066
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:57,289
you know there's there's got to be some

2067
01:25:54,600 --> 01:26:02,640
you know human element to why something

2068
01:25:57,289 --> 01:26:04,319
you know become successful and so yeah

2069
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,969
just support support your neighbor

2070
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:08,639
support when they're doing good let

2071
01:26:05,969 --> 01:26:11,069
people know it you know and and I think

2072
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:13,199
that that from all of us that came from

2073
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:16,590
the era where you didn't rat on people

2074
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:19,859
which seems to be a foreign thought

2075
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:22,170
nowadays ratting out on people screwing

2076
01:26:19,859 --> 01:26:23,339
people over isn't ratting and so when

2077
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:25,710
he's saying you know make sure you

2078
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:28,380
support make sure you also call out

2079
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:30,060
things that you see wrong because that

2080
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,630
they're screwing him they're gonna screw

2081
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,310
you

2082
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:34,440
and by the time they get to you they

2083
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:35,580
might not be anybody protect you and so

2084
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:37,799
a lot of it is if you're seeing

2085
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:39,448
unscrupulous stuff you don't have to get

2086
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:41,550
out and broadcasted on the general world

2087
01:26:39,448 --> 01:26:43,319
but you can tell your friends man I get

2088
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:47,190
asked all the time about would you do

2089
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:49,439
business with this person and I try not

2090
01:26:47,189 --> 01:26:51,750
to screw anybody in the way that would

2091
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:53,519
cause problems but ultimately if I know

2092
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:55,829
that you have a history of pikin people

2093
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:59,040
I always just say the same thing I would

2094
01:26:55,829 --> 01:27:01,079
be cautious and what that means is that

2095
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:02,369
I can't give you a recommendation and

2096
01:27:01,079 --> 01:27:04,050
that you should do your homework so I

2097
01:27:02,369 --> 01:27:05,698
don't have to go too deep into it but it

2098
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:08,190
just says that I can't vouch for you but

2099
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:10,889
I'm not gonna throw a rock at you that's

2100
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:12,539
throwing a rock at you and and that's

2101
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:14,250
important because someone said would you

2102
01:27:12,539 --> 01:27:17,069
work with that distribute or I'd say I

2103
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:19,770
would be cautious and then they realize

2104
01:27:17,069 --> 01:27:22,619
that there's some reason because I'm not

2105
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:26,280
in a business against them so therefore

2106
01:27:22,619 --> 01:27:27,809
why am I having trepidation and it's

2107
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:29,159
because I saw something or heard

2108
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:31,440
something and I'm just like look you

2109
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:32,460
don't need to get screwed either so you

2110
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:34,619
don't have to go and you know

2111
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,510
shish-kabob um but if people are doing

2112
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:38,099
good work you know make sure you let

2113
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:41,670
people know and if and if people are

2114
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:43,620
doing stuff that are unethical in a way

2115
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:45,899
that's gonna really cause problems

2116
01:27:43,619 --> 01:27:47,279
they're not gonna hold back against you

2117
01:27:45,899 --> 01:27:49,109
either most people hold back because

2118
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:50,399
they're afraid of ramification they're

2119
01:27:49,109 --> 01:27:51,299
afraid back in the day was they're

2120
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:53,729
afraid they're gonna lose all their

2121
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:55,140
teeth well now that that's not one of

2122
01:27:53,729 --> 01:27:56,399
the tools and I don't really think it

2123
01:27:55,140 --> 01:28:01,130
should be a tool but it was a very

2124
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:04,559
effective one you have to be able to use

2125
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:06,210
financial and financial is to protect

2126
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,989
each other and make sure that the people

2127
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:09,300
that are doing the

2128
01:28:06,988 --> 01:28:10,859
work on getting beat to death and that

2129
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:14,670
they're still around for you to utilize

2130
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:16,408
as a resource and you you have to

2131
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:18,179
preserve as many these resources as

2132
01:28:16,408 --> 01:28:20,908
possible because without it you end up

2133
01:28:18,179 --> 01:28:24,118
having a shrunken population of partners

2134
01:28:20,908 --> 01:28:26,098
to do stuff in the future and for me

2135
01:28:24,118 --> 01:28:28,139
like what I've done my whole career I've

2136
01:28:26,099 --> 01:28:31,319
needed the people around because I only

2137
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:32,489
can do so much myself and my success was

2138
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:34,380
really built off of all these

2139
01:28:32,488 --> 01:28:37,018
relationships I made with other people

2140
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:40,739
and over the course of time we did

2141
01:28:37,019 --> 01:28:49,650
better than we did worse so don't

2142
01:28:40,738 --> 01:28:51,598
anybody screw you yes yes I believe so

2143
01:28:49,649 --> 01:28:53,279
that what you could do is if you did a

2144
01:28:51,599 --> 01:28:55,019
licensing agreement with the breeder you

2145
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:57,389
could also bring material that you have

2146
01:28:55,019 --> 01:28:59,159
and do collaborative projects that

2147
01:28:57,389 --> 01:29:01,859
material would then be able to be

2148
01:28:59,158 --> 01:29:03,988
jointly promoted you'd be able to have

2149
01:29:01,859 --> 01:29:05,549
stock that was unique to you because all

2150
01:29:03,988 --> 01:29:07,288
the material from the cross would be

2151
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:09,059
held the tool you could figure out what

2152
01:29:07,288 --> 01:29:11,969
was the cultivar you wanted to release

2153
01:29:09,059 --> 01:29:13,619
into the public as production material

2154
01:29:11,969 --> 01:29:15,658
not as a cultivar unless you're building

2155
01:29:13,618 --> 01:29:17,368
a nursery if you're building a nursery

2156
01:29:15,658 --> 01:29:19,259
then you said hey dad I want to work

2157
01:29:17,368 --> 01:29:20,729
with you on a project I would love to

2158
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:22,230
take some of the stuff you're doing put

2159
01:29:20,729 --> 01:29:24,569
with something I'm doing let's find a

2160
01:29:22,229 --> 01:29:26,908
cut let's put it into the market let's

2161
01:29:24,569 --> 01:29:27,599
both be honest did the shit work yeah

2162
01:29:26,908 --> 01:29:29,399
there's a good one

2163
01:29:27,599 --> 01:29:31,559
and then I'll both you can do combined

2164
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:33,238
breeding and you can do licensing that

2165
01:29:31,559 --> 01:29:36,179
allows you to be able to use your

2166
01:29:33,238 --> 01:29:37,799
respective IP and then you can then find

2167
01:29:36,179 --> 01:29:39,538
individuals that you can license the

2168
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:41,730
clone to because one of the problems is

2169
01:29:39,538 --> 01:29:43,859
overproduction of varietals and so you

2170
01:29:41,729 --> 01:29:45,388
end up out competing the success because

2171
01:29:43,859 --> 01:29:48,179
you got too much of the same material

2172
01:29:45,389 --> 01:29:49,920
and you know that I think that's crucial

2173
01:29:48,179 --> 01:29:51,449
but I think a lot of us just need more

2174
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,779
legal help with that where we need to

2175
01:29:51,448 --> 01:29:55,618
have more people like Beth come in and

2176
01:29:53,779 --> 01:29:56,550
attorneys that were like present was

2177
01:29:55,618 --> 01:29:58,408
great to have an attorney present

2178
01:29:56,550 --> 01:30:00,210
yesterday because he could kind of say

2179
01:29:58,408 --> 01:30:02,339
listen this is how we see this happen

2180
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:04,050
and then you're able to get a better

2181
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:05,880
idea because I don't think any of us so

2182
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:08,190
at least 95% of us haven't have been

2183
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,859
involved in patent protection of genomic

2184
01:30:08,189 --> 01:30:12,149
material you know I mean I'm someone

2185
01:30:10,859 --> 01:30:13,348
messing around all the time but it's

2186
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:14,939
that's not what I do I still have

2187
01:30:13,349 --> 01:30:16,139
lawyers that I work with because I don't

2188
01:30:14,939 --> 01:30:18,178
have time to go to law school and I

2189
01:30:16,139 --> 01:30:19,969
don't want oh it's not my thing

2190
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:22,969
but I need them

2191
01:30:19,969 --> 01:30:25,189
yeah I think licensing is cool because

2192
01:30:22,969 --> 01:30:30,829
really a license is just a contract

2193
01:30:25,189 --> 01:30:33,710
between you and your associate and you

2194
01:30:30,829 --> 01:30:36,738
know it certainly it's not you know as

2195
01:30:33,710 --> 01:30:40,460
binding as something like a patent it's

2196
01:30:36,738 --> 01:30:42,829
it's but it it's more voluntary and I

2197
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:45,020
really I do encourage folks to do that

2198
01:30:42,829 --> 01:30:47,719
kind of thing I mean they look at you

2199
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:51,500
know jeans pre-rolled line like you know

2200
01:30:47,719 --> 01:30:55,630
that's in a way like that's good for

2201
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:58,779
everybody because you know that pre-roll

2202
01:30:55,630 --> 01:31:02,270
person might not have had quite such a

2203
01:30:58,779 --> 01:31:04,789
namesake or following and so you know

2204
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:06,920
it's good for their pre-rolls and and

2205
01:31:04,789 --> 01:31:11,119
it's cool for Jean because he gets

2206
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:15,649
credit all that stuff and just one more

2207
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:18,710
thing like I I keep hearing you know

2208
01:31:15,649 --> 01:31:20,869
everybody we're all a little scared and

2209
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:23,300
we all like know that the these big

2210
01:31:20,869 --> 01:31:28,599
powers that have deep deep pockets are

2211
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:32,239
coming and you know you might sort of

2212
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:36,560
react to it and do something that you

2213
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:38,509
might not otherwise do you know get rid

2214
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:41,480
of all your your purple strains or

2215
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:45,280
something dumb like that but just

2216
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:52,729
remember that like when booze became

2217
01:31:45,279 --> 01:31:58,069
legal there wasn't like a Jim Beam or

2218
01:31:52,729 --> 01:32:03,109
there wasn't Budweiser or Coors those

2219
01:31:58,069 --> 01:32:07,779
kind of evolved out of you know they're

2220
01:32:03,109 --> 01:32:12,049
being quick and and successes but then

2221
01:32:07,779 --> 01:32:14,149
you know or in the mid-90s all of a

2222
01:32:12,050 --> 01:32:16,880
sudden there was this thing that came

2223
01:32:14,149 --> 01:32:19,969
out it was like micro beer and I never

2224
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:23,930
thought in a million years that there'd

2225
01:32:19,969 --> 01:32:27,770
still be breweries opening in Humboldt

2226
01:32:23,930 --> 01:32:30,829
County that are thriving and just the

2227
01:32:27,770 --> 01:32:32,769
same with wine like but it takes a while

2228
01:32:30,829 --> 01:32:36,460
for that to kind of

2229
01:32:32,769 --> 01:32:39,519
mature like you don't go into the gas

2230
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:44,760
station down the you know over Piercy or

2231
01:32:39,519 --> 01:32:44,760
whatever and and stick your nose up at

2232
01:32:44,849 --> 01:32:49,690
the new microbrews but you do after good

2233
01:32:47,889 --> 01:32:51,519
you know maybe you do or maybe don't but

2234
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:54,669
at the Korres I like PBR I don't know

2235
01:32:51,519 --> 01:32:58,269
but that stuff hasn't had a chance to

2236
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:59,769
really like you know like the PBRs and

2237
01:32:58,269 --> 01:33:02,860
the course and the Budweiser's of

2238
01:32:59,769 --> 01:33:05,440
cannabis no one knows that that's who

2239
01:33:02,859 --> 01:33:07,768
they are yet and so it's gonna take at

2240
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:11,368
least probably like another year maybe

2241
01:33:07,769 --> 01:33:15,550
two before that really develops and then

2242
01:33:11,368 --> 01:33:18,729
what I what I'm really confident about

2243
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:21,840
is that the you know the regenerative

2244
01:33:18,729 --> 01:33:25,569
and the small and the real craft

2245
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:29,949
actually then starts to have its you

2246
01:33:25,569 --> 01:33:33,549
know days in the Sun you know pun

2247
01:33:29,948 --> 01:33:36,279
intended and you know and I think that's

2248
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:38,829
the same with strains - I mean God

2249
01:33:36,279 --> 01:33:41,469
remember how freaking long it was just

2250
01:33:38,828 --> 01:33:43,840
impossible to you know like its you just

2251
01:33:41,469 --> 01:33:45,609
had to grow OG and then you grew a bunch

2252
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:49,690
of this really cool awesome stuff for

2253
01:33:45,609 --> 01:33:52,569
your head and but you just always you

2254
01:33:49,689 --> 01:33:56,379
know kind of had to grow a G and I think

2255
01:33:52,569 --> 01:33:58,509
that that's kind of changed too so you

2256
01:33:56,380 --> 01:34:03,489
know let's just remember that we are

2257
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:05,829
pioneers and like I think you know what

2258
01:34:03,488 --> 01:34:08,288
me and gene said about like well I'm not

2259
01:34:05,828 --> 01:34:11,439
ignoring the fact that the markets

2260
01:34:08,288 --> 01:34:15,279
saying one thing but I'm also not giving

2261
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:17,229
up on where my frickin roots are and

2262
01:34:15,279 --> 01:34:19,408
where my convictions lie and stuff like

2263
01:34:17,229 --> 01:34:19,408
that

2264
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,939

2266
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:34,460
wrap this up because we got a little big

2267
01:34:33,229 --> 01:34:36,229
going on we're burning through some time

2268
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:37,789

show up and answer the questions and

2273
01:34:42,409 --> 01:34:45,079

2274
01:34:43,729 --> 01:34:48,199
work with you for as long as I've known

2275

2276
