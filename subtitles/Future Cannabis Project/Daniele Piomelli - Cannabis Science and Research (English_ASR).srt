00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,440
my task is to bring you to the world of

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,760
medicine and i' like to start off with h

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,679
an email I received not long ago this is

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,640
one of the emails I receive uh basically

6
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:29,320
daily so I'm going to read it for you so

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,399
dear Dr P it says I have read about your

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,159
work on marijuana

9
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,600
I'm the father of a three-year-old girl

10
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:38,199
diagnosed with

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,439
autism I would walk through fire to get

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,800
her a

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:47,359
cure can my want help my

14
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:51,078
girl I got to say I've read this to

15
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:53,640
people so many times every time I read

16
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,960
it it curdles my

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,079
blood as a father as a

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,960
scientist I got to ask myself what what

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,478
is this man asking for me for me as a

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,599
scientist what can I do to answer this

21
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:12,478
question and the question that so many

22
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:17,118
other people are

23
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:19,759
asking can cannabis help in what can it

24
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,519
help as a scientist I have to put these

25
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,560
questions in a different

26
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:27,000
way I have to

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,519
ask what medical conditions if any can

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,399
really benefit from cannabis

29
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,280
what are the risks associated with

30
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,439
cannabis because there is no such a

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:41,079
thing as a benefit without a

32
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:45,118
risk and what can cannabis teach us that

33
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:47,718
may lead in general to better

34
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:51,000
therapies and as we approach these

35
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:52,959
questions I like to make very very clear

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,239
that emotions are

37
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,519
wonderful but we need

38
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:01,718
evidence we need

39
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,718
data we need evidencebased

40
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,039
answers opinions are great for debates

41
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,840
but when it comes to

42
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,280
decisions I think they have to be

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,319
tempered by

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,878
facts so I'm going to share with you

45
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:19,000
some facts and being a professor I

46
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,560
brought my slides and uh I'll walk you

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,878
through them I promise there will be

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,640
many chemical

49
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:28,959
structures

50
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:32,439
not so how does cannabis work many of

51
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,680
you know this let me just remind you it

52
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:38,199
contains chemicals one of them is quite

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,040
famous is called THC another one is

54
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,719
called CBD and the structure of one of

55
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,120
these compounds is shown so one of them

56
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,919
is shown here

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,239
THC so how does it work well when people

58
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,919
use the compound use the drug it enters

59
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,640
their brains and it Encounters in their

60
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:00,679
brains A protein that sits on the cell

61
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,878
on the surface of the brain cells these

62
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,080
are called neurons and these particular

63
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,079
proteins that

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,280
recognized THC in cannabis just like a

65
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,599
key is recognized by a lock these

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,080
proteins are called the cannabinoid

67
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,000
receptors and we have a ton of

68
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,000
cannabinoid receptors in the brain and

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,360
they are spread throughout the brain

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,719
they're present in specific regions of

71
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
the brain but also they're very very

72
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,719
very

73
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,438
abundant and what do they do when they

74
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:34,000
are activated by THC

75
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:36,799
well what they do is something similar

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,878
to what they do when they are activated

77
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,120
but they're our own compounds what I I

78
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:45,518
call the brain's own cannabis our brain

79
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,039
makes chemicals that have chemical

80
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,158
structures different from those of THC

81
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,759
but similar enough that they will

82
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:56,560
recognize the canabo receptor just like

83
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:58,359
THC does these compound are endogenous

84
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,039
cannabinoids so we call them

85
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,720
endocannabinoids just to sound

86
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,359
smart what do they do they do a lot of

87
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:11,039
different things and they're really

88
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,959
important things they control feeling

89
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:19,639
they control emotion they control

90
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:22,240
pain memory as well as

91
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,800
pleasure these are the functions of a

92
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,160
molecule our body

93
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,280
makes and we experience it every day as

94
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,240
we live our our lives these molecules

95
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,359
are regulating these different functions

96
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,879
of our body we should be aware of that

97
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,240
because it's very important to

98
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:44,000
understand what then cannabis does to

99
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,759
this endogenous system what does it do

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,720
well by activating the cannabinoid

101
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,479
receptors in the brain THC will produce

102
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479
the effects that I'm sure you're quite

103
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:58,038
familiar with because your friends told

104
00:04:54,478 --> 00:05:01,360
them about them it stimulates appetite

105
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:04,959
it relieves anxiety it alleviates pain

106
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,840
it impairs short-term memory and also it

107
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,279
can be

108
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,239
addictive these are the effects of THC

109
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,799
that pharmacologists like me that's my

110
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,840
job I'm a

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,720
pharmacologist pharmacologists like me

112
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,959
have over the last 30 years

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,360
characterized but how can we use these

114
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:25,159
effects from a therapeutic perspective

115
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,360
which once of these effects which we

116
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,120
have studied in the mouse in the rat in

117
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,080
the monkey and also in people can

118
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,120
actually turn into a real therapy and

119
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,240
this is what I'm going to try to briefly

120
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,319
go over with you in the next couple of

121
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,759
minutes the first one the one I want to

122
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,439
really stress and I wish this is if you

123
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,759
have to only take one thing out of my

124
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:49,038
boring lecture tonight is this chronic

125
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,720
pain one in 10 Americans experiences at

126
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,038
least once in their life excruciating

127
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:58,400
pain that comes from damaged nerve or

128
00:05:54,038 --> 00:06:00,519
from inflammation chronic pain is

129
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,638
profoundly regulated by the

130
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,079
endocannabinoid system endocannabinoid

131
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,639
system is actually one of the main

132
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,478
Regulators of pain along with the other

133
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,079
system you have heard

134
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:16,758
before Congressman Nora Baker mentioned

135
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:19,439
the opid system the two systems are go

136
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,720
hand in hand and we have I'm going to

137
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,519
show you some

138
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:28,080
data we have data showing very very

139
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:30,478
clearly that comparing a placebo to a

140
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,959
cannabis the cannabis will perform

141
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:37,279
better than the placebo in alleviating

142
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,680
pain intensity in humans in

143
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,918
fact the Academy of Science the National

144
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,598
Academy of Science in a panel I was

145
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:48,399
honored to be a member

146
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:50,560
of uh last January concluded as you can

147
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,879
see written here in the slide that there

148
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,478
is conclusive and substantial evidence

149
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:59,879
that cannabis is effective as a

150
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:02,758
treatment of chronic pain in adults this

151
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:05,680
is a statement that comes straight out

152
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,240
of the conclusion of a study that

153
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,959
involved nine months of work looking at

154
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,840
24,000 papers and let me tell you being

155
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:17,399
a member of that committee I it was not

156
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,399
exactly a walk in the in the

157
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:22,560
woods chronic pain another one very very

158
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,759
important chemotherapy indu nausea and

159
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,478
vomiting I'm how many of us tonight have

160
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,800
family or themselves who have gone

161
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,519
through the ordeal of having

162
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,759
chemotherapy or experiencing one of

163
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,758
their family with

164
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,680
chemotherapy well THC in cannabis but

165
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,360
also

166
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,879
CBD the other component of cannabis they

167
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,240
act in regions of the brain that

168
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,879
stimulate appetite and reduce nausea so

169
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,199
this is an effect I like to stress that

170
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:57,479
is opposite to what the opes do opposite

171
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,038
so the opat cause nausea the

172
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,120
cannabinoids decrease it and the again

173
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:05,839
the National Academy of Sciences

174
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,918
concluded that cannabis

175
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,839
is useful as a treatment for it's not

176
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:12,799
potentially useful it's useful as a

177
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:17,038
treatment for chemotherapy induced

178
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,000
nausea and vomiting finally the third

179
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,959
indications on with the which National

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,120
Academy was extremely clear is

181
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,399
spasticity in multiple sclerosis

182
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,079
multiple sclerosis is accompanied as you

183
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:32,360
will know by these muscle spasms that

184
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:34,478
are extremely extreme ex painful and THC

185
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,599
acts to alleviate those spasms and again

186
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,719
this is the third and actually last

187
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,560
indication that the national ecademy has

188
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:46,080
recognized as being uh definitive and

189
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,479
having substantial support from evidence

190
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,399
now the National Academy also studied

191
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,399
other

192
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,240
indications and these are indications

193
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,759
that are often Allowed by States in

194
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,480
which medicinal cannabis is legal as

195
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,720
indications in which cannabis can be

196
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,680
prescribed however

197
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,800
the data do not support necessarily that

198
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,078
they do not support that and don't

199
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,240
necessarily support the opposite the

200
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:13,359
data are not there yet we do for example

201
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease

202
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,480
cancers

203
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,079
autism post-traumatic stress

204
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,039
disorder these are all diseases in which

205
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:27,078
there is a lot of anecdotal evidence but

206
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:30,078
anecdotes do not no matter how exciting

207
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:32,639
they can be they not amount to proof to

208
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:36,199
evidence that we can use so we need what

209
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,000
do we need well we need a lot of work to

210
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,959
establish efficacies in these other

211
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,320
indications we need to establish basing

212
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:47,119
basing ourselves on the anecdotes we

213
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:52,160
have now ask the question are these

214
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,440
anecdotes valid for you you you you or

215
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,838
are just valid for the one person that

216
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,839
has told us about it that's an important

217
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,399
point so let's look at the other side of

218
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,880
the coin let's let's look at the risks

219
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,039
the first risk I want to put out there

220
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,879
for all of you and please do bring that

221
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:10,599
home and please do talk to your families

222
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:15,039
about it is using expecting and nursing

223
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:17,159
mothers I strongly recommend being very

224
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,319
very careful if you're expecting you

225
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:23,958
think you're expecting or if you're if

226
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:27,079
you're nursing to use cannabis and the

227
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:31,239
reason for that is that THC crosses the

228
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:34,559
barrier that defends the fetus from the

229
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,639
uh from the blood crosses it and it

230
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:40,559
accumulates in the fetus and so does in

231
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:44,959
the milk so the the infant will be

232
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:47,278
exposed to THC to CBD and we do not know

233
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,199
what that what that could bring about as

234
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,120
consequences which just simply don't

235
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,720
know while we don't know I say better

236
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,240
safe than sorry just don't do it

237
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,839
similarly

238
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,440
teenagers the brain of a teenager is

239
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,399
Extreme ex remely changing every day

240
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,040
don't we all know that who are

241
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,919
parents and obviously we want we want to

242
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:13,240
be sure that they are this growth is not

243
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:16,719
interfered with by anything not alcohol

244
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,959
not tobacco not marijuana either and

245
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,680
especially the frequent news of

246
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,239
marijuana we have to be careful about

247
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,039
for reason I would love to be able to

248
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,360
entertain you with with a very boring

249
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,799
two hour long lecture but I

250
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,600
won't there are a couple of other things

251
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,159
that one needs to be careful about

252
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,639
people who suffer from schizophrenia

253
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,278
people who have heart conditions should

254
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,039
be careful with with cannabis so this is

255
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,078
why this is medical cannabis because

256
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:43,759
it's going to be it has to be handled by

257
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,838
professionals by medical professionals

258
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,439
and an additional work is needed to

259
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,360
understand and fully assess those

260
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,760
risks so I'm going to conclude by asking

261
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,800
by saying a couple of things that I

262
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:56,838
think we can get done in the next five

263
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,000
years not in the next 50 years but

264
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,760
really in the next five years and I

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,519
would love to be able to be part of that

266
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,679
I think we say that we can say the last

267
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,679
word on cannabis Effectiveness in a

268
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,479
series of clinical indications for which

269
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:12,039
we still have no evidence of efficacy

270
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,120
for example Parkinson or

271
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:16,120
anxiety we can assess the risk

272
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,799
associated with medicinal cannabis use

273
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,839
which are probably going to be different

274
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,639
from those associated with with the

275
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,399
recreational cannabis

276
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,959
use and I think we need to leverage we

277
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,240
need to use our new knowledge to create

278
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,039
better cannabinoid based medicines to go

279
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:35,198
Beyond even cannabis and help the

280
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:37,599
patients in many other ways now in

281
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:41,679
conclusion I want to go back to the to

282
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:46,920
the email I received from this Anonymous

283
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:50,078
person can we help his girl yes I think

284
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:52,479
we can not right now but to be able to

285
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:55,039
answer that question

286
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,680
appropriately we need a societal

287
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:00,958
commitment to reduce regulatory hurdles

288
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,719
and to to support research and in

289
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,599
particular I want to say to deschedule

290
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,759
or

291
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,639
reschedule cannabis from schedule one to

292
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,519
a lower

293
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:18,039
schedule to make possible the research

294
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,039
that we need thank you very

295
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,399
much Dr pelli uh you write an email that

296
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:27,958
pretty much took the air out of the room

297
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,958
everybody just gasped at getting such an

298
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,958
email

299
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,079
so and I know in your position it's you

300
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,278
don't want to give advice but let's say

301
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,919
one of

302
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,320
us received that question perhaps we

303
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,958
have a relative that is dying of cancer

304
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,240
or is going through chemotherapy and

305
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:50,119
they ask us what do you know should I

306
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,360
should I try cannabis or should

307
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,560
I try some more conventional medicine

308
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,159
what would your advice be I say go to

309
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:03,479
your doctor uh speak to her or him and

310
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:06,078
and explain uh to your doctor that uh

311
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,639
you believe that this could be uh useful

312
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,439
for you what I try to do when people ask

313
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,959
me that question I also try to share

314
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,759
with them um some data so for example if

315
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:20,159
it's a cancer patient suffering from

316
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:23,320
great pain then I send these these folks

317
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,719
um uh scientific papers scientific

318
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,519
papers you know through the email and I

319
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,560
said bring this with you when you see

320
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,919
your physician

321
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,919
this is the Journal of the American

322
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:35,719
Medical Association it's not the Journal

323
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:38,039
of psychedelic studies it's something

324
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,040
very very serious and you have to take

325
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,078
it seriously that's all I can do as a

326
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,639
basic

327
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:48,479
scientist got thank you uh in your in

328
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,240
your slid show you mentioned under risk

329
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,920
factor

330
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,240
addiction um there's a lot of talk that

331
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:57,278
I'm seeing this this kind of nent

332
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,278
movement planted over pills and we

333
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,879
probably have a number of people here

334
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,879
that have read about cannabis or

335
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:07,078
thinking maybe I might try some can you

336
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:10,720
expand on addiction and cannabis let me

337
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:13,958
first start off by uh stating what is

338
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,079
addiction in the medical dictionary so a

339
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:20,799
behavior that we pursue despite our

340
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:24,000
knowledge that is hurting us that's an

341
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,359
addictive behavior so addiction is not

342
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,159
dependence you can become dependent on a

343
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,800
number of different things and as you

344
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:35,360
became dependent you can also regain

345
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,639
full control you know in a process that

346
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,318
is complex but it can be done addiction

347
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,039
is different addiction is also a disease

348
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:45,360
of the brain it's not a problem of will

349
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,198
it's a disease it's a chronic disease of

350
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,600
the

351
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:52,479
brain now does cannabis cause addiction

352
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,680
when we think addiction about addiction

353
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,480
in the terms I just shared with you we

354
00:15:54,679 --> 00:16:00,638
always think the first thing we think

355
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:04,399
about is opiates crack

356
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:08,759
cocaine alcohol those are things that

357
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,480
devastating forms of addiction that um

358
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,240
we are familiar from a even from a

359
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,920
filmic standpoint we remember the movies

360
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,318
right you know and how people in the

361
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,958
movies with addiction behave and we

362
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:25,120
think well cannabis doesn't do that and

363
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:27,559
it's true cannabis does not do that the

364
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,600
type of addiction that cannabis causes

365
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,638
and now I think all special ists agree

366
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,600
uh we really no acts to grind that

367
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,278
cannabist does cause addiction the can

368
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,120
the type of can of addiction cannabis

369
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:44,559
causes is of a different type uh it's

370
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,799
milder it's harder to get but it's there

371
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,958
so it say 8% of the people you use it

372
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:53,879
become eventually can become eventually

373
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,758
addicted 8% doesn't seem a big number if

374
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:59,480
you compare it to the

375
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:04,599
45% you have with nicotine or the

376
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:06,640
35 40% you have with h cocaine it seems

377
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,879
like a small number but if a lot of

378
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,880
people use it that the small number is

379
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,079
going to translate into a lot of people

380
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,000
that small percentage into a lot of

381
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:18,918
people so I think uh we need to be

382
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,919
cognizant of this and ask ourselves

383
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,640
always when we talk about medical

384
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,079
cannabis because that's my main my main

385
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,240
concern uh what are we comparing

386
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:31,678
cannabis to so uh I I spoke about

387
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,279
chronic pain and there is a reason for

388
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,320
that because it's the one condition that

389
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:39,240
I believe offers the greatest uh uh

390
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:42,200
promise for cannabis and of course the

391
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,038
big comparator there is what the

392
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,480
opioids and we I don't think it needs

393
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:50,000
any introduction to anybody that the

394
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,160
opioids although very very effective are

395
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
extremely addictive drugs they're very

396
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,200
very addictive and there is no question

397
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,640
that if we compare cannabis to the

398
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,720
opioids the addictive properties of

399
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,559
cannabis are much milder than those of

400
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,839
the

401
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,558
opioids we know this for these are facts

402
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,079
but then there are a lot of questions

403
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:13,359
and I think we need to answer some of

404
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:16,319
those question let me let me point to

405
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,399
one in particular if we combine cannabis

406
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,240
and opiates what happens that's

407
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,880
something we need to ask because our

408
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,839
youth are going to do that and also our

409
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,080
patients are going to do

410
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,279
that we don't really know what happens

411
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,798
in the long term and we know what

412
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,720
happens in the short term in the short

413
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:33,679
term if you combine a small dose of an

414
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,038
opiate and a small dose of cannabis you

415
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,200
got a lot of painkilling effect so

416
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:41,359
that's called a cism with potentiation

417
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,759
in in case you care but but the problem

418
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,479
is in the long run are we enhancing the

419
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,960
possibility of getting an addiction to

420
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,159
either drug or are we decreasing it

421
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,159
that's again goes to the my last slide

422
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,159
we need resarch on this

423
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,720
hi my name is John stashenko and I have

424
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,679
a question for Dr pelli and Dr reard um

425
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,319
I was wondering if in your research if

426
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,159
either one of you have found or know

427
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,759
where we could find a list of

428
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,760
contraindications for cannabis medicines

429
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,400
you are asking about contraindications

430
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,440
to cannabis medicines I I tried to cover

431
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,038
some of the uh of the potential risks uh

432
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,279
in my presentation certainly um I think

433
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:31,319
it's important to avoid usage in uh uh

434
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:34,240
during pregnancy and during uh nursing

435
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:36,879
as well as in in adolescence at this

436
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,640
point I think is critical that we uh

437
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,880
before we make any proposal about use of

438
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:46,440
cannabis products in adolescent or

439
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,520
younger uh younger kids um we assess in

440
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,798
that condition in those conditions what

441
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:53,558
the safety of the product is I think

442
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:56,839
that is something we really owe to the

443
00:19:53,558 --> 00:20:00,000
public as far as other specific uh

444
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:01,599
Contra indications um

445
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,079
actually

446
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,759
um medical use is likely to be different

447
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,599
from recreational use so what we have

448
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:12,000
learned from recreational use might turn

449
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,279
out to be outdated so that's one reason

450
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,558
why I pointed out that one thing that we

451
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,798
we do need in the future is to really

452
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:22,480
specifically ask the question medical

453
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:25,558
use say in the elderly is it going to be

454
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,000
uh causing specific effects that we do

455
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:31,079
not expect let me just elaborate on this

456
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,759
a little bit so if you um if you

457
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:35,000
consider for example the use of cannabis

458
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,759
in in young people one thing that

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,440
cannabis does do it makes

460
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:44,240
you shortens your memory that that's

461
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,798
something that that happens all the time

462
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,480
now that happens in young people does it

463
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,158
happen in older people in elderly people

464
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,839
we don't really know because the system

465
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:57,000
the famous endoc canaban system i i i b

466
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,399
everybody with is really changing

467
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,440
changes during life to to the point that

468
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,440
in in late adulthood and in old age it

469
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:08,120
might be actually have opposite effects

470
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,360
those it has during adolesence so if

471
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:12,199
this is the case then we really all all

472
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:13,798
the all the bets are off and we don't

473
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,038
really know what side effects could

474
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:20,480
happen in you know in a medical uh say

475
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:22,359
50 or 60 or 70 year old uh subject you

476
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,150
see what I'm saying a lot of research is

477
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:30,278
still needed

478
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:32,759
[Music]

479
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:32,759
he
