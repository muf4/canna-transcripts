2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:10,320
some of the difficulties of building up

3
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:12,039
the sales Avenues of the business and

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,880
really getting the business started once

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,799
we had secured the the funding the

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,000
equipment in the place um were it was a

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,199
big challenge so how do you find

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,198
cultivators when they're all you know

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,880
hiding and they don't want to be found

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,920
well the the only place you can really

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,879
find them is that that M Mutual meetings

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,160
bought the dispensaries those are public

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,200
they're out there everyone can find them

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,840
online or in other places so we thought

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,920
that would be the first Target for us

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,480
was we're just going to find a list of

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,719
dispensaries in Southern California

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,878
we're going to go start knocking on

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,840
doors we're going to put our you know

20
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,439
the press the flesh they say or put our

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,719
boots on the ground and really just go

22
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,039
out there and start talking to everybody

23
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,239
and you you get a quick sense of wow

24
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,960
there's a very insignificant

25
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,000
understanding about what testing is and

26
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,799
what it really means most people hate

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,558
the idea of a test usually means it's

28
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,919
something you're probably going to fail

29
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:02,959
uh you know no one likes to test at the

30
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,960
DMV no one likes to test at the schools

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,439
no one likes to be tested for anything

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,759
so quickly you come to well I shouldn't

33
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,679
go in there and say I'm a tester and I'm

34
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:11,920
going to test all your stuff that's

35
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,479
probably not going to lend towards

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,159
continuing the conversation and really

37
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:17,560
helping you go forward so it was how do

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,280
you frame the approach and you say look

39
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,680
I'm here to help you find the best

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,840
things for your patients we're here to

41
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,720
help you screen the quality of products

42
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,280
that you've got and help everyone

43
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,879
understand that you know there is

44
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,519
quality control and assurance and that

45
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,438
your supply chain is really what you're

46
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,118
hoping it would be and that they can

47
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,919
start to understand the dosing that

48
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,118
they're using and can effectively use

49
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,920
the medicine that's cost effective for

50
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,118
them and the cost that we're going to

51
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,118
add to you coming in here to do this

52
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:46,478
service is very nominal so if I can come

53
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:48,438
into your dispensary location I would

54
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,560
like to select samples out of every bag

55
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:53,039
that you hold and I can show up once a

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,359
week or on a regular basis uh to your

57
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,360
liking and offer these battery of tests

58
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,438
that you guys could start with that was

59
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,799
how the whole conversation had began and

60
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:04,038
after hundreds of I'm not interested in

61
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,719
doing that I don't feel like I have to

62
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm afraid I get a lower number and

63
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:08,799
people won't understand that this is

64
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,360
still good medicine it might be

65
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,760
effective for them um mindsets of like

66
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,400
why are you using the equipment you're

67
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,159
using how do you interpret these results

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,800
this makes it more complicated for me to

69
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,759
make my sale to patients I'm not sure I

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,200
want to do that there's literally a risk

71
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,439
of holding the bag that can be

72
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,439
contaminated as a dispensary operator um

73
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,159
others eventually started to Fe here

74
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,120
these guys are around they're very good

75
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,000
they're very professional and had some

76
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
that said you guys are fantastic from

77
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,719
what I hear but until I'm forced to do

78
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,158
it by law or by regulation I'm just not

79
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,439
going to do it I don't feel like paying

80
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:44,479
for that the beginning of 2010 is when

81
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,199
we started uh opening our doors for

82
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,280
service and offered testing to the

83
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,119
industry and in the early part of 2010

84
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,000
there was one other prominent lab Steep

85
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,878
Hill Laboratories that operated up in

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,239
Oakland California northern part of

87
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,759
California they used gas chromatographs

88
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,360
at that time and we were using liquid

89
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:03,679
chromatograph so in 2010 there was very

90
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,879
little bit of an understanding of okay

91
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,040
this stuff may be able to be tested I

92
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:11,280
had a lot of people ask oh you can test

93
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:13,719
this plant I'm like it's still a plant

94
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,519
own dispensary owners um State

95
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:19,080
Regulators other people but I mean even

96
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,280
cultivators patients like you what what

97
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,640
are you going to test what are you

98
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,318
trying to test for how does this testing

99
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,639
really work um in the beginning of 2010

100
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,000
there was definitely a really grave lack

101
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,039
of understanding that you could even

102
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,199
approach this plant and test it in in

103
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,959
some sort of fashion it's still just a

104
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,158
plant like any other plant um the people

105
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,438
that we were interacting with

106
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:41,679
predominantly at that point were mostly

107
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:43,639
dispensary owners operators or managers

108
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,560
of the dispensary so those are the ones

109
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,798
trying to make the financial decisions

110
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,360
understanding what may be best for

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,280
patients how to understand product

112
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,680
quality was certainly of interest if

113
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,640
there's a way I can kind of check the

114
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,480
quality of my cultivators that would be

115
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,559
good patients seem to be very

116
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,238
appreciative of the type of testing that

117
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,719
was being offered at the few places in

118
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,200
Southern California that were doing it

119
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,919
um and that was kind of the idea there

120
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,000
had been just a little bit there if you

121
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,438
if you build it they will come and over

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,239
time you'll be able to educate and

123
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,799
explain why you're doing these things

124
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,400
and how that formalizes this product and

125
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,319
treats it just like every other product

126
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,239
out there so all the eonia all the St

127
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,879
John's wart all the pharmaceutical

128
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:23,159
products your food all of those things

129
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,959
are tested we eventually changed our

130
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,720
pitch to be like you realize your dog's

131
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,000
medicine is tested do you think that

132
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,560
this is you know of lower quality or

133
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,720
people are not is important and you

134
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,399
wouldn't test this type of medicine that

135
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,639
caused a dispensary owner to come right

136
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,279
outside of of his you know little back

137
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,879
office and was like oh was really

138
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,000
interesting I hadn't really thought of

139
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,159
it that way and I'll consider using your

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,600
service they didn't they uh but that you

141
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,080
know kind of at least got the thought

142
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,919
process going and I think that kind of

143
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,079
shows how many people were thinking

144
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,879
about it at the time it was a very

145
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,478
difficult cell I mean it was definitely

146
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,360
days of tens to you know eventually over

147
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,879
a week like I swear we hit a 100 places

148
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,560
and no one wanted to use this service um

149
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,319
but we did find a few and eventually

150
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,680
found a few dispensaries that said I I

151
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,599
really want to demonstrate I am a

152
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,519
legitimate operator I'm a professional

153
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,360
operator I care about the people that

154
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,918
were providing these medicinal products

155
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,919
to and I want to also do what we were

156
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,839
saying like let's formalize these things

157
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,560
let's understand them better and let's

158
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,198
show everybody that this is just another

159
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,720
Botanical product and something that

160
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,160
everyone can benefit from we should

161
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,199
treat it like every other product so a

162
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,240
few dispensaries started to test on a

163
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,478
consistent basis and we asked them you

164
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,400
know would you also do microbiological

165
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:35,038
testing would you do pesticide testing

166
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,799
and they said yeah if you get the

167
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,478
equipment we'll make the commitment to

168
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,680
you you can show up every week and we'll

169
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,918
screen for these types of things too so

170
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,680
the next piece we got was

171
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,198
microbiological testing so we found a a

172
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,959
technology that would allow us to test

173
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,960
for mold in 48 hours and realizing that

174
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,399
turnaround time is exceptionally

175
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,638
important nobody wants to sit on the

176
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,879
products it's important to keep it fresh

177
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,478
you know how do I you know tell somebody

178
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,000
I have to take seven days to do your

179
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,560
testing and get back to you by then it's

180
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,800
all gone and it was pointless you that

181
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,519
was never going to work so 2 days was as

182
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,280
fast as we could find technology to do

183
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,680
it and that seemed to generate enough

184
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,318
interest like all right I can wait a day

185
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,680
or two or I can kind of package it get

186
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,319
it ready while you guys are going and

187
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,598
then we can put it on to um you know

188
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,400
onto the shelf so I think that was you

189
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:23,879
know a big piece in our development The

190
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,638
Next Step was Where Do We Go From Here

191
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,399
canabo profiling was first

192
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,240
microbiological testing was second along

193
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,719
that we went to a couple trade shows and

194
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,120
we found um we put up our here's the

195
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,759
label that we think should be there we

196
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,680
have a little logo that says we were the

197
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,080
ones that tested it you can trust the

198
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,038
numbers were done in an accurate fashion

199
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,560
um a little bit of the Integrity that

200
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:44,719
goes with that is the people behind

201
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,280
doing the testing and what their

202
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,919
certification program would mean how

203
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,758
we're doing this so this is on display

204
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:53,439
to the consumer and then eventually

205
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,160
consumers say oh it's yeah you know

206
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,279
Workshop tested I trust you know seen

207
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,960
them testing other stuff so we put that

208
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,000
there for consumers so they could

209
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,799
understand we advertised that at trade

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,439
shows for dispensary owners other

211
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,240
producers cultivators could then say Oh

212
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,478
wait I can take my stuff to the

213
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,079
dispensary so that they already know

214
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,560
I've done that type of responsible

215
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,519
portion that actually gives me a way of

216
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,399
you know marketing myself and saying I'm

217
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,598
a responsible operator I've checked

218
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,159
these things this lab has verified my

219
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:25,279
work product for this you know this

220
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,919
Harvest you it made their conversations

221
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,318
I think easier with dispensaries at

222
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:29,639
least the first round did now if you

223
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,759
come back and your numbers are very

224
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,240
different the second time uhoh okay I

225
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,160
think I'm done with that testing thing

226
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,400
I'll just tell everybody that I'm always

227
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,000
this good that's great right and that

228
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,598
was why we use tested on dates so I mean

229
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,279
we've seen that in other markets but we

230
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,158
thought that's the only way to say when

231
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,598
were these numbers you know acquired

232
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:50,240
when might they be able to change if

233
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:51,918
they're stored over longer periods of

234
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,840
time how might the product be slightly

235
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,560
different from that or was this some

236
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,598
sort of test that can't be valid because

237
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,680
it was done two years ago on an edible

238
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,319
product that's obviously being

239
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,959
manufactured more frequently than that

240
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,158
um that was one of the elements that we

241
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,839
had added and at this trade show we had

242
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:08,759
our our label up there and another

243
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:10,239
individual came up and said I'd be

244
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,319
really interested in investing in your

245
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,759
business I see that this is where things

246
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,800
should actually go and where they should

247
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,479
head in the end you seem like very

248
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,079
responsible group of individuals

249
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,839
professional I don't see anything else

250
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,758
like this out here let's talk further um

251
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,679
and fortunately that did lead to the

252
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,840
next step in our development after

253
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,079
months of convincing him and his family

254
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,079
that this was a very good decision

255
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,360
um that he said okay I'll take the risk

256
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,519
and give you guys a little bit more

257
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,440
money that allowed us to acquire

258
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,599
pesticide testing and tpine profiling uh

259
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,440
and along with that we were able to uh

260
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,480
bring in the house a Dutch scientist

261
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,920
wonderful individual named CA elzinga

262
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,759
who actually had eight years of

263
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,319
experience in the the Dutch national

264
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,519
system and his uh Graduate Studies he

265
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,160
really understood things we had spoke

266
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,519
and met each other at a conference

267
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:59,360
together down in lagona woods and

268
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,879
immediately the two of us were like you

269
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,560
know oh my goodness you understand the

270
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,320
bigger words I'm saying you understand

271
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,559
the technical complexities of what we're

272
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,800
doing let's go have dinner let's talk

273
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,639
about what we could do together um and I

274
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,639
was able to formalize his position with

275
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,000
us upon securing the other investment

276
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,600
which was about a year after we had

277
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,679
gotten started that led to what I think

278
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,720
we're known for a lot today which is

279
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,278
tarpine profiling and looking at all the

280
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,079
other products that are present in

281
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:27,559
cannabis most people say it's just

282
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:28,919
canabo THC or CBD now um most people

283
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:31,759
don't even know what CBD was when we

284
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,519
first started testing so that was the

285
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,439
goal showing people the other molecules

286
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,159
that are present starting to breed in

287
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,680
different directions Labs will enable

288
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,199
that and start to drift away from only

289
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,679
THC or only one type of use of the plant

290
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,720
if you can breed it for that you have to

291
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,799
be able to breed it for other things

292
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,519
when we first started testing for tpin

293
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,519
the rationale and reason was you could

294
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,919
see I test three different products they

295
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,560
all smell different they look very

296
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,799
different physiologically feel different

297
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,919
but they have the same exact tht number

298
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,199
they have the same exact canab profile I

299
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,000
don't see anything different on my

300
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,920
machine yet I know they're very very

301
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,559
different so I have to start looking at

302
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,639
other molecules and other things to

303
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,518
start to see what these differences are

304
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,000
when we first offered tpine testing

305
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,120
other labs said they're trying to just

306
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,639
charge you for another test I can't see

307
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,159
where there's any value and that they

308
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,600
just want to get more money from the

309
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,519
dispensary guys today everyone's like oh

310
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,800
I offer tpine testing we're trying to do

311
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,000
more of those things you see TP

312
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,120
festivals now there are you know that's

313
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,120
a very big trendy word on social media

314
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,120
media and all sorts of Sling terms

315
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,720
around it now and most people didn't

316
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,879
even know what a tpine was when we

317
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,639
started doing that still today A lot of

318
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,838
people are like tpin I haven't heard of

319
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,639
those um and you have to educate them

320
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,160
about it's related to the smell the

321
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,000
aroma but really causes the

322
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,679
physiological effects that make cannabis

323
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,679
unique that has been you know a big part

324
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:53,958
of what we've been working on that

325
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:55,559
started back in 2011 um so we got

326
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,319
different equipment we were able to

327
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,278
continue to bootstrap we got a couple

328
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,639
other clients that said you offer

329
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,360
broader testing um the clients we did

330
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,600
have and started with they wanted to do

331
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,079
more testing so we became a little bit

332
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,759
more efficient getting the same number

333
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,239
of samples but being able to do more

334
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,360
tests and get more dollar value for that

335
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,959
driving around Southern California for

336
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,680
50,000 mil a year uh to go anywhere and

337
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:20,599
everywhere whether it was Palm Springs

338
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,078
Bakersfield San Diego you know we live

339
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,920
in Pasadena or Los Angeles all those

340
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:26,838
places are quite a ways away from where

341
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,639
we're at every week we were going to

342
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,040
those places to hand select samples and

343
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,360
make sure that they were collected

344
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:35,278
properly and building up our reputation

345
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,440
for being um responsible that allowed a

346
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,278
lot of discussion and a lot of

347
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,519
interaction so it really was a good

348
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,278
thing for us and the community we could

349
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:43,919
explain last week's results we could

350
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:45,639
explain what else was going on we could

351
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,958
answer technical questions while we were

352
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,639
there and started to then also offer

353
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,719
educational seminars if people were

354
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,440
testing I would show up and give them a

355
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,560
little PowerPoint presentation to the

356
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,839
staff so that they could understand some

357
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,199
asked if we would do it for their

358
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,079
patients and certainly we would um um

359
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,759
and I recognized we really have to get

360
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,319
out there more so and start talking to

361
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,399
more and more people so in addition to

362
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,440
talking to dispensary operators

363
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,240
cultivators eventually doctors more so

364
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,639
um I made an effort to go out and talk

365
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,799
to State Regulators other types of

366
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,120
individuals and explain how you could do

367
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,879
testing why testing was important and

368
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,639
where we really need to see this done in

369
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,159
a a regulatory fashion so that the

370
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,839
supply chain is controlled so upon

371
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:28,439
testing for dispensaries you've got a

372
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,959
couple months of operating time with

373
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,199
them things are going pretty well you're

374
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,399
seeing them on a a weekly basis on a

375
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:36,240
regular basis and the feedback that we

376
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,879
received from that were patients love

377
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,759
the information they're very happy to

378
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:41,838
see that someone has checked the quality

379
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,278
control that they feel better knowing

380
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,800
it's past the microbiological screen

381
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:47,159
knowing that they weren't pesticides

382
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,078
that were screen for that were found

383
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:51,198
inside of the products and really

384
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,638
appreciating some of the the cannaboid

385
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:55,159
numbers when tpine values came in

386
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,278
addition to that and we expanded the

387
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,159
label that was a whole new realm that

388
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,078
they could then look at you know I don't

389
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,639
know if I trust the name but I can at

390
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:04,000
least trust these values if they're on

391
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,240
here and if these are the types of

392
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,958
things that I've used before and I like

393
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,440
then I know as a patient that that's

394
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,278
some sort of product that would work for

395
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,040
me and our our feedback from the

396
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,879
dispensary operators were you know our

397
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,439
patients really really like the testing

398
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,559
they really see the value in this type

399
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,360
of thing um and we're glad that we can

400
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,958
offer it to them it was a huge

401
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,879
competitive Advantage for dispensaries

402
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,879
who opted to offer tested products as

403
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,399
opposed to those who didn't so when you

404
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,159
have a large cluster of them and a very

405
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,879
small area how do you differentiate

406
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,639
yourself how do you offer different

407
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,838
things to the patients and other

408
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,198
information this was a great tool for

409
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,120
that kind of thing and certain

410
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,559
dispensary owners really recognized that

411
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,799
right away some that were um in other

412
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:46,439
areas actually used it posted every

413
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,799
result and said look I even grabbed uh

414
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,040
tested samples from other dispensaries

415
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,639
and they found pesticides in them our

416
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,679
supply chain is clean we're very

417
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,039
diligent it's a very different type of

418
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,758
offering to the consumer or the patient

419
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,240
consumer that wants to understand what

420
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,079
what they're putting in their body who

421
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,639
may be immuno compromised or really

422
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,198
under you know sick or other types of

423
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,919
issues they don't want to ingest

424
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:09,758
anything that could cause harm so

425
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,838
pesticides and molds could be worse we

426
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,320
definitely don't want to do that um and

427
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,959
the feedback was patients really enjoy

428
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,120
the service and really appreciate that

429
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,719
and found it to be very very beneficial

430
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,198
to them so every entrepreneur builds

431
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,399
their business plan with the hockey

432
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,958
stick in mind and it was definitely not

433
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,919
the hockey stick it was a very very slow

434
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:32,078
hard work effort type thing and and more

435
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,958
Grassroots type Word of Mouth gets

436
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,479
around the way that we when we look back

437
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,958
at all of the clients that we've tested

438
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,278
for and the people that we've been doing

439
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,958
business with there are very few that

440
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:43,720
have still continued to test from the

441
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,919
first days that we started so we've got

442
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,079
a couple they started with us and have

443
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,120
tested all the time every single time

444
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,838
and keep doing it there are others who

445
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,679
tried it for a little while then dropped

446
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,279
off and it was a constant effort of

447
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,719
finding new clients constantly going out

448
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:59,559
there to try and build the business but

449
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,920
that really just kept you able to

450
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,479
maintain and sustain it was never really

451
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,479
where that all of a sudden everybody

452
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,600
decided to go ahead and start testing um

453
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,120
we now test we've opened a laboratory in

454
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,079
the state of Washington where it is

455
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,839
mandatory to test for the recreational

456
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,638
market so it's been required to test and

457
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,800
what you see there are there's a couple

458
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,919
Labs that offer services the one who

459
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,679
gives the highest THC value and the ones

460
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,078
who charge the lowest price are the labs

461
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:27,000
that get the best amount of the market

462
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:28,198
so it's not even that all of a sudden

463
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,240
regulations change and you're a

464
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:31,078
successful lab there's all sorts of

465
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,399
other ways that you have to

466
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:35,000
differentiate yourself and it's still

467
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,120
difficult because they're not checking

468
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,799
the scientific Integrity or validity of

469
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,159
all the tests we now have Labs that are

470
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,159
giving Gravely inflated numbers on

471
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:44,879
flowers I won't even repeat the number

472
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:47,719
for fear people think that that's

473
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,879
possible um but it's difficult to say

474
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,720
hey regulator you've certified that

475
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,078
these Labs should operate but you

476
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,920
haven't checked that they do their

477
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:57,078
operations properly there's no

478
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:59,159
proficiency testing there's no you know

479
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:01,479
accuracy checking on what exactly the

480
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:03,559
lab is doing now you've given everybody

481
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,759
this false sense of that's an okay lab

482
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:06,958
but really they're giving them

483
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,399
thisinformation and to me when people

484
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,958
told us as we were building up I don't

485
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,000
want to test I'd rather see you not test

486
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,879
than test wrong and get the wrong values

487
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,278
so if I have Mis leading information on

488
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,720
Doses and I thought I was taking 25

489
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,958
milligrams when really I was only

490
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,920
consuming 10 and the next time I go and

491
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,439
actually get something that's 25 and

492
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,838
that could be very detrimental to the

493
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,920
patient that could be exceptionally

harmful if you told them they never new

495
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,039
they'd probably always start you know at

496
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,079
a slower regime and work their way up

497
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,919
