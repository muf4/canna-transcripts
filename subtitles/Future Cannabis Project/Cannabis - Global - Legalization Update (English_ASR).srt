00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,269
people are suffering but I'm really I'm

5
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:29,479
really proud to say that I've been

6
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:33,238
involved in the legalization and don't

nonetheless a lot of less people are

10
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,579
going to jail yeah well there was our

11
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,929
priority now exactly a regulation or

12
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,939
legalization whatever you want to call

13
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:46,590
it exactly out there now yeah we are

14
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,570
I remember eight years ago and during

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,590
the high times cup I declared the war on

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,009

uh-huh yeah a little-little event a

19
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:02,218
little ahead of your time when

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,040

00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,408
well five percent is gonna say oh yeah

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,060
you're maybe a cool guy because you're

33
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,700
gonna legalize marijuana now you getting

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,019
my vote because you know the Democrats

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,868
didn't do a lot of good things for us

36
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,399
huh no no politician isn't it that Bill

37
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:37,438
Clinton put more people in prison than

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,170
anybody else from marijuana yeah okay

39
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,789
yeah so yeah well what do we say about

40
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,710
that done we're gonna leave the DT name

41
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,920
out of this but let's not go to in

42
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:50,519
politics right right so you know on the

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,250
the global scale of legalization you

44
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,719
know you travel a lot more than I do

45
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,390
what so what can you tell us about the

46
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,859
global legalization seem well if you

47
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,689
look at Europe you know especially

48
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:05,188
Holland it was the leader for many many

49
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:08,758
years I think to take it from there

50
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:11,340
world's biggest economic disaster ever I

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,769
think a country threw away a whole

52
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,030
industry

53
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,070
that could have been leaders worldwide

54
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,379
which are now the Americans and Canadian

55
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:22,739
companies Holland could have could have

56
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,750
been that and we fucked it up so we

57
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,900
threw away a hundred billion dollar

58
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,099
prosperity in the next ten years so and

59
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,140
then the rest of Europe

60
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,639
slowly slowly coming well you know

61
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:34,919
you've been in my clubs in Spain sure

62
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,089
there is there's a little bit movement

63
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,159
there there's a little bit movement in

64
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,050
Italy with CVD shops there's a little

65
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,900
bit moving in Switzerland we're moving

66
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,070
to Africa now as you know we have a

67
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,379
license in the suit that we have a

68
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,840
license in Congo who slowly we're

69
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:51,019
opening up so who opening the boundaries

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,909
in Africa which is a really good thing

71
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,860
as a matter of fact South Africa

72
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:56,939
I'm from Zambia but South Africa just

73
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,070
two weeks ago

74
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:02,219
hi Supreme Court allowed personal use

75
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:04,229
which opens a lot of doors I did hear

76
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,400
something about that is very very good

77
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,489
thing

78
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,950
Portugal Europe also so South America

79
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,400
well South America you know now Chile

80
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:16,530
Colombia giving license

81
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,530
Argentina willing to change who I was

82
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,740
the first one I was one of the personal

83
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,120
advisers of president Mujica as I mean

84
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,360
all of and I could we were there three

85
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,879
times Paraguay Heiko just came from

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,980
Paraguay a month ago Brazil eight

87
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,799
license more license are in the Uruguay

88
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,209
no or ago I was the first one I realize

89
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,850
right now I'm talking about part of what

90
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:43,170
ones yes Paraguay to us and Brazil so

91
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:46,710
look the main thing is what we're

92
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:48,329
waiting for is America has to change on

93
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:51,780
a federal level yes

94
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,990
Canada did America is going to go yes we

95
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,939
will I think 2020 hope hopefully at

96
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:02,040
least that there will be a letter from

97
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:04,079
the from the government declaring all

98
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,849
states do whatever they want also on a

99
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,850
recreational level which means that

100
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,799
banks and other important assets for us

101
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,239
can come into the industry scheduling

102
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,360
these scheduling will happen and that

103
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,730
will make that will make the rest of the

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,949
world change a little bit faster that's

105
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,879
what we are waiting for I think I mean

106
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,089
that's what that's what it's all been

107
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,279
about for me is

108
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:27,000
the normalization and the legalization

109
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:29,739
of cannabis use I moved to California

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,600
about 17 years ago for the sole reason

111
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,490
of not being a criminal for the first

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,730
time in my life I remember the reason

113
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,019
why I moved to question 25 years ago why

114
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:43,020
don't you go there where it's easy you

115
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:46,120
remember you know I made it happen and

116
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:48,310
so California is a lovely place on those

117
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,430
on fire right now

118
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,370
I wish prayers to everybody that's vacu

119
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,050
ate their homes and such but that's why

120
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,370
we've been alban here and that's why i'm

121
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,870
i can say that i'm proud to be your

122
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:03,490
friend because we we've always

123
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,649
championed the legalization yeah and the

124
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,639
normalization of cannabis use we're not

125
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:07,388
criminals we're no different from

126
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,100
anybody else

127
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,168
in fact you people are all crazy if you

128
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,510
don't want to try a little cannabis well

129
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:15,639
you know my we've been very big

130
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,560
activists you know we've been i've been

131
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,960
15 years chairman of the cannabis retail

132
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,879
Association Holland I advise still

133
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,250
mayors you're him our partner you know

134
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,110
you're very well he's still advising the

135
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,810
government we change the law in Dutch

136
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,250
parliament last year together with one

137
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,780
political party it went through the

138
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,899
second Parliament which is really really

139
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:37,418
good I think it's our duty as a human

140
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:40,000
being and to be in the forefront with

141
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:41,889
all our knowledge and to be an activist

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,649
and to help legalize and for many many

143
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:46,719
reasons and for most important reason is

144
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:49,689
decriminalization and health I think

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,070
within 10 to 20 years we will all be

146
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:56,560
eating oil and it will prevent us

147
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:59,740
getting sick in 80% of the cases sure

148
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,180
you know we know now this oil is a great

149
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:07,329
product we know it stops in some cases

150
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,560
the dividing of aggressive cells that's

151
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:12,759
right of cancer cells

152
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:16,300
well yeah whatever so and it's a very

153
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,099
good kind of antioxidant for the body

154
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,680
and that's just the medicinal properties

155
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,539
of cannabis and then you get into the

156
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,620
the hemp seed itself go get into the

157
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:25,509
hemp seed itself which is a great

158
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,949
foodstuff yeah we're all we're all

159
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:33,039
lacking in DFAS

160
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:35,240
and so you know legalization and

161
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,370
spreading it around the world has been a

162
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,949
privilege and an honor for myself and

163
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,050
getting to know you as young bucks as we

164
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,519
were and now I look at you you're not

165
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,980
even great yet what's wrong with you I

166
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:49,189
