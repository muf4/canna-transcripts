2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,718
so it's now 2015 and today fortunately

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,799
we see a number of states that require

4
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:15,798
testing it is mandatory all the hard

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,160
work in talking to State regulators and

6
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:20,000
other lawmakers that they've required

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,000
this element inside of the new programs

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,559
that have come about um but

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,198
unfortunately it's still frustrating

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:27,960
from the lab perspective being mandatory

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,480
and required has brought other types of

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,200
players into the space but no one has

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,200
certified that they actually do their

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,960
scientific process the right way that

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,480
they're getting accurate reproducible

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,399
and valid numbers and the frustration is

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,640
I have a bunch of unsophisticated people

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,280
who thought being a lab was a great idea

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,920
from a business s stance it certainly is

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,000
but technically it's exceptionally

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,160
complex it takes a great deal of uh

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,558
scientific Acumen to run this type of

23
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:55,599
process the right way to make sure your

24
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,198
uh tests are accurate valid and it

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,320
requires a certain amount of cost to do

26
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,280
that in the best possible fashion the

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,799
frustration that we have is that other

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,680
labs who don't understand those

29
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,079
scientific uh principles or cutting

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,520
Corners are happy to give High values

31
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,798
for cannaboid Content passing all the

32
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:14,478
mold and microbiological contaminations

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,840
have never found one in their you know

34
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,519
existence they're gaining market share

35
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,799
and having all the clients go towards

36
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,560
them because they know that they're

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,280
going to get a big number and be tested

38
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,799
and be passed they're never going to

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,118
have to reject their lot they're never

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,759
going to find out what's actually there

41
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,879
that's exceptionally frustrating so we

42
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,319
are working with regul especially in

43
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,478
Washington to form proficiency testing

44
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,879
protocols Colorado has also added that

45
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:39,280
to their regulations at my insistence we

46
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,879
have to be able to say these labs are

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,280
doing the right job or it's really

48
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,839
pointless you're just paying someone to

49
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,239
do something and give you a false sense

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,240
of security an inaccurate number no one

51
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,280
should pay for any of that in my opinion

52
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,239
so we have to continue to to work hard

53
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,920
and and really demonstrate that there's

54
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,519
the right way to do this and I think

55
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,719
through that the quality will continue

56
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,560
to improve it's always difficult to be

57
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:01,438
the ones at the very top but we're

58
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,840
trying to bring everyone else up to that

59
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,879
same level and make sure all the labs

60
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,880
are operating at the the utmost highest

61
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,879
regard

62
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:11,310
