2
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:13,789
when we're looking at product out here a

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,039
little disappointed on the concentrates

4
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:19,528
especially when it comes to cartridges I

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,270
don't think a person should be paying

6
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:23,698
over 40 dollars for a good cartridge

7
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,500
when I say good cartridge there

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,140
shouldn't be any propylene glycol in it

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,750
MCT oil any other additives that could

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,210
be harmful to the consumer as well and

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,488
then also flavor additives which is very

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,340
interesting so I noticed that a lot of

13
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,799
companies out here are using way too

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,750
many what we call naturally drive

15
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,549
terpenes so they're buying terpenes from

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,480
various companies whether it's in Oregon

17
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:50,250
California other states and it just it

18
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,509
doesn't give the user a good experience

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,780
it doesn't taste like a particular

20
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:56,339
strain it's very strange and I don't

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,079
think these companies and I don't think

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,059
these bud tenders that are selling these

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,710
products are also educated on what's

24
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,890
actually going into these products as

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,599
well so that's where we come in so we

26
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,659
actually create a lot of cartridges in

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,489
California I'm sorry Colorado we have a

28
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,950
very efficient process we're using

29
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:17,368
distillate cannabis derived terpenes

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,549
very good flavor flavor profile good

31
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,290
potency and ultimately affordable and I

32
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,900
think this the portability aspect that's

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,759
going to help change that market shift

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,590
from the illicit market again to the

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,819
regulated market so it's fairly insane

36
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,549
why I'm seeing cartridges good

37
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:35,929
cartridges that are over $50 seeing live

38
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:39,450
resin that's $100 plus right

39
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,490
pre-tax exactly and so you know you add

40
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,649
37 percent tax on that I mean that's

41
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:46,709
insane so the average Joe out here

42
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,629
cannot afford concentrates and I think

43
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:50,759
that's the way that the industry is

44
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:53,368
moving when you look at market analytics

45
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,890
for example you see a lot of people

46
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:57,959
that's reverting to more infused

47
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,269
products and concentrate over flower'

48
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:03,179
I think the days of just combusting

49
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:05,188
flour are coming to an end now that said

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,219
I think California has incredible flour

51
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:11,489
out here similar to Colorado I think you

52
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,710
have a lot of bad product but when you

53
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,230
go to those select dispensaries right

54
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,849
it you can find some really really good

55
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:20,939
stuff again just similar to Colorado

56
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,829
it's kind of roll the dice so again

57
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,300
we're barely excited to come out here

58
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,969
hopefully we'll be open in about ten

59
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,370
months or so and again bring those

60
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:31,919
high-quality concentrates basically to

61
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:41,969
the average Joe and really expand that

62
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:45,750
concentrate market so Sacramento what we

63
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:48,530
noticed and and kind of parallel to our

64
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,889
brand is we really want just like hard

65
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:54,780
everyday people just working for us

66
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:57,509
Sacramento also seems to really want

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,819
cannabis business dollars very business

68
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:02,750
friendly unlike other cities within

69
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,430
California and those are the type of

70
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:15,810
municipal allies that we try to align

71
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:18,689
ourselves with right right so we didn't

72
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,590
think that LA was super cannabis

73
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:25,259
friendly especially with the high taxes

74
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,930
also with the application process out

75
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,819
here as well same thing with San

76
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,120
Francisco and we also thought that

77
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,459
Sacramento was kind of just a good

78
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,409
midpoint where again we can do some

79
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:41,010
pretty heavy distribution just across

80
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:43,109
the state as well so where do you plan

81
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,939
on sort because you're you're doing an

82
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,480
extraction seeing the source flower

83
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:50,599
where you plan to source from that's a

84
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,939
good question so we are looking for

85
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:56,419
partners for that as we speak and what

86
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,419
kind of

87
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,139
greenhouse you wanted from a certain

88
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,658
region or appellation yeah it's a good

89
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,958
question so I think off the bat when we

90
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:08,068
first start our our production I think

91
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,709
we're going to be focusing more on

92
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:12,179
cartridges with that since we do go

93
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,939
through a distillate process we don't

94
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,750
necessarily need the most incredible

95
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,738
expensive flower to extract since we are

96
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,689
you know kind of stripping all the

97
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,379
terpenes off and other things like that

98
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:24,240
right

99
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,029
so I think we'd probably be looking more

100
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,050
for like greenhouse to begin with maybe

101
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:34,379
outdoor we do have some specially

102
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,720
trained raw material acquisition folks

103
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:39,810
who do go to these cultivations

104
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,810
who do study their processes look at

105
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,850
their quality of flower with that - we

106
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,430
want to make sure that these companies

107
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,979
that are providing us raw material are

108
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,500
doing not just the minimum testing but

109
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,959
making sure that they're even going

110
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,899
above and beyond so again we're looking

111
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,478
for you know specific pesticides we're

112
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:03,449
looking for a specific microbial content

113
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,639
for instance in California total yeast

114
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:08,250
and mold isn't tested so we want to make

115
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,460
sure that that is above or I should say

116
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,259
below a certain threshold so tripping

117
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,180
profiles all that different stuff again

118
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,250
we want to make sure that we're we're

119
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,668
venting those raw material partners

120
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,668
correctly

121
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,689
that is correct yeah okay and so what

122
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:31,319
are they looking for like when they go

123
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:34,980
to basically buy biomass right yep

124
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,230
shrimp yeah what are they when you just

125
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,750
mentioned like what if things they don't

126
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,270
want yeah so I think a lot of things

127
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,250
you're looking at is what's going into

128
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:46,469
that fire to begin with so when we're

129
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,389
looking at agricultural chemicals such

130
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,540
as like fertilizers and even pesticides

131
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,819
as well we know that certain fertilizers

132
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,439
have a lot of heavy metals in it when

133
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,399
you're looking at a concentrate company

134
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:01,620
if you're using a very clean low metal

135
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,729
fertilizers for example that translates

136
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,949
into the concentrate you're gonna have a

137
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,870
very good flavorful concentrate versus

138
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,629
we have a lot of cultivations out there

139
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,389
that are using you know pretty common

140
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:14,490
agricultural chemicals and we noticed

141
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:17,339
that those don't translate super well

142
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,920
when those things get extracted so we

143
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:22,829
want to make sure that there's clean

144
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:27,150
chemicals going into that plant as

145
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:48,750
naturally as possible and so having into

146
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:51,209
a clean extract so I'm not one of those

147
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,370
acquisitions people I would have to ask

148
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:55,019
them what that California market is

149
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,629
looking like I imagine that it's it's

150
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:59,219
quite more expensive in Colorado

151
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:01,589
Colorado what we're seeing on a

152
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,860
wholesale price for trim we're seeing

153
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:12,589
probably an average between $150 to $200

154
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:12,590
a pound for trim for like yep exactly

155
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:19,140
it's down so right now in Colorado

156
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,660
there's an extreme price war occurring a

157
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:24,389
race to the bottom is how it's been for

158
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,820
the past two to three years that we are

159
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,669
still seeing a pretty level market

160
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,980
unlike Oregon for example where they

161
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,170
actually have a huge surplus of product

162
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,780
that's just been hanging out Colorado

163
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,480
actually has done a very good job

164
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,819
regulating the caller

165
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,680
Colorado market in the sense where we're

166
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,629
balancing that market where we don't

167
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,879
have this giant surplus and we actually

168
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,189
don't have that shortage either and I

169
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,139
think with outdoor cultivations in

170
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:52,180
greenhouse in Colorado it's just been

171
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,399
making that process a bit more efficient

172
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,439
so again that's kind of driving down

173
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,479
those prices a little bit and making

174
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:02,319
product ultimately more affordable for

175
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:06,850
the consumer with your product portfolio

176
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:10,329
of extracted products what's popping

177
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:13,870
like what's what's new and getting hot

178
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:17,109
what's kind of I mean you have like beat

179
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:20,319
tanks resin you have like bras in you

180
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:22,210
have all these different products what

181
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,099
for you guys is kind of trending up in

182
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:27,849
there yeah so what we're seeing right

183
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:30,910
now in Colorado is definitely high

184
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:34,120
quality affordable vape cartridges is by

185
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,060
far the most popular product not only

186
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,549
for residents who live there but also

187
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,289
for tourists or visiting Colorado relies

188
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:43,539
a lot on tourist dollars we obviously

189
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,789
have some of the best skiing in the

190
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,149
country of course we have a lot of

191
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:51,759
people come to Denver stuff like that

192
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:52,209
that's that's right that's right that's

193
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,360
right

194
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:57,220
and so and especially like the music

195
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,110
scene over there you know if you go to

196
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,730
Red Rocks in Colorado you're seeing a

197
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,080
lot of people use their vape pens you're

198
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,789
seeing a lot of people using their vape

199
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,200
pens on the slope a lot of people use

200
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:07,990
them at home too it's just very easy

201
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,629
there's a lot of people who out there

202
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,879
who are a little hesitant of you know

203
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:16,269
taking a DAB and using a torch or

204
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:21,149
turning on an email people just like the

205
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:24,250
ease of that high quality vape cartridge

206
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:25,289
and with your big cartridges what

207
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,360
company

208
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:29,360
sourcing from what did you pick as a

209
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:34,578
that is a good that is a good question

210
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,659
we actually have our own suppliers

211
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:39,059
actually out in China where we actually

212
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,469
custom make a lot of our materials

213
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:43,349
because we noticed that a lot of

214
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,810
suppliers in China don't have the best

215
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,670
products especially when it comes to

216
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:52,018
product safety and stuff like that so we

217
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:54,689
actually have very very we have one

218
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:58,620
partner in particular and again in China

219
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,360
who is making a lot of custom vaping

220
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,818
cartridges and actually a lot of custom

221
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,149
packaging for us as well and it's so

222
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:08,189
important to vent your clientele in

223
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:09,809
China because I think anyone over there

224
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,699
is going to try to sell you anything and

225
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,198
again one of our main concerns is

226
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:15,240
definitely public health and safety

227
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:17,399
it's definitely not in our interest to

228
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,480
get any of our clientele sick right we

229
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:28,409
want to make sure that they're having a

230
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:30,389
very good safe experience different

231
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:31,769
companies that manufacture them

232
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:34,409
differently which would have different

233
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:38,610
levels of safety issues right and it

234
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:40,769
seems like so what from what you noticed

235
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,600
in the market of big tanks not

236
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,799
specifically what you're using it but

237
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,440
like what are some of the health risk

238
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:52,439
components of that hardware yeah you

239
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,589
could get clean oil and it goes into

240
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,839
these bags yeah and they don't test you

241
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,209
know they test before it goes in right

242
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,819
so yeah I know it's clean it's safe and

243
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:05,608
then someone's inhaling heavy metals

244
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:09,208
so what are the components that you guys

245
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:13,489
have noticed that are the leading causes

246
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:15,748
of potential when we look at a lot of

247
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:18,509
current studies and of course this needs

248
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:20,189
to be studied way more than it is and

249
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:22,709
we're actually very much looking forward

250
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:25,019
to hopefully some more legitimate

251
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:27,258
studies coming out but what we're seeing

252
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,899
is definitely like non ceramic based

253
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:32,278
vaporizer cartridges do have actually

254
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,019
quite a bit of heavy metals when that

255
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,568
oil is in there

256
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:39,629
and additionally again we still don't

257
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:42,358
even know even how that translates

258
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:43,949
versus you know when you do inhale from

259
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:46,139
that cartridge how much of that heavy

260
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:48,628
metal is actually coming out how does

261
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:50,399
heating it impact that heavy metal

262
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:52,649
intake as well right there's just so

263
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:58,038
much things that we don't know and we

264
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:58,038
always want to be on the air of caution
