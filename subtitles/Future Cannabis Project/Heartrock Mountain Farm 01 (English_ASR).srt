1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,398
uh my name is uh daniel morford and

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,638
we're at hart rock mountain farm

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,719
um this is where i grew up this is where

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,480
i was actually born

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,399
and we're just gonna be doing some

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,560
filming this season to kind of introduce

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
you to different stages of the farm

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,879
we're working with future cannabis

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,880
projects and pride of the lion seeds

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
and

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,079
it's beginning april now and the cover

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,359
crop is blooming and our nursery is

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,719
going along and we're just going to do a

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,920
little walk through

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,160
of our farm

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,120
and we're going to start over here

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,119
with some nice hugo cultures

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,719
so right behind me we have

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,320
hidden somewhere in the mustard and

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,000
radish

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,719
280 feet of huge cultures

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,280
when we buried logs two foot deep and

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,120
three foot trenches and piled up

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,120
logs and branches five feet high and

25
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,359
covering them with soil

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,399
so these are three years old this year

27
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,879
and

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,680
it's an exciting year because year three

29
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,000
you get a nice terpene spike

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,520
i mean since we've gone no till like

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,478
everything's been increasing in

32
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,158
uh

33
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,679
terpenes every year and i guess that you

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,520
know goes along like since we got our

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,880
dragonfly earth medicine certification

36
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,039
the same strains every year have been

37
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,519
going up you know most of our stuff

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,799
testing around three percent terpenes

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,560
i'm excited for for this uh to

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
to see if those trends keep keep

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,960
climbing

42
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,719
we have like artichokes we have comfrey

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,040
we have a

44
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,078
variety of cover crop

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,840
you can see some fava beans here which a

46
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,839
nitrogen fixer

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,439
um

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,520
and we're just gonna find a little place

49
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,279
here and take a peek

50
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,959
i mean it's been so dry it's hardly

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
raining

52
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,438
too much

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,439
past couple months

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,920
yeah

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
soil's so dry

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
it's amazing the mustard's

57
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
kind of carried on here

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,000
but it will be

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,080
chopping and dropping and composting

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,680
right after to fix as much of this

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,680
nutrients as possible you can see the

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
honeybees are really going for this

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,239
we have some nice poppies coming up in

64
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,238
the road

65
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,359
and we'll go up plum tree

66
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:47,159
we got some little rosemary bushes

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,160
planted in front of here

68
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,280
on this side of our farm here we call um

69
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,679
plum tree path

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,598
this gets like the late season sun so

71
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,080
this is where we'll probably be growing

72
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:05,679
the uh original haze this year it's

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,040
where we grow like the swazi gold

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,120
i think we might be growing some of the

75
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,039
healer one to one from dragonfly earth

76
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,039
medicine

77
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,039
and

78
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,759
and this is our big field here these

79
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,519
plants are on

80
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,280
15 foot centers and you can see the

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,439
stalks of the sunflowers from last year

82
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,120
and those are kind of marking our

83
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,400
our flower belts

84
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,439
that we will

85
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,120
uh

86
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,120
be seeding with flowers and veggies

87
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,840
and this is where we'll grow the big

88
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,840
girls

89
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,318
here's one of the potatoes we planted a

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,040
few weeks ago

91
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,158
we uh we seeded the whole farm this year

92
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,079
with

93
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,318
potatoes so

94
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,159
in the next couple years we'll have

95
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,399
hundreds of pounds of potatoes in the

96
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,798
bank i mean if there's a rodent they'll

97
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,170
go for a potato over cannabis roots or

98
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,519
stocks

99
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:07,839
[Music]

100
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,280
but it's just the easy

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,959
companion

102
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
plant and in this climate when you

103
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,920
harvest the potatoes you can just

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,438
scatter them right there in the fall you

105
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,519
don't have to wait till after the winter

106
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,519
because it doesn't get cold enough to

107
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,959
this is a uh

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,479
uh

109
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,638
yellow dock

110
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,560
this is good it brings up uh

111
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,319
high-end trace minerals

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,319
it's native here

113
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,800
this is holly hawk behind it which is a

114
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,120
good pollinator friendly plant like

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,918
beneficials native pollinators and

116
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,918
honeybees like the hollyhocks

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,600
i always like to see you know

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,680
what

119
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,519
flowers are attracting what pollinators

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
and you know trying to grow a diversity

121
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:01,359
of flowers and stuff that'll

122
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,478
that bloom more or less year round and

123
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,160
and seeing what's going on

124
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:09,120
but yeah my dad bought this place in

125
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,120
1976

126
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,080
or 77 something like that

127
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,199
it's almost hard to see the shape of the

128
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,279
farm with how high the cover crop is but

129
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
you know this road we plant all the

130
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,198
wraps away all the all the way around

131
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,038
these are terraces here that we built

132
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,280
which was really fun we had a log deck

133
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,719
up there and just cut and rolled logs

134
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,519
down a couple of us and got them in

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,880
place

136
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,038
definitely have some videos of some of

137
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,038
that

138
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,680
here's another set of terraces and these

139
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,120
are probably some of the smaller spacing

140
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,478
on the farm i think these are like six

141
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,639
foot spacing

142
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,038
most things 10 to 12 foot spacing just

143
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,960
to give us the room for airflow

144
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:50,639
for the polyculture potential around it

145
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,839
and then here we got the the two

146
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,319
sentinel doug fir trees watching over

147
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,319
the farm

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,840
and this is sunset garden

149
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,359
and this is this is more of a of a

150
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,000
spiral garden

151
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,080
you know starting here on kuan yin the

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,680
it does like two spirals of cannabis

153
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:25,918
planting and it's got a lot of diversity

154
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,360
that's hidden under this cover crop

155
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,439
we have some

156
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,280
some grapes a lot of different varieties

157
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:37,038
of flowers and yarrows and

158
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,839
uh we have some young guava trees

159
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,680
which

160
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,679
oh and here's a nice pollinator

161
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,839
you see these blue flowers that are

162
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,759
opening up here

163
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,519
it's uh although there's like eight

164
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,240
plants called this is what nicknamed

165
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,478
bee's friend i forget this actual name

166
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,478
um

167
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,439
and they're

168
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,319
a wildflower that we sewed that just

169
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:07,759
keeps coming back which is nice

170
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,759
it's a nice little patch of them

171
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:15,759
i see some beneficial insects i see

172
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,240
over hover flies

173
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,080
honeybees there's at least

174
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,720
three different types of pollinators on

175
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,359
these right now

176
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,479
now we are crossing the threshold

177
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
of the

178
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,839
expansion that i've done to the original

179
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,000
heart rock orchard founded or as my dad

180
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:38,318
calls it the homestead orchard

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,319
so my dad planted that jonathan tree

182
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,399
and those two fig trees

183
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:43,598
and the road used to come up through

184
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,758
here where the apple tree is i've

185
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,319
planted the the younger fruit trees are

186
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
mostly planted by me

187
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,240
and

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,918
here under the cover crop there's about

189
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,038
40 plots

190
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:59,359
and i think we'll be doing the um

191
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,519
autoflower hybrid seed production here

192
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,759
if we're successful we'll be making

193
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,758
120 new flavors of autoflowers

194
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,038
yeah this this yellow delicious also has

195
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,800
all kinds of

196
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:17,519
there's some beetles on it there's a

197
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,520
couple types of winged insects honeybees

198
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,639
that literally looks nice there's a

199
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,638
bumblebee too

200
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,839
and then we have a celestial fig tree

201
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,439
over here

202
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,519
and actually some of my older brothers

203
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,000
ashes are buried under that celestial

204
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,000
fig tree

205
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,439
yeah and then wild elderberry here

206
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,679
behind us

207
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,880
an apple tree behind that

208
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,879
more apple trees and

209
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,360
and of course this is not as open as it

210
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,040
was when like my father was farming here

211
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,039
like here where these fruit trees are

212
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,719
and the raspberries and the apple trees

213
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,719
was all kind of coyote brush with a

214
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,759
little bit of raspberries and up where

215
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,680
those nursery hoops are it's more

216
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,919
that was also kind of brushed and thinly

217
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,479
open space

218
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,479
i think the

219
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,759
before we converted this upper part of

220
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,440
it to uh nursery i think the original

221
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,439
homestead garden

222
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,200
you know could affect like

223
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,240
75 well

224
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,240
spaced big plants

225
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,560
here's our main propagation hoop

226
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:29,679
and this is just the style that we do we

227
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,599
start in four inch pots

228
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,679
[Music]

229
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,360
these over here will get up potted into

230
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,799
one gallons

231
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,959
we have begun the phase to up pot from

232
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,599
one gallons into five gallons five

233
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,599
gallons into the ground

234
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,159
here's those uh original haze look at

235
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:00,079
the various thin leaves on those

236
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,399
and at our elevation here

237
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,800
we are in a slight banana belt for the

238
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,958
region you know if you go up 500 feet or

239
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:10,240
down 500 feet you have to deal with like

240
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,919
earlier frosts in the fall later frost

241
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
in the spring

242
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:19,078
you know we should be able to pull those

243
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,079
november hazes in no problem

244
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,240
then we've got a hoop house full of one

245
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,240
gallons to go up

246
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,799
and then you know now we can do a little

247
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:38,159
loop oh yeah we can shut then we got the

248
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,159
ones getting into five gallons

249
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,600
i just want to point out that that

250
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,159
where that apple tree is behind me is

251
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,920
approximately where my mom's water broke

252
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,039
and i was born just

253
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,039
up there in the old cabin site

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,559
and this slope is going to be fun to

255
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,040
watch

256
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,599
unfold this year we've grown autoflowers

257
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,039
here in the past but we've we've decided

258
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,639
that

259
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,599
this is just going to be a pollinator

260
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,720
garden

261
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,800
so

262
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,440
you know every two foot on this hillside

263
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,039
behind me are plots that are been sewed

264
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,560
with

265
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,958
flower seeds and they are starting to

266
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,958
come up

267
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,000
so that's going to be fun to watch

268
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,000
this unfold

269
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,399
this little section here we called you

270
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,480
know middle earth i originally put in

271
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,000
this flat to build a barn

272
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,639
but um

273
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,799
we added it into the square footage

274
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,120
and we're gonna put a barn in a shady

275
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,120
spot

276
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,120
here we have some parsnips growing from

277
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,399
uh golden figs gardens and cobalt gave

278
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,480
us the seeds we've got a few of them

279
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,159
scattered throughout the farm

280
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,639
that's another really easy plant to

281
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,559
propagate that's like

282
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,240
just a good food bank to like bank the

283
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,919
farm it's actually one of the more tasty

284
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,959
root vegetables like baked or fried

285
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,958
parsnips are amazing

286
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,720
and then the road down below us here

287
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,519
with

288
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,560
uh

289
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,720
we have

290
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,879
i think 13 or 14 varieties of apple

291
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,160
trees that we will grow ganja where the

292
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,120
mustard is

293
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:24,799
and we have our autoflower soap slopes

294
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,440
that are being prepped to be planted

295
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:30,000
and you can get a shot there

296
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,440
of the auto slope

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,120
and then

298
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,519
that road wraps around to the front

299
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,519
where we started

300
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,278
yeah we'll start making some pathways

301
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,760
here before the snakes come out

302
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:47,759
hopefully

303
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,399
and then here we are back there's the

304
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,240
hugelkultur's is the main field

305
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,919
and then we have another garden down

306
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,919
below the house so we start at like 2

307
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:02,159
300 feet and go all the way up to like 2

308
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:04,639
400 feet a high garden up there is a uh

309
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,240
there's a nursery pattern and

310
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,200
we'll be filming up there later when

311
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,360
there's

312
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,600
something to see it's just mustard right

313
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,600
now

314
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,799
and that's one of the best things about

315
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,839
this office space it's just

316
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,838
the sound of the wind in the trees

317
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,399
well thanks for joining me today on a

318
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,759
little farm tour and i look forward to

future cannabis project is carrying our

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,559
genetics

324
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,439
planters of the trees is carrying our

325
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:52,719
genetics pacific north roots

326
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,720
is carrying our genetics

327
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,040
seed cellar

328
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,000
is carrying our genetics

329
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,278
and

330
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,720

when you cultivate love

339
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,159
love grows

340
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,959
and where love grows

341
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,958
so does everything else
