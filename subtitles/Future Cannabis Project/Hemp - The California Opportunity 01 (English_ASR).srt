[Music]

2
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:23,070
next topic we're going to dive into is

3
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,470
industrial hemp particularly what is the

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,768
opportunity for hemp in California right

5
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:31,320
now as most of you know farming

6
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,719
regulations are not quite complete and

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,058
the forms aren't out yet but there are

8
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,189
several startups and established

9
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:41,399
companies that are moving back they're

10
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:44,099
moving into the state or welling up from

11
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,049
the ground Springs to make their

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,239
presence known in the hemp industry here

13
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:51,209
in the Golden State industrial hemp has

14
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,859
been legalized for relief so now it's up

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,410
to each state to come up with their

16
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,960
state plan along with fairly recognized

17
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:04,259
Indian tribes submit that to the USDA

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:06,960
get that approved and then so one of the

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,659
leads into kind of our first topic which

20
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,449
is going to be a double edged sword it's

21
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,850
on the regulatory aspects which are kind

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,368
of different in every industry we're

23
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:19,919
pretty retail focused on this panel and

24
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,049
some people are you know transitioning

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,390
from the cannabis space into the

26
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,368
industrial hemp space so if we just

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,019
start out kind of talking about some of

28
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:30,118
the challenges what we've encountered

29
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,789
today you know trying to work with

30
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,859
farmers retail whether it's an you know

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,590
getting CBD products or packaging

32
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,118
products into retail space or adding to

33
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,880
your product line that's already going

34
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,938
on anybody wants to jump off there James

35
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,129
yeah I guess I can you know start off

36
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,408
just by touching on some of the

37
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:52,769
challenges we faced using hemp

38
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,859
bioplastic as a packaging material as it

39
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:58,468
relates to regulatory stuff when we

40
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:02,188
started working on this project we were

41
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,839
under the 2014 farm bill so you know

42
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,699
that made it really difficult for us to

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,098
put together a supply chain because we

44
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,710
had to find a source of hemp that was

45
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,569
being cultivated you know we

46
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,270
we believed very strongly and just using

47
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:15,709
domestically grown hemp and you know

48
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,350
finding and putting all those pieces

49
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,540
together from it being grown under the

50
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:23,629
pilot program to finding someone who's

51
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:26,780
actually processing it to specs that we

52
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:29,000
could use as useful materials was an

53
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,439
incredibly difficult process and one of

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,939
the things that excites me about the

55
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:38,329
2018 farm bill is that is not just as

56
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:40,039
more hemp comes online there will also

57
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,780
be more infrastructure and I think

58
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,609
that's one of the biggest things lacking

59
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,469
currently in the industry is you know

60
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,690
every farmer in the country could go

61
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:49,639
grow him tomorrow and that would be

62
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:52,550
great but if we're unable to process it

63
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,500
into useful materials it doesn't do us

64
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,230
any good so that's what I'm looking

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:02,120
forward to the most with legalization is

66
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:05,239
not just more hemp more infrastructure I

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,590
can say one of the difficulties that I'm

68
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,770
gonna face in the Santa Barbara County

69
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,770
is the cannabis growers they are

70
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,960
opposing not strongly but they're very

71
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,480
concerned about their cannabis crops

72
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,110
regarding growing hemp so for right now

73
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:23,209
my County cross-pollination now isn't

74
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,520
allowing any growth or any thought of

75
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,909
growth you can't file for a permit or

76
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,590
anything or even register for one until

77
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:33,349
2020 because they want to have all the

78
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:38,360
regulations in place prior to opening up

79
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:42,349
farmers to start farming yeah and and in

80
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:46,010
in media it's you know obviously we're

81
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:47,810
we can only work with people who are in

82
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:50,179
compliance with legal legal grows and

83
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,710
whatnot in its keeping up with the the

84
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,810
constant lists like it seems like every

85
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,330
day something is changing and not just

86
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:00,500
in California but you know we say that's

87
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:03,260
our that's our market here but it's it's

88
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,500
it's a challenge it's a huge challenge

89
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:09,169
and you know there's there's no easy

90
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,539
easy way to to really get around that

91
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:12,679
other than you know to be in this

92
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:14,579
industry you just have to have a heck of

93
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,840
a lot of patience and a lot of tenacity

94
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,840
[Laughter]

95
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:28,219
exactly and you know in as far as the

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,110
native in the Native American circle

97
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,040
this is a an issue that's close to my

98
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,569
heart my sons are half native and I

99
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,850
actually did get to visit you know Alex

100
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:41,550
white plume three years ago for a

101
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:48,060
planting which which went awry because

102
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:51,840
of seeds that came from anyway but and

103
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:55,939
it's a challenge in in many ways within

104
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:59,039
that within that culture as well because

105
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:02,040
one there's a very high level of

106
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,340
distrust understandably so and you know

107
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,860
with that with the regulations changing

108
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:11,129
all the time as well that that doesn't

109
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,230
help that you know so - we'll get into

110
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:16,110
this a little bit later but you know

111
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,660
that there are groups forming - to help

112
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,250
with legislation specifically for

113
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,810
natives and I you know I think that

114
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:40,228
that's that's a huge step in the right

115
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:43,019
direction exactly yes at the retail

116
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:44,819
aspect and have you tried to expand your

117
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:52,279
product line in the CBD in Santa Monica

118
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:52,279
so let's see we're focused on making

119
00:05:52,939 --> 00:06:01,288
clothing and accessories what the change

120
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:03,870
in the legal landscape has been to us so

121
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:06,120
on the CBD front of several years ago

122
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:11,009
when I started using CBD products I

123
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,899
thought oh I and I knew some people in

124
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:14,909
Colorado baking them I don't know I can

125
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:18,049
just privately well these guys do this

126
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:21,000
and well and had I done that I would be

127
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,800
one of the people you know more firmly

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,899
established in the market but what I

129
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,910
read what I realized would happen which

130
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:28,919
is what kind of happening is that

131
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:34,770
there's this just proliferation of

132
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:38,000
brands and there's not necessarily the

133
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:41,099
mature retail shelf space market to

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,810
handle and display them all and the

135
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,700
smoke shops are kind of coming aboard

136
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,680
but they're probably going with not

137
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,599
necessarily artisinal brands or brands

138
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,040
that care that much and then there's you

139
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,140
know your other ones which are just

140
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,000
throwing everything in the shelf and

141
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,669
making tons of money and then and then

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,519
there's you know little places like like

143
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:06,090
vital hemp where I've selected a few

144
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:12,029
brands I know it's clean and then what's

145
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:20,489
going to happen you know Charlotte's Web

146
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:22,379
guys who people who well you're getting

147
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,360
both the pharmaceutical side that's

148
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,949
coming in from a bad angle but also

149
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,720
people like John rule a can read

150
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:29,819
botanicals who are coming at it from I

151
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,430
would say a more ecologically minded

152
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,560
ethical perspective and growing you know

153
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,360
supporting regenerative farming making

154
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,120
sure that the entire supply chain is

155
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:43,199
organic and so forth so what we're doing

156
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,329
in my shop is were still just I did I

157
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,659
decided not to go into CBD I just didn't

158
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:52,139
have the resources to manage production

159
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:55,200
and you know grow a CBD one maybe it was

160
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,120
foolish I don't know but I'm happy just

161
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,310
focusing on the things that I like to do

162
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,129
and because there are so many companies

163
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:05,220
now there are new hemp t-shirts so

164
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:05,219
[Music]

165
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:11,128
there was a statement released by the

166
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:13,800
California Department of Public Health

167
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:17,310
that it was more of a notice than an

168
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,460
actual enforcement on CVD in food and

169
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,168
beverage products in California so

170
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,448
there's there's been a questionable or

171
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,848
gray area there where you see it on like

172
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,889
shelves at Lassen's or erawan and

173
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:30,870
there's definitely some small artisanal

174
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:32,700
brands and retail outlets carrying it as

175
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,979
well in California and I think right now

176
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,649
it's kind of a matter of enforcement

177
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,899
like no one's going in and pulling CBD

178
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:43,828
off shelves similar to they did in

179
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:45,299
Indiana but and there's definitely a lot

180
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:47,219
of regulations in terms of the

181
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:49,528
advertising marketing i've seen some you

182
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,449
know coy CBD and other brands that they

183
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:53,070
have billboards in the area and then

184
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,870
supply chain sounds like it's a real

185
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,089
dilemma if you guys want to follow up on

186
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,100
anything there no I was just gonna say

187
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:00,360
much you know mostly what you see now

188
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,100
and they because people have asked me

189
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,339
like well I thought you said I could buy

190
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,519
CBD at this at this place and you know

191
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:10,500
but the labels now say hemp oil it did

192
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,528
there so that's a part of the way that I

193
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,110
think people are you know safeguard

194
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:18,958
safeguarding themselves but um yeah it's

195
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,199
uh it's interesting to see where that

196
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:25,349
will go

197
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:26,789
yeah and there's several different kind

198
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,490
of markers on that too so they can

199
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:31,649
advertise it as a hemp extract or it

200
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,049
could be a hemp derived CBD versus you

201
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,059
know a can high THC cannabis derived CBD

202
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:38,639
I think that's where the crossover and

203
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,439
like lonas model come in or or even in

204
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,578
sauna packaging because you guys are

205
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,260
having to integrate with the

206
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:47,129
dispensaries you know with the hemp

207
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:49,860
product and it's exactly one of the

208
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:52,049
things - I think that's you know

209
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,419
interesting with hemp right now in the

210
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:57,208
United States is there there is such a

211
00:09:54,419 --> 00:10:00,629
huge focus on growing specifically high

212
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:03,179
CBD hemp and I think it makes sense for

213
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:05,179
right now because we have were able to

214
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,399
process that and there's there

215
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:09,049
tons of equipment available for that in

216
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,569
the United States so it's an easy

217
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:12,859
business model to set up but in the long

218
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,470
term we're gonna have to start growing

219
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,210
other varieties of hemp as well that are

220
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,680
you know more adept to your fiber

221
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,720
production or seed production or what

222
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:24,289
have you you know all the different uses

223
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,899
so and also you know taking into account

224
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:29,269
the fact that industrial applications is

225
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:33,079
you know by far in a way gonna be the

226
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:34,819
largest use for him you know it'll be

227
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,180
interesting to see how that plays out

228
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,310
how the how the u.s. CBD market

229
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,429
stabilizes within the greater US hemp

230
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:45,319
economy I don't have any answers here

231
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:48,589
I'm just really curious to see what

232
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:52,040
happens and I I just I hope we execute

233
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:56,300
it well can I jump in just for a second

234
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,409
so about ten years ago I was at the

235
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:59,209
Natural Products Expo

236
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:01,490
because I was doing my best to help out

237
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,810
the Natural Products Expo and they've

238
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,659
been a little more resistant than they

239
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:07,489
have community but I connected with this

240
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:09,189
guy named Don were Shafter who I'd sort

241
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:15,139
of known through the hemp community and

242
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:19,820
he was instrumental in bringing hemp in

243
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:22,879
hemp oil and to the states with products

244
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,010
like you know helping nutiva and others

245
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,289
so I asked him I said so what what do

246
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:29,389
you think it's the prognosis for for

247
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:34,360
hemp what's gonna happen Donnie and he

248
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:37,399
said well he says it's already all

249
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,300
basically decided you know he says uh

250
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:44,629
but he said but I'll tell you one thing

251
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:52,639
hemp bioplastics alone will dwarf the

252
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:55,519
entire marijuana market I was like whoa

253
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:59,120
that's that's kind of a statement I

254
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,250
hadn't I hadn't quite thought of it in

255
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,580
those terms but then later I learned

256
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,649
that Audi and BMW and mercedes-benz are

257
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,180
y'all using you know hemp bioplastics

258
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:10,490
for the interior body panels of their

259
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:14,029
there are cars and so when you think

260
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:16,580
about those companies with such an

261
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,899
institutional legacy and such incredible

262
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,960
engineering

263
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,759
you know finesse choosing him then you

264
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,480
just got to realize like well then there

265
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:28,750
must be a thousand other industries that

266
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,980
are going to also switch to this more

267
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,330
sustainable better performing solutions

268
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,710
and how about if we start with straws

269
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:38,600
because there's a huge you know yeah

270
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,700
there's a huge movement to you know

271
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,990
people are banning straws like well okay

272
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,970
if we want straws let's how about some

273
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:49,240
that will decompose and put in less than

274
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,240
four months and you do this design gel

275
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,870
all that have plastic that you're seeing

276
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,028
on the market right now is fiber

277
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,330
reinforced bio composites meaning that

278
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:04,820
you're using a base resin you know

279
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:07,730
typically a PLA that's what we use which

280
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,830
is typically made from corn and then

281
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,960
you're infusing that with a micronized

282
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,879
tempered so the formulation that we're

283
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,639
using the most hemp we were able to get

284
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:19,879
into it is 30 percent hemp so it's 30

285
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,059
percent hem 70 percent corn but because

286
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:24,970
it is a fiber reinforced biocomposite we

287
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:27,979
can't do transparent or translucent

288
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:31,370
plastics or flexible plastics yet so

289
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:36,080
things like straws which can be all of

290
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:38,570
those things are difficult right now in

291
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,200
order to get to a point where you know

292
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:45,440
we can have wall thicknesses that thin

293
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,930
and stuff like that we have to be making

294
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,060
plastic out of hemp the same way that we

295
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:52,069
make PLA which is you know done by you

296
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:54,319
know extracting cellulose and the sugar

297
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,660
making plastic that way and it's not a

298
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,550
question of reinventing the wheel it's

299
00:13:56,659 --> 00:14:01,250
what we do with corn but it is a

300
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:04,969
question of readapting this technology

301
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:08,000
to a new biomass feedstock and then you

302
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,589
know not just doing that because we

303
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,360
could go out and do it but it's a

304
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:13,430
question of being able to do it on scale

305
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,110
and being able to produce the material

306
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:16,219
at a price point where people would

307
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,350
actually buy it

308
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,850
because with things like packaging to

309
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,759
which are typically really low cost

310
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,560
items you really have to factor in you

311
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,360
know what will people actually pay for

312
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,509
this

313
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,580
and who this might be a silly question

314
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:33,620
but it is do you know someone who's

315
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,080
actually working on are we gonna have we

316
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,720
started the road to get there we're with

317
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,520
the like everyday plastics so we we're

318
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,040
definitely on the road I think there's

319
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,689
there's a ways to go until we're fully

320
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,659
there I think you're you're not gonna

321
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,850
see much besides fiber reinforced bio

322
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:51,230
composites for the next I'd say at least

323
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:55,100
like you know kind of three to five

324
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,690
years and you know and going back to

325
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,040
what you were saying about you know a

326
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,520
bioplastic

327
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:04,879
possibly dwarfing these other parts of

328
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,289
the industry there is a ton that needs

329
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,330
to happen on the supply chain and

330
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:10,639
infrastructure side of things for that

331
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,680
to become a reality and there I think

332
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,340
realistically you're looking you know 10

333
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:19,250
15 years out to where because we also

334
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,470
have to keep in mind with plastics and

335
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,929
just biomass in general is you're

336
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,720
competing with crude oil which is the

337
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:29,569
single most sophisticated supply chain

338
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,330
that we have ever created for anything

339
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,910
and you know the ships and the pipelines

340
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,770
that we use to move crude oil around the

341
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:39,799
world or some of the most high-tech

342
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:44,179
machinery ever designed besides like a

343
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:47,599
spacecraft so and biomass has moved on

344
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:50,389
trains and trucks so that's what we're

345
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,659
competing and I think this is a good

346
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:56,330
segue into the next topic which would be

347
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:59,059
the environmental component of him you

348
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:01,550
know we hear a lot towards the 25,000

349
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:03,079
different uses and I think however many

350
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:05,659
it is that one of the things that stands

351
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,090
out is that hemp seems to perform nearly

352
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:09,350
better than any other option and so

353
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,940
that's that's where some of its

354
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,690
usefulness and utility I think really

355
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:16,840
comes in so in terms of the the

356
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:20,570
environmental aspect we know that it has

357
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:22,700
great benefits to soil and air quality

358
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:26,150
and putting carbon back in the earth at

359
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,560
the farming component but also let's

360
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:29,980
talk a little bit about you know

361
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:33,469
limiting waste and

362
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:36,560
reusable products that can come from him

363
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,360
and most importantly I think the

364
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,659
environmental aspect that inspired you

365
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:51,479
to do your certain businesses today

366
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:51,478
