2
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,500
always an honor and a privilege to be

3
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:23,000
here with congressman Dana Rohrabacher

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,088
all right Dana why don't you tell us a

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,800
little bit about what you've been doing

6
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:29,778
to support the industry over the years

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,920
and what your outlook is for the future

8
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:36,859
I am an optimist because we started just

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,840
10 years ago remember we didn't have the

10
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:41,149
Rohrabacher Farr amendment and now it's

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,789
Rohrbacher bloom an hour we didn't have

12
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:46,640
that and our government was able to run

13
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:48,350
roughshod over anything what local

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,948
people wanted to do when it came to

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,350
cannabis well now with robach afar and

16
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:56,750
we've managed to get a majority vote on

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,230
this twice now through the United States

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:04,099
Congress and it is currently law you

19
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:06,188
can't have the DEA coming in when it

20
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:09,228
comes to medical marijuana and

21
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:11,449
superseding the state law so that people

22
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:14,750
are dealing with medical marijuana at

23
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:17,299
least that part of it is are safe from

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,069
being arrested by the federal

25
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,618
authorities and having all of their

26
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:24,169
property confiscated now at least we

27
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:26,509
have that kind of protection and in the

28
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,750
future I think in the next election

29
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:32,478
cycle I think we're going to come to a

30
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,509
tipping point this is this is a turning

31
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:38,599
point on this issue and we will see that

32
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:40,489
not just the Department of Justice but

33
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,559
all the departments and agencies of the

34
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:45,649
federal government we'll leave it up to

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,200
the states because President Trump has

36
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:51,259
made that promise love him or hate him

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,939
he keeps his promises and that's to

38
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:56,750
legalize

39
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:59,989
medical marijuana and personal use by

40
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,450
leaving that up to the states as our

41
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:04,609
biggest champion on the Republican

42
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:08,180
caucus just looking at worst-case

43
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:11,240
scenario if you don't win your

44
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,920
re-election in November what are the

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,200
prospects for the for the Rohrbacher

46
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,329
protections well the first thing that

47
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,189
will happen if I lose the election is

48
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,630
I'm going to go surfing and drink

49
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:29,960
tequila for at least three or four

50
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:32,180
months anyway so however I I'm in a

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,240
really tough race I do believe I'll be

52
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,980
on top when it comes because I'm I

53
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,939
believe in freedom and I think my

54
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:42,739
constituents believe in freedom and

55
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:45,139
however if I do lose

56
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,770
there'll be it'll be a lot tougher in

57
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:50,959
Congress because they have grown used to

58
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,719
someone who's acceptable to the

59
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,810
conservative Republicans mobilizing

60
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:59,180
those votes and we need those votes to

61
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,129
accomplish our goal which is to get the

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,780
federal government out of this issue and

63
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:05,659
leave it to the states and local

64
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,969
government so it'll be a lot harder if

65
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:11,270
I'm not around but I am predicting that

66
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:12,550
I will win and I'm predicting that once

67
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,280
that happens

68
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:19,300
president Trump will then he will keep

69
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,370
his word he will support legislation

70
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,560
that leaves this issue up to the states

71
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,500
they did he made that pledge during the

72
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,140
campaign love him or hate him he keeps

73
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,689
his word about trying to initiate what

74
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:35,449
what he promised he'd do so I'm

75
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:38,659
optimistic that should I be elected and

76
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:42,259
I think I can be and will be that we

77
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:44,840
will be able to have some great steps

78
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:48,750
forward and there'll be no cup of going

79
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,099
back after this next congressional

80
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,849
all right and what about you know this

81
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:57,069
is an America first administration and I

82
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:58,900
think that you know I think that we both

83
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,370
agree that that part of the America

84
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,030
first policy should also be putting

85
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,969
America's cannabis industry first and

86
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,250
you know we we recently just just

87
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,680
acquired cannabis for research from

88
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:15,340
Canada of course Canada legalized

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,139
marijuana last week and III you know

90
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,899
have some concerns that you know we're

91
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:22,659
falling behind in the global market what

92
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,969
do you think that this administration is

93
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,770
going to do to help you know make the

94
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,470
make America's cannabis industry great

95
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:32,560
again how about making how about making

96
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,290
America's farmers great again by letting

97
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,889
them grow cannabis that's exactly right

98
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:41,560
the fact is that cannabis will be not it

99
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:44,409
will will affect American agriculture in

100
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,009
so many ways that people don't even know

101
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:51,580
now first of all cannabis isn't just for

102
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:54,939
smoking cannabis is also for paper for

103
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:58,269
cloth cannabis can be used for so many

104
00:04:54,939 --> 00:05:00,040
things and our farmers which now we end

105
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:03,089
up having to pay not to grow certain

106
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,879
crops they will be able to grow cannabis

107
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:09,369
for rope why should we buy hemp for rope

108
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,199
from anybody else in the world we've

109
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,620
been giving over a billion and a half

110
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,680
dollars to Canada every year so we can

111
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,180
buy hemp from them how ridiculous is

112
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,699
that our farmers should be getting that

113
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,360
money and also there's something else

114
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:27,810
that will happen and I believe the

115
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,240
cannabis industry will be

116
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:34,800
revolutionising agriculture in the sense

117
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:39,189
that they are now turning old buildings

118
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:43,120
into into manufacturing facilities for

119
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:45,399
food and they we could see cannabis they

120
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,949
put all of the scientific knowledge and

121
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:51,729
engineering to grow cannabis plants

122
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:53,409
inside these old warehouses what they're

123
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,759
learning from that will be put to use

124
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:59,210
across the board to help me grow

125
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,668
vegetables and other

126
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:03,769
so the cannabis industry is not only

127
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:07,098
going to be revolutionized in what it

128
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:09,318
can do and when just cannabis but also

129
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:10,788
for the other crops that they are

130
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,580
teaching they are now revolutionizing

131
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:18,949
the production of other crops in America

132
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:20,689
that's absolutely right it's a little

133
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,669
personal question here is I know you've

134
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:25,370
been you're back to surfing which is

135
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:27,459
excellent and I think I think that you

136
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,978
also the only member of Congress who has

137
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:35,978
come out as a consumer of cannabis or

138
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:37,668
through topical non psychoactive topical

139
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:40,399
applications is there any connection

140
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:43,389
there well I will have to tell you I had

141
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,579
both of these shoulders replaced because

142
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:48,769
thirty years of heavy surfing and I

143
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:51,288
surfed all the Cartledge away and I

144
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:53,658
couldn't even move these arms and so it

145
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:56,060
was so painful and I was speaking to

146
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:58,310
work somebody had cannabis they said

147
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,158
well what you need to do is rub some of

148
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:04,430
this cannabis salve on it well it was in

149
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:06,709
fact I can't tell you whether or not the

150
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,470
cannabis was what it was but I can tell

151
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:14,359
you right now after shoulder

152
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:18,110
replacements there it is I can both arms

153
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:21,169
now these are all metal now and if I'm

154
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:24,348
going to be a surfer again I'm going to

155
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:25,968
keep these arms operating and I bet

156
00:07:24,348 --> 00:07:28,939
you're not the only member of Congress

157
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:30,319
that uses medical cannabis or cannabis

158
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:31,788
Oh have you heard have you heard

159
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,079
anything down there in the gym or in the

160
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:38,509
the Congressional locker room about

161
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,370
other members of Congress I know that

162
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:42,169
there are people who have had suffering

163
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,360
just like anyplace else

164
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:47,029
older people have things that they

165
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,468
suffer under and I know there are some

166
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:56,348
people everywhere who are utilizing

167
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:56,348
cannabis to take care of their maladies

168
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:04,719
I have put cannabis salve on my arms

169
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:06,250
when I had horrible pain because all the

170
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,190
cartilage had been worn away because I'm

171
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,139
a surfer and I was suffering with this

172
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:13,870
horrible pain

173
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:16,990
yeah I put cannabis salve on it I

174
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:19,000
actually admitted that before a group of

175
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,370
people and it sort of made national news

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,790
but but again what's wrong with that

177
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:28,180
what is wrong with anybody putting a

178
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:31,300
salve with it's based on cannabis on

179
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,600
their arm to alleviate their pain I got

180
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,250
no problems with it many men

181
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:40,450
it's absolutely legal here in California

182
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:44,019
yes now that Canada has legalized

183
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:47,170
cannabis nationally in your view has the

184
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:49,659
federal government or Congress are they

185
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:52,389
taking any lessons from that that might

186
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:54,399
be applied toward legalizing here in the

187
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:56,409
United States well it's important of

188
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,429
course for our farmers to be able to

189
00:08:56,409 --> 00:09:03,399
compete with these farmers up in Canada

190
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:07,239
who are now producing what is a cash

191
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,189
crop and hey I want those billions of

192
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,019
dollars to come here I love the

193
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,180
Canadians but I want that money here to

194
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:14,740
our own farmers but however there's

195
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:18,269
another lesson when it come when you

196
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:23,110
come to other countries by outline

197
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:26,620
cannabis here we have financed the drug

198
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,659
cartels in Mexico the people who are

199
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,360
growing cannabis in Mexico are not like

200
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:33,730
the folks up in Canada these are people

201
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,960
who are gangsters just like we had to

202
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,139
deal with gangsters when we had

203
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:41,170
prohibition of alcohol we need to make

204
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:43,569
sure that we legalize cannabis here and

205
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:46,629
make sure honest businesspeople and

206
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:50,590
honest farmers are engaged in this new

207
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:53,679
enterprise rather than depending on the

208
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:56,800
what the drug cartels of Mexico and

209
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:59,169
we're financing those drug cartels we

210
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:02,919
could correct that it'll help Mexico

211
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:04,240
it'll help us I think that the industry

212
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:08,110
is not

213
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,659
mobilizing people to go see their

214
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:15,369
personal congressman instead they've

215
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:18,789
made a much broader effort to try to if

216
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:21,790
that Congress as a whole and by going

217
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:24,188
and doing the work necessary to find out

218
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:25,899
whose constituents who are the

219
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:27,818
constituents of those people standing in

220
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,278
the way I think we could have been a lot

221
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:32,769
more effective on that who are the

222
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,629
veterans from so-and-so's district who

223
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:37,419
are the people who who have children our

224
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:39,879
seniors our senior citizens groups from

225
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,909
a person from one specific congressman's

226
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:45,009
district who is a no vote now so we need

227
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:47,249
to do that and I would hope that the

228
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:49,959
industry is gonna be much more

229
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:53,199
grassroots I don't that's the word

230
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:56,409
grassroots when it comes to getting this

231
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:59,139
job done yeah I couldn't agree more I

232
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:00,938
mean I I told people in the industry

233
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:03,100
that every day that just having the

234
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:04,928
conversations with elected officials at

235
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,509
all levels not not just Congress even at

236
00:11:04,928 --> 00:11:11,980
the City Council and state state state

237
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:13,899
house makes such a difference and it's

238
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,639
so important that the industry to also

239
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:17,980
understand that we haven't won this yet

240
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,990
you know we're still it's not time to

241
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,278
sit back and rest on our laurels there's

242
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,568
still a lot of work to do and you gotta

243
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:29,269
win it one elected official at a time

244
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:32,399
not as a whole there you go

245
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:32,399
