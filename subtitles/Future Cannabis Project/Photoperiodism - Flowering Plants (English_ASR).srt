1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,479
hello this is travis from the hip mind

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,040
um what you are watching today is part

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,200
one

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,440
of two parts on the topic of

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:13,919
photoperiodism

6
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,119
um i'm sure some of you who are watching

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,440
are thinking what the heck is

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,038
photoperiodism

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,600
but for those of you who are watching

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,960
who are currently in the hemp industry

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,080
or the cannabis industry this is a topic

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,240
that is not

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,239
discussed as often as it should be

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,759
and the reason that is is just because

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
of the

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:39,199
you know the nascent and new market

17
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,839
of of cannabis in general if we compare

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,239
it to other mature markets

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
what i'd like to do through this video

20
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,038
is for one

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:51,840
address the concept of photoperiodism

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,800
help you have an appreciation for it as

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,520
well as a basic

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,359
understanding of what it is discuss

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,000
photoperiodic classes

26
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,558
maybe connect some dots between plants

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
that you

28
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,959
you grew up enjoying and how

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,000
they um and how they're manipulated

30
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:13,519
to flower similar to how we manipulate

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,680
cannabis to flower and and then

32
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,519
go through some practical scenarios in

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,439
the greenhouse and in the field

34
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,640
on how you can use this understanding to

35
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,519
manipulate the crop

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,799
to your benefit ultimately increasing

37
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,319
your your bottom line

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,960
at the end of the season or at the end

39
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,959
of the cycle

40
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:31,759
[Music]

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,600
first before we jump into the

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,959
presentation itself i want to give you

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,039
just a quick

44
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,078
understanding of my background and why

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,840
why it's pertinent

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:44,000
to to what we're talking about um

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,920
myself as well as my business partner dr

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,799
alice and justice both of us have been

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,840
trained

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,600
in commercial horticulture i went to

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,118
school at clemson and virginia tech for

52
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,319
environmental horticulture

53
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,478
and then went and worked with one of the

54
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,398
largest ornamental crop

55
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:04,158
growers in the country if we think about

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,320
agriculture we have a branch off of

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,879
agriculture which is horticulture

58
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,038
right and this is shrub production tree

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,318
production flower production

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,839
but then from horticulture we have a

61
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:19,839
branch of flora culture

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,598
and that is the background that both

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,200
myself and my business partner have we

64
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,000
have an extensive background in flora

65
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:29,598
cultural crop production

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,400
um the reason i i bring this up is

67
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,679
because

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,519
you know i i think back to my my career

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,640
in the ornamental industry and i i

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,920
hold that experience of extreme

71
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:45,039
value you know this is a mature

72
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,839
market it has a

73
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,359
supply chain which has been completely

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,000
developed

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,599
and in many cases those who are in it

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,120
understand the potential

77
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,639
of it and the only way to secure more

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,480
business

79
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,238
or the only way to grow is to maximize

80
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,318
internal production regarding

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,039
consistency and efficiency

82
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:12,878
to a level that can benefit from

83
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,878
shoestring margins at the end of the day

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,560
in these mature horticultural and

85
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,679
floricultural markets

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,560
those that are dealing with such a small

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,360
margin

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,360
at the end of the year

89
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:33,119
they are incentivized to understand

90
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:35,199
crop physiology to a depth at which

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,920
the cannabis industry has yet to even

92
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,479
touch the surface of

93
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,719
but now let's let's bring some of what

94
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:46,318
we've learned from these mature markets

95
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,639
into the cannabis market okay let's

96
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,479
let's you know stop in some cases

97
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,759
banging our head on the wall saying

98
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,959
what's next

99
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,039
and start to truly be innovative and

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,640
utilize some of the concepts that are

101
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,280
already known within

102
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,798
mature horticultural markets and start

103
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,640
implementing them

104
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,640
in the cannabis industry

105
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,799
so through this video what i'd like to

106
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,399
do is i'd like to touch on what the heck

107
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,400
is photoperiodism

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,399
why does it matter to you what are

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,600
photoperiodic classes

110
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,638
what class is cannabis

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,479
um then let's

112
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,560
talk through some scenarios and examples

113
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,560
being indoors being in a greenhouse

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
being in multiple different latitudes in

115
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
the us regarding field production of

116
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,560
hemp

117
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,439
and ultimately equip you to

118
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,160
maximize the potential of the genetics

119
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,360
and of

120
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,040
the cannabis plants that you have

121
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,600
to increase your bottom line okay

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,160
and so with that said let's jump into

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
the meat

124
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,000
of this video moving forward into the

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,800
future the hip mind will release what

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,639
we're calling

127
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,560
our technical support series and the

128
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,199
first topic that we'll be

129
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,879
discussing is photoperiodism and again

130
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,520
like i said i will be

131
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,399
presenting on part one and later on

132
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,000
allison will

133
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,399
launch another video which will be

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,240
presenting on part two

135
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:18,959
so what is photoperiodism

136
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,478
just so that whomever is watching i want

137
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,638
us all to be on the same page i'm going

138
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,319
to read exactly what this bullet this

139
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,240
first bullet says

140
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,478
photoperiodism is a physiological

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,478
response in multiple different plant

142
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,719
species that dictates whether or not the

143
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,519
plant is focused on vegetative growth

144
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,840
or reproductive growth this response in

145
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,038
photoperiodic plants is dictated based

146
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,599
on the amount of

147
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,360
darkness a plant receives during a

148
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,439
single 24 hour period and then

149
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,960
consistently thereafter

150
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,038
i know many of you have heard the term

151
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,638
photoperiod

152
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,800
and this refers to the amount of light

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,360
hours in a given 24 hour

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,800
period you know humans work during the

155
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,038
day we see when the light is

156
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
lights are on or the sun is out we work

157
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,399
during the day

158
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,758
and so when we discuss photoperiodic

159
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,079
plants we discuss

160
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,600
the photo period the amount of time

161
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,879
light is on or the sun

162
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,520
is out we do not discuss the duration of

163
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,600
the night period even though we know

164
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,120
that the length of the night period

165
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,560
obviously correlates with the length of

166
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,360
the day when we're only focused on

167
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,199
discussing a 24-hour period

168
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,960
but we know that plants ultimately

169
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,120
perceive the length of the night

170
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,038
so moving forward when discussing

171
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,038
photoperiodic plants and i say

172
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,240
photoperiod i'm talking about the length

173
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,279
of the day

174
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,280
and not the length of the night there

175
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,478
are different types of photoperiodic

176
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,399
classes

177
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,240
and these classes include long day

178
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,679
plants short day plants

179
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,680
day length neutral

180
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,519
cannabis falls into the short plant

181
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,000
short day plant category

182
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,079
and what this means is in order to

183
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,120
maximize the potential of this

184
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,959
crop um based specifically

185
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,319
you know in in certain facets of the

186
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,758
market that you're participating

187
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,360
in we need to maximize the production of

188
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,120
this plant by giving it a

189
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,439
long day followed then by a short day

190
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,478
and this transition from a long day to a

191
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,120
short day

192
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,560
initiates flowering causes the plant to

193
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,840
go from vegetative growth to

194
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
reproductive growth

195
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,959
okay and so that's a short day plant

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,759
long day and then a short day

197
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,680
um and then for long day plants it's

198
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,080
flipped

199
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,280
in some cases in order to maximize the

200
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,120
the potential of

201
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,318
other species you have to give them a

202
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,000
short day

203
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,720
followed by a long day

204
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and you know in the cannabis industry

205
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,360
there's also

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,240
much discussion around autoflower um

207
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,639
genetics and you know autoflower i

208
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
believe

209
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,160
is a little bit a little bit different

210
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,199
than day neutral but very

211
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,000
very similar concepts that you're not

212
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,840
subject to the

213
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,439
length of the day it's more of either an

214
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,519
accumulation of

215
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:07,519
of um an accumulation of growth that

216
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,240
triggers flower development

217
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,359
um but what we're going to focus on

218
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
today

219
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,479
is short day plants however i do want to

220
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,239
make one

221
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:20,318
one more thought apparent here there are

222
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,240
additional characteristics that can be

223
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,800
attached to these photoperiodic classes

224
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,319
right so it can go even a level deeper

225
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
in the complexity of these different

226
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,840
flowering responses

227
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,439
and so for example you could even have

228
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:35,199
obligate short day plants

229
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,120
or facultative long day plants

230
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,440
i'll give one example of this so a good

231
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,799
example of a facultative long day plant

232
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:47,200
is greenhouse vine vine crop tomatoes

233
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,359
in some cases it's been proven that they

234
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,278
are facultative long day which means the

235
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,278
longer the day the better

236
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,799
regarding flower development and fruit

237
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,639
set however

238
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,240
they have also learned that there is

239
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,399
something as too long

240
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,039
of a day so you know just keep in mind

241
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,958
that

242
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,719
that we're having to navigate through

243
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,399
these different flowering responses for

244
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,399
multiple crops and

245
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,639
it is certainly nothing new um

246
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,799
so growing up i'm sure maybe your mom

247
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,000
had garden mums on the porch in the fall

248
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,759
and if not had

249
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,839
you know christmas poinsettias on the

250
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,799
fireplace

251
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,120
but these plants have the exact same if

252
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,599
not very similar

253
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,200
short day photoperiodic nature to them

254
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
that cannabis has

255
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,640
and these plants have been grown for

256
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,680
decades and we've learned an

257
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:40,879
extreme amount from maximizing

258
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,559
the production of these these plants

259
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,559
and so one thing i like to just point

260
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,559
out is this is nothing new why is the

261
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,838
cannabis industry not talking about

262
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,079
photoperiodism

263
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,399
when it's how we dictate and forecast

264
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,839
production of these other crops

265
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,360
we should so with

266
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,519
a basic understanding of what

267
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,360
photoperiodism is and understanding that

268
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,240
cannabis is a short day crop meaning

269
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,159
that you need

270
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,919
a short day preceded by a long day in

271
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,639
order to trigger flowering

272
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,519
let's now look at it look at an example

273
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,519
of an indoor

274
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,320
schedule the schedule here is just an

275
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,720
example i will admit that

276
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,560
this is this schedule is widely used

277
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,480
within completely climate-controlled

278
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,399
medical marijuana facilities to

279
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,600
smokeable flower greenhouse hemp

280
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,360
facilities

281
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,079
but let's just break it down and just

282
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,480
walk through it so that we understand

283
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,559
um how to look at this from a crop

284
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,759
development standpoint as well as a

285
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,199
production stage standpoint so if we

286
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,879
look at the

287
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,839
at the top of the the graphic here

288
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,200
i have production stage so we have

289
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,600
propagation

290
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,360
then i have the vegetative stage in

291
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,639
other mature markets in some cases you

292
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,278
call this bulking

293
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,199
and then we have flower development

294
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,200
these are three specific different

295
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,600
production stages

296
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,800
under that we have week number this is

297
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,120
not year week

298
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,559
this is week number within this single

299
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,799
cycle

300
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,599
and so let's start with discussing

301
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,319
propagation

302
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,519
in propagation and i'm focusing on um

303
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,720
schedules that

304
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,679
uh originate from using vegetative

305
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,920
material

306
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,799
so in propagation let's say that you you

307
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,838
have

308
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,799
mother stock growing um and you take a

309
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,519
cutting

310
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,319
and for this example let's use a 72 cell

311
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,360
tray

312
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,600
you take a cutting an unrooted clone

313
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,519
and you stick this in a 72 cell tray in

314
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,399
a propagation environment

315
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,519
you ideally can route this between 14 to

316
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,000
21 days

317
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,759
for the sake of the example i used 14 in

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,600
a perfect world we could root everything

319
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,399
in 14 days

320
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,519
so we are in we have the understanding

321
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,958
of okay we need to go through

322
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,759
propagation first

323
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,239
we need to root these plants but what

324
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,159
crop

325
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,440
development stage do we want to keep

326
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,958
them in we want to keep them in a

327
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,000
vegetative state

328
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:04,958
so we apply a long day and

329
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,519
in this case we apply an extremely long

330
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,638
day

331
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,639
of 18 hours

332
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,439
you know if uh it's been interesting for

333
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,320
me to understand why the cannabis

334
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,959
industry

335
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,360
by default is using 18 hours is a long

336
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,479
day and 12 hours is a short day

337
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,079
and what what we've come up with is that

338
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,519
you know if you were to open a crop

339
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,559
physiology book and you

340
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,679
you were to read through i guess the

341
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,759
photoperiodism

342
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:37,039
section by the book

343
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:40,399
for most plants a

344
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:43,759
long day is anything above

345
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,759
12 hours so the day length of anything

346
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:49,278
longer than 12 hours

347
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:53,519
and a short day is 12 hours or

348
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:57,278
less and so within the cannabis industry

349
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,200
um it's widely used that 12 hours

350
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,039
is the photo period at which you should

351
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,720
initiate flowering with

352
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,399
and i i do believe that that's just

353
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,680
because by the book

354
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,879
that's what it says we also are using 18

355
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,319
hours

356
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,320
as a long day because that's an

357
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,399
extremely long day we're pretty much

358
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,720
guaranteed that that plant is going to

359
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,159
stay

360
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,160
vegetative so that's why in this example

361
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,639
i show 1812 because

362
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,600
in most cannabis facilities throughout

363
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,440
the world

364
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,920
they're using this lighting schedule

365
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,120
which i hope after we watch this video

366
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,919
for those of you that are growing

367
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,959
indoors

368
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,039
let's challenge this a little bit okay

369
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,439
so let's move from propagation and now

370
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,919
discuss the vegetative stage

371
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,920
of crop production and so from

372
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,000
propagation like i said we have a 72

373
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,879
cell tray that's been rooted between

374
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,519
14 to 21 days we're still under a long

375
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,799
day

376
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,720
because we want to keep the plants

377
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,519
vegetative now let's

378
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,399
transplant these rooted clones these

379
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,839
liners

380
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,198
into larger pots and perhaps move them

381
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,880
into a different room or

382
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,799
move them and space them out in the

383
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,679
greenhouse and keep them

384
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,198
again under long days for three more

385
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,958
weeks so that we can build some

386
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,159
size on these plants the vegetative part

387
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,159
of this cycle

388
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,240
is focused on these plants building a

389
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,480
root system focusing on

390
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,399
leaf development shoot development cell

391
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,879
elongation cell division making these

392
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,919
plants

393
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:29,198
grow in bulk and get bigger in size

394
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,519
ultimately influencing where you have

395
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,359
flowers being developed and ultimately

396
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,039
dictating the amount of yield

397
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,519
you get at the end of the cycle so the

398
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,439
vegetative cycle and maximizing it is

399
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,360
very important for cannabis

400
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,639
so we've gone from propagation we've now

401
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,680
transplanted we've gone through

402
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,399
vegetative growth

403
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,879
we've kept both production stages under

404
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,159
the same crop developmental stage

405
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,000
by applying long days now we do what's

406
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,159
called flipping of the photo period

407
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,039
all we do is we reduce the amount of

408
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,838
light hours

409
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,039
from 18 to 12 and what does that do it

410
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,839
extends

411
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,719
the length of the night right this and

412
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,920
short day plants

413
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,120
triggers them into flower initiation or

414
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,958
into a reproductive state and then as

415
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,159
you see here on week six we start to

416
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,439
initiate flowering

417
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,120
and depending on whether you're a

418
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,880
marijuana grower trying to produce as

419
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,039
much thc as possible

420
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,120
or you're a hemp grower that is trying

421
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,278
to push the limits with cbd why

422
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,078
while still making sure that you stay

423
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,759
compliant with 0.3 total thc

424
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,120
you would then take your cannabinoid

425
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,839
test throughout this

426
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,759
flower development part of the cycle and

427
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,839
that would influence when you ultimately

428
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,800
harvest this crop

429
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,120
so with that basic schedule understood

430
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,198
for

431
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,600
indoor production of cannabis or hemp

432
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,439
let's look at some pictures that have

433
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,879
been grown under a very similar schedule

434
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,160
so the picture that i just

435
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,600
brought up here this is an example of

436
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,919
what's called a sea of green

437
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,040
okay and so i wonder if my mouse will

438
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,278
work it will so

439
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,879
most likely they had two weeks if not

440
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,679
three whatever it took to root the

441
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,240
plants

442
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,638
they had that same duration as part of

443
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,440
what we see here on this example

444
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,519
but what they did is they didn't allow

445
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,839
the plants to get very big

446
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,679
before they flowered them and that could

447
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,519
be due to the regulations per

448
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,758
state if they're required to have a

449
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,600
certain amount of plant count

450
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,039
versus taking up amount of space

451
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,360
whatever it may be

452
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,719
they've chosen to have more plants per

453
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,399
their area

454
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,720
with less amount of a vegetative

455
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,440
cycle throughout that that production

456
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,639
cycle

457
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,160
so what they've done is they've

458
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,879
transplanted these plants that have

459
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,519
rooted

460
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,399
and they have a very high density

461
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,159
planting

462
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,759
that they give a very short window of

463
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,719
vegetative growth so the plants don't

464
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,120
get too big

465
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,839
and then they initiate flowering and

466
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,120
that's how you have a sea of green

467
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,399
in this example which i hope you can see

468
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,879
i could have cropped it a little better

469
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,679
but you can see that each individual

470
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,759
plant is

471
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,519
much larger than the plants over here in

472
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,919
the sea of green example

473
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
and what this shows us is that they did

474
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,959
the same thing

475
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,318
most likely they propagated these plants

476
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,400
in two to three weeks

477
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,519
they then transplanted them into much

478
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,720
larger pots

479
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,798
spaced them at much wider spacing

480
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,558
and they gave these plants a longer

481
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,759
vegetative cycle to build

482
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:27,119
mass on these plants and so

483
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,679
most likely this scenario has used the

484
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,279
two

485
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,798
has used the three to four week

486
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,038
vegetative period

487
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,240
versus here that most likely used one if

488
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,919
not one and a half to

489
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,759
maybe two weeks and it shows you the

490
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,679
difference in plant size

491
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,319
and ultimately it will influence the

492
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,840
yield per plant

493
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,839
all of what you see is dictated based on

494
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,879
understanding the photoperiodic nature

495
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,959
of cannabis

496
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
and how you manipulate its light cycles

497
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:01,519
all right so let's move on to

498
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,279
discussing production of cannabis

499
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,798
outdoors

500
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,399
this is where the hip mind gets quite

501
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,279
passionate because obviously we are a

502
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,640
hemp company

503
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,399
and our main target customer is a field

504
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,759
farmer we are working very closely with

505
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,759
greenhouse customers

506
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,079
but we ourselves are vertically

507
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,839
integrated we grow 60 acres of hemp on

508
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,918
we're on our third year now

509
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,240
and so we want to offer as much

510
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,520
technical support to field farmers as

511
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,440
possible

512
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,359
for one knowing the risk that we're all

513
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,279
taking going into this from the start

514
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,558
as well as understanding how volatile

515
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,918
the market value

516
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:40,480
of the final product is okay

517
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,480
so let's look at the map itself

518
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,880
so once this video was published you

519
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,400
will have a

520
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,000
tab on our website that is labeled as

521
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,679
hpm the hemp planting map we have here a

522
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,599
good description high level on how to

523
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,960
use it what to look for

524
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,519
and the purpose of the map but

525
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,679
ultimately this video is meant to show

526
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,000
you how to use it

527
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,160
i do want to shout out to joanne logan

528
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,558
at the university of tennessee

529
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,640
she was the climatologist that helped us

530
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,480
compile all of the data for this map and

531
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,240
also helped us put it into a

532
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,160
functional and interactive format so

533
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,279
thank you very much joanne for helping

534
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,038
us do this

535
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:26,639
and make this data available to farmers

536
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:28,319
so let's step back for a second and

537
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,840
we talked about an indoor crop schedule

538
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,480
we talked about the importance

539
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,199
of applying long days right to help the

540
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,038
plant

541
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,038
uh bulk in size um in

542
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,079
in the field you don't have the ability

543
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:41,679
to manipulate

544
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,839
lighting like you do in a greenhouse or

545
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,120
an indoor environment so you have to

546
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,199
strategically

547
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,558
plan your production outdoors so that

548
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,640
you maximize

549
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,480
the environment at the location where

550
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,440
you are

551
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,200
so with this said there are key

552
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,160
environmental factors that you should

553
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,480
think about

554
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,759
when determining when to plant at your

555
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,960
location

556
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,960
and these are your frost date or excuse

557
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,120
me your frost potential

558
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,000
the date at these different frost

559
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,119
potentials

560
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,960
and the day length okay so let's dive

561
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,279
into the map itself

562
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,558
as you can see if you press and drag it

563
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,279
is interactive

564
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,480
okay and all of these different dots

565
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,759
that you see

566
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,400
on the map are specific locations that

567
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,480
have environmental data tied to them

568
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,400
so for the sake of this example let's

569
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,360
look at lansing michigan

570
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,240
so i'd zoom in and you can press and

571
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,359
drag

572
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,839
right and let's click on i believe this

573
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,639
is

574
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,240
lansing so east lansing it gives you

575
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,480
some basic information in this data

576
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,000
table so it shows the latitude longitude

577
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,720
elevation the state

578
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,919
the city name but let's expand it so we

579
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,079
can wrap our heads around

580
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,840
what is the valuable data at this

581
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,720
location

582
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,759
so what you see here on the left it says

583
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,558
date

584
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,798
and then it has a percentage okay the

585
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,038
date right here is may 15th

586
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,480
but what's important to understand is

587
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,519
the percentage here

588
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,960
this is the potential of frost and so

589
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,679
we've given it to you pretty much from

590
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,200
100

591
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,159
to 10 so at 90 chance of frost in

592
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,880
michigan

593
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,919
the date would be april 12th but then

594
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,880
you would have a 10

595
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,440
chance of frost on may 15th and so it

596
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,120
shows you

597
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,200
kind of the potential of frost because

598
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,759
as we all know the last thing you want

599
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,159
to do is plant too early

600
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,879
especially clones and the frost come

601
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,919
through and

602
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,880
kill all of your plants and so then if

603
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,840
we scroll down

604
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,559
we understand the date that correlates

605
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,279
with the

606
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,399
frost potential now let's figure out the

607
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,558
day length

608
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,000
so you come down to 10 chance of frost

609
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,119
which we had up here

610
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,558
and we see dl this is day length

611
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:59,359
and so um on may 15th

612
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,558
we have 10 chance of frost and also on

613
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:04,719
may 15th

614
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:08,879
we have um a day length of 14 hours

615
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,679
and then 65 out of a hundred

616
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,720
regarding minutes and so let me dive in

617
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,038
a little bit deeper

618
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,839
to explain to you how you should look at

619
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,960
this

620
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,119
specific data point so that we we

621
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,720
totally grasp what it's saying about

622
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,479
photo period and the date length

623
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,640
so let me highlight this so that we're

624
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,000
all on the same page

625
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,200
um so on may 15th we have a 10

626
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,279
chance of frost but our day length as

627
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,360
notated here on the hemp mine

628
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:44,319
planting map is 14 hours 0.65

629
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,959
okay what does this mean it means that

630
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:50,079
we have

631
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:53,120
14 hours plus 65 of an additional hour

632
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:56,639
for how we had to format this we

633
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:58,479
couldn't make the 0.65 be minutes we had

634
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,000
to make it be a percentage of an

635
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,440
additional hour

636
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,079
so let's just break this down really

637
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,640
simply so it's not confusing

638
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,079
since it is a percentage let's turn this

639
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,159
into a pie chart

640
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,720
and in this case we could think of a

641
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,679
clock as a pie chart right because in a

642
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,038
clock

643
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:20,480
60 minutes equals 100 percent

644
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:24,798
and so what is 65

645
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,519
of a full hour 39 minutes

646
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,720
so there we go that tells us that this

647
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,480
photo period

648
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,360
is 14 hours and 39 minutes because 39

649
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,038
minutes

650
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,439
is 65 of one hour

651
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:42,000
okay so now that we understand this

652
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,960
let's look at two practical examples the

653
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
first one being

654
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,720
in lansing michigan like i showed before

655
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,840
and the second one being

656
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,839
in alexandria louisiana

657
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,880
all right so same location you can see

658
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,519
here in the clip

659
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,480
at the bottom right that i i chose the

660
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,558
exact same

661
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,000
data box that we were just looking at

662
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:05,119
when looking at the interactive hemp

663
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,880
planting map

664
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,479
i've put it into a format so that we can

665
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,520
run through this example pretty pretty

666
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,558
quickly

667
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,918
so what i have here up on the left is it

668
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,079
shows frost potential

669
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,440
the day length the year week as some

670
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,759
growers use that

671
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,759
and then also just the day the day of

672
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,640
the year okay

673
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,400
in this scenario if we were working with

674
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,240
a farmer in lansing michigan

675
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,679
and that farmer wanted to plant southern

676
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,240
cat daddy for outdoor

677
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,759
field smokable flower production we

678
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,880
would go about

679
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:39,519
recommending when he plant based on

680
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,080
this exact example right here southern

681
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:45,359
cat daddy has a flowering response time

682
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:48,079
of 14 hours right so that means that

683
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,000
any day length longer than 14 hours will

684
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,480
ensure that it stays vegetative

685
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,798
and any day length shorter than 14 hours

686
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,759
will trigger it into flower initiation

687
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,200
okay so we want to plant we want to make

688
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,038
sure that we plant when the day length

689
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,720
is longer than 14 hours

690
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,400
so that it can focus on vegetative

691
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,278
growth and continue that growth

692
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,440
throughout the majority of the season

693
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:13,200
and get bigger and bigger and bigger

694
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:17,600
so over here i show frost potential

695
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,840
and i started on april 29th

696
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,519
april 29th we have a photo period of 14

697
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,759
hours this is right at the line

698
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,278
right so i would not recommend planting

699
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,000
it 14 hours as that

700
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,319
is this cultivar's flowering response

701
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,480
time

702
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,319
exactly it would go into flower if

703
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,519
planted april 29th

704
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:38,000
also you have a 60 chance of frost

705
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,240
with the risk and investment that you're

706
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,679
taking up front anyway with this crop do

707
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,079
you also want to risk frost

708
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,000
i don't think so so we would not

709
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,240
recommend planting in michigan

710
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,679
in lansing southern cat daddy on april

711
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,120
29th

712
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,679
we then would say okay what's our next

713
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:57,038
best option we go a week later we have

714
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,840
may 6th photo period has increased

715
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,679
19 minutes so we could actually plant

716
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,879
southern cat daddy because now the day

717
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,400
length is longer

718
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,320
than 14 hours and it would stay

719
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,679
vegetative however

720
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,798
we have a 14 excuse me 40 percent chance

721
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,960
of frost

722
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,558
i again would say hey no we're not

723
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,798
risking it yet

724
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,960
what's our next option and so then you

725
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:22,798
see here we have twenty percent chance

726
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,120
uh may 13th 14 hours and 47 minutes

727
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,400
definitely long enough to plant but for

728
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,479
the sake of this example

729
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,519
i would recommend okay at 10 percent

730
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,038
chance of frost

731
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,720
let's get these plants in the ground

732
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:33,839
your day length is definitely long

733
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,679
enough

734
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,038
this is at the end of may let's not

735
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,840
waste any more time

736
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,480
time to get the plants in the ground

737
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,199
then

738
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,960
once plants are planted they're growing

739
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,400
they're establishing they're focusing on

740
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,319
vegetative growth

741
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,320
you have a natural distribution of

742
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,918
day length throughout the year right so

743
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,879
in the in the spring it

744
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,480
it slowly gets longer and then as you

745
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,559
hit the solstice

746
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,400
it peaks and then the day lengths get

747
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,399
shorter as you go into fall

748
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,480
and so if we follow that throughout the

749
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,120
season the plant stays vegetative

750
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,839
and initiates flowering when daylinks

751
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:15,278
come back down to 14 hours

752
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,079
and so on august 12th southern cat daddy

753
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,278
would initiate

754
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,960
flowering in lansing michigan because

755
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,519
we've hit 14 hours

756
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,679
so in lansing michigan this is when i

757
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,558
would recommend to this farmer with this

758
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,399
cultivar

759
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,960
when to plant because this would allow

760
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,519
them to have 11 weeks of vegetative grow

761
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,759
time

762
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,918
this would allow the plants to to really

763
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,759
fill out in size

764
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,200
and it truly should dictate the amount

765
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,000
of plants they plant per

766
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,960
acre based on the amount of vegetative

767
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,839
growth time that they do have

768
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,919
so now let's look at the exact same

769
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,720
cultivar

770
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,520
in louisiana a much more southern

771
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,640
latitude

772
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,440
in the city of alexandria louisiana so

773
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,278
we would look at the

774
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,360
the data from the map right here just

775
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,038
showed another shows another screenshot

776
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,240
of it

777
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,798
thankfully we don't have to worry too

778
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,679
much about frost but the day lengths

779
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:11,599
are much shorter than they are in

780
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,798
michigan at the same dates

781
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:16,000
so again i reference the same week week

782
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,960
17 the same

783
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,200
date april 29th we have 10 chance of

784
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,960
frost not a big concern however our day

785
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,159
length is really short at 13 hours and

786
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,840
21 minutes

787
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,679
definitely do not want to plant southern

788
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,798
cat daddy would prematurely go into

789
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,278
flower

790
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,119
so we would recommend that they actually

791
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,599
plant june 3rd

792
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,319
because your day length is right over 14

793
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,480
hours

794
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,319
and we would hope that this would ensure

795
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,839
that it stays vegetative if not planting

796
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,319
a little later

797
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,519
however their natural distribution of

798
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,480
long days peaks

799
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,558
and falls much sooner than what we saw

800
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,640
in michigan

801
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:55,038
and their plant southern cat daddy would

802
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,520
go into flower initiation on july

803
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:01,839
first and so in louisiana with the exact

804
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,200
same cultivar

805
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,879
you would have only three weeks of

806
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,519
vegetative growth this plant would be

807
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,080
much

808
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,599
smaller than the plants in michigan

809
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,678
however keep in mind

810
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,038
they're the same cost and most likely

811
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,320
other breeding companies are

812
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,720
recommending that you plant them at the

813
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,918
same crop density as well

814
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:24,159
that's not how we should do this

815
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:26,000
so what the hemp mine would do is

816
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,320
knowing all of this data going into it

817
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,960
also knowing the objective of your

818
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,960
production

819
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,440
and what final product you want to offer

820
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,880
to the market and when

821
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,558
we would allow you to

822
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,000
understand this like we do through this

823
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,359
kind of example but

824
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,240
offer a solution that would match

825
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,158
a similar grow time in louisiana to the

826
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,759
farmer in michigan and how do we do that

827
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,320
we do that through offering

828
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:55,679
a different cultivar that has a shorter

829
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,759
flowering response time

830
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,600
so in michigan this is the example of

831
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,640
southern cat daddy 11 weeks

832
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:05,918
pretty much of vegetative growth time

833
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,440
in louisiana only three so what we would

834
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,159
do is we would recommend a cultivar

835
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,360
named southern

836
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,120
sunset to lower latitude states and in

837
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,959
alexandria louisiana

838
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,959
it would allow this farmer

839
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,960
to have this vegetative crop schedule

840
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,880
instead of the three-week southern cat

841
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,640
daddy vegetative crop schedule

842
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,799
and that's because southern sunset has a

843
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,480
response time of 13 hours

844
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:34,720
and 20 minutes not 14 hours

845
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,880
so now the grower in louisiana can be

846
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,278
competitive in plant size and yield per

847
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,799
acre when planting the same crop density

848
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:45,839
as the farmer in michigan this data

849
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,720
dictates when to plant crop density per

850
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:49,278
acre ultimately

851
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,000
what genetics you should choose and when

852
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:52,640
ultimately to

853
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,440
start testing because this is when the

854
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,480
plants will

855
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,480
go into flower initiation

856
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,399
and so from here is when you should

857
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,079
count down

858
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:03,278
pretty much to harvest and when you

859
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,000
should start taking your first

860
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,880
cannabinoid

861
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,839
tests on week one two or three after

862
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,840
flower initiation

863
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:15,200
so this chart just shows you

864
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,360
the response time of each of our

865
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,000
cultivars we will expand on this we're

866
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,359
coming out with

867
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,240
a new catalog for 2021 um

868
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,558
and we will elaborate on on this more

869
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,919
with

870
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:32,398
actually having more cultivars as well

871
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,600
we

872
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:38,558
work very closely with a lab parture lab

873
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,519
partner excuse me kacho labs and with

874
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,798
them

875
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,798
we are able to offer our customers

876
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,079
discounts on cannabinoid tests because

877
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,319
we do recommend that you take

878
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,519
quite a few throughout the flower

879
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,720
development

880
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,960
production stage of your crop cycle

881
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,399
but ultimately what we would do for each

882
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,319
of our customers

883
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,918
is create a schedule like this for you

884
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,519
after we're on the same page with what

885
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,480
genetics you want to use for what

886
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,200
purpose

887
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,798
and at which location we create a crop

888
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,399
schedule for you helping you understand

889
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,000
okay when you need to plant

890
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:13,918
when these plants will go into flower

891
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,558
initiation and when you should start

892
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,840
testing

893
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,519
and give you all of the proper

894
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,240
information for how to test how to

895
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,440
sample

896
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,440
where to send your samples all of that

897
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:30,558
okay so this concludes part one

898
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,558
of photoperiodism

899
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,120
part 2 will be coming soon we will

900
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,159
release this before the

901
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,798
end of 2020 so stay tuned

902
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,080
for dr justice as we will dive a little

903
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,038
deeper into

904
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,879
the flowering physiology of cannabis

905
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,960
during our 2020 field trials we have

906
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,640
noticed some very interesting responses

907
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,840
which are leading us to expand

908
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,840
our short day plant understanding even

909
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,839
further
