[Music]

2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:20,368
the tournament when a plant is ready or

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:22,920
the indicators of harvest time so I'm

4
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:24,689
looking for both the pistols and the

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,240
trichomes will begin to change color as

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,820
the plant matures and gets closer to

7
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,098
harvest and the plant itself will start

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,619
to lose energy you'll notice change of

9
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,629
color and some of the leaves a lot of

10
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:39,238
the big families will start to wither

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,980
turn yellow as the plant kind of

12
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,640
withdraws and nutrients out of those and

13
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:46,890
basically sheds them in a way and then

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,859
the plant itself will just start to lose

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:54,780
energy and start to lose momentum when

16
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,448
you first go into flower you see it

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,429
build real quickly into that push and

18
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:03,539
then as it gets towards the end that

19
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:06,359
energy backs way off the pistols and

20
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,150
trichomes will will shift from the

21
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,819
trichomes are generally a clear early

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,868
then turn milky and then will start to

23
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:20,129
oxidize turn orange dark and tan on the

24
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:23,489
outside when you start to see a ratio of

25
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:26,250
about 8020 with the pistols which do the

26
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:30,390
same thing go from a light a white color

27
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:34,489
or I shouldn't say that they're not all

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:37,950
white but they'll go from a live healthy

29
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:40,589
moisture present to dry withered and

30
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,590
often in a darker color the moist is the

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,469
new growth and you'll start to see the

32
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,180
plant slow down the new pistols emerging

33
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:50,478
will slow down and slow down and slow

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,799
down the old ones will wither and

35
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,868
eventually what ends up happening is you

36
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,490
end up with different ratios early into

37
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:58,109
flower you should if the plant is

38
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:01,798
healthy you'll have close to 100 percent

39
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:07,408
of the pistols are a lighter color and

40
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,868
alive and actively emerging and then as

41
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,580
that slows down and the old ones started

42
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:16,060
to turn dark the new ones will

43
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:19,090
as well the new emergence will slow down

44
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,750
and eventually what you end up with is

45
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:27,099
the majority of them are dead or dry and

46
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:29,620
and withered and so the the to changing

47
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:32,590
color and kind of the ratios the

48
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,469
percentages that you find are what you

49
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,960
lead you into the question of you know

50
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:40,419
is it time to harvest so when it comes

51
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,240
time to harvest often the manner of the

52
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:46,449
harvest depends on the plant it's done

53
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,270
differently indoors the greenhouses and

54
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:51,459
outdoor scenarios depending on how big

55
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,230
that plant was usually for me is the

56
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,710
determining factor you know what method

57
00:02:53,229 --> 00:03:00,069
you might consider you can go in and

58
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:03,909
take the whole planet down and just hang

59
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:06,280
the entire plant with some of the bigger

60
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:09,009
ones what you'll see is that the flowers

61
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,099
mature on the outside before they mature

62
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:15,239
on the inside so the things down on the

63
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:18,719
inside branches below the colas will be

64
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:22,870
sometimes a week behind week and a half

65
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:25,750
and if you take the tops off of big

66
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:28,060
plants first and then allow that inside

67
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,430
to mature a little bit in my experience

68
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,939
you end up with a higher yield you can

69
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,890
do two is obviously the starting point

70
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:39,209
if you're going more than one I've seen

71
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:41,919
it done as many as four and five times I

72
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,110
think when you start to get into five

73
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:48,219
cuts on the same plant that's not

74
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:50,650
necessarily viable commercially but I

75
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:54,120
think a first harvest on the outside of

76
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,800
some of the big plants is and and

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,629
increases your yield and can increase

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,300
the quality of the material down on the

79
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:03,069
inside if you allow that access to

80
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,560
sunlight before taking it so you take

81
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:08,079
the tops off and D leaf a little bit the

82
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,449
outside of the plant again and allow

83
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,830
that light to get in and penetrate down

84
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:14,709
into some of that stuff that hasn't

85
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,810
really seen light you'll notice that

86
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,970
they get more dense a lot of times

87
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,850
they'll put on mass they'll continue to

88
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,940
grow and a lot of times what you'll find

89
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,379
is that when the when the outside colas

90
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:29,350
specifically are ready

91
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:33,579
harvest if you look down inside that

92
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:35,470
stuff still has a ways to go all the

93
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:38,169
pistols will be the the pistols will

94
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,700
tend to be fresher younger continuing to

95
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:44,770
emerge or appearing to continue to

96
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:47,769
emerge very few dry withered compared to

97
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:51,069
the outsides and and the trichomes as

98
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:53,889
well and generally be behind the the

99
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:58,060
outside behind the colas the outside of

100
00:04:53,889 --> 00:05:03,310
the plant generally aid the key I think

101
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,569
for the curing of it is is controlling

102
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,850
the temperature and humidity in the room

103
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:09,219
and trying to keep that as stable as

104
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,660
possible fluctuations in temperature and

105
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,030
humidity are what begins to turn the

106
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,220
plant colors and a lot of cases you'll

107
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:18,369
start to see things will tan off if they

108
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,950
were if they were taking on a little bit

109
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,600
too hard of a ride what you want to try

110
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,310
and do is is bring the temperature and

111
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,350
humidity of the plant material kind of

112
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:31,839
down down down up down and and kind of

113
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,200
slide it in rather than just all the

114
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,669
humidity out and then continue to drain

115
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,399
off what continues to come out of the

116
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,590
plant material for a few days the drying

117
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,839
of the material will take a little bit

118
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:45,519
too hard of a dip and a lot of times

119
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,509
what you'll do is you'll dip below the

120
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:53,079
threshold for the Cure which is if I

121
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:55,149
remember correctly is 50% and so if you

122
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,370
drop that plant material below 50%

123
00:05:55,149 --> 00:06:00,849
humidity that curing process stops and

124
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:03,430
what you have is a dried material often

125
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,470
the difference between that drying it

126
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,840
versus kind of curing it versus slowly

127
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,950
withdrawing the the last bits of

128
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:15,039
moisture out the differences is often

129
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:17,229
found in the smoke the the young studs

130
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,750
of the flash dried is I tend to refer to

131
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:24,040
it the flash dried stuff you tend to get

132
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:26,470
a little bit harsher smoke and the THC

133
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,319
to kind of changes the experience as it

134
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,750
matures it softens it mellows the

135
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,639
experience a little bit especially with

136
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,418
some of the sativa stuff it can get you

137
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,860
really racy very uplifting but a lot of

138
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:40,269
times that can be a little bit

139
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,060
much with some of the strains that we

140
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:45,389
have now being so incredibly high and

141
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,389
THC

142
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,220
it'll-it'll softened that I guess

143
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:55,329
similar to the way that they aged

144
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:58,090
tobacco or wine with wines you know that

145
00:06:55,329 --> 00:07:01,500
there's a sharper flavor in my

146
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:04,869
experience has been is kind of a sharper

147
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,370
tint to the to the young stuff and then

148
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,680
as you get older it gets kind of

149
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,129
smoother more refined and that seemed

150
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,079
type of thing happens with the THC which

151
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:15,819
with cannabis for the Cure the

152
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,060
temperature and humidity controlling the

153
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:20,920
temperature and humidity of the room

154
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,870
it's kind of the biggest priority for me

155
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,720
is watching that temperature and

156
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,870
humidity in the room not necessarily in

157
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,080
the plant material but in the room so as

158
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,870
you first load up a cure space or a dry

159
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:38,050
space and that fresh plant material will

160
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:40,840
be will be shedding moisture very very

161
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,360
quickly so your humidity will shoot up

162
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:46,599
and it will stay high for usually 2 3 4

163
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,420
days during that stage I take the

164
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,060
community out as fast as possible and

165
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,310
then as that starts to slow down I will

166
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,189
back off the speed at which I'm pulling

167
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,660
the humidity out of the room and that

168
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:02,969
kind of allows the plant material to

169
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:06,340
shed the moisture and a little bit more

170
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,320
drawn-out drawing out that that that

171
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:11,769
drying process was the process of

172
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,839
shedding the moisture and what I'm

173
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:16,389
trying to avoid is just kind of a crash

174
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,339
and in humidity sucking it out too fast

175
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,229
and a lot of times what you'll end up

176
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:22,060
doing is you'll dry it too fast it'll

177
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:25,150
become crispy you'll drop below the

178
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,339
threshold of 50% and once you once you

179
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:28,539
drop below that threshold my

180
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:31,149
understanding of the process is that

181
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,759
that's when the curing stops and once it

182
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:35,470
stops there's no restarting it so in

183
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,590
order the difference between drying it

184
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:41,860
and curing it is maintaining maintaining

185
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,970
a minimum of 55 50 % humidity in the

186
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,539
material

187
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:50,149
and drawing it out slowly along gating

188
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:52,250
that process a bit drawing out that

189
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:55,189
process ends up with a higher quality

190
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,190
product pure space temperature I tend to

191
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,050
keep it as low as most AC systems will

192
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,360
allow which seems to be in the mid to

193
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:03,949
high 50s and then as I'm drawing out the

194
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,930
humidity the only other real concern

195
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,150
that I have is airflow in the room

196
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:10,459
keeping the humidity within that room

197
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:14,389
consistent throughout the room not

198
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:17,720
having higher humidity down low hot dry

199
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:22,340
air up top you'll you'll end up with an

200
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:25,879
uneven uneven cure if I'm able to hold

201
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:30,230
the room for a few days at 55% humidity

202
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:32,689
that's kind of a I've had my best

203
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,519
results that way if I'm able to draw

204
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,020
that process out and finish by being

205
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,720
able to hold the temperature in humidity

206
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:40,639
in the room temperature low and

207
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,080
consistent from start to finish or as

208
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,879
close to consistence I can get from

209
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,530
start to finish and then the humidity

210
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:48,710
drawing that out quickly to beginning

211
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:50,809
slowing it way way way down and and then

212
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,750
that last few days of the process I

213
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:56,089
should be able to if I'm on top of

214
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,309
things and in a easily controlled

215
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,960
environment I should be able to take

216
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:01,429
that last few days and just hold the

217
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,379
room right where it is and allow the

218
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:04,909
last little bit of humidity to kind of

219
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:06,860
make its way from the inside of the

220
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:09,769
flower to the outside out into the air

221
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,759
and then if you're able to get that

222
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:15,860
whole space to hold that 55% humidity

223
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,330
for that extra day or two days what

224
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,830
you're doing is kind of evening

225
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,360
everything out so if there are parts

226
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,000
that dry it a little bit faster than

227
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,620
others that last little bit of humidity

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,169
is going to continue to work itself out

229
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:30,049
of the dense the the more dense material

230
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:32,750
and you'll end up with a more consistent

231
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:35,479
humidity throughout so the outside of

232
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:38,240
the flower will be roughly 55% 60%

233
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,159
humidity and inside will be the same

234
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:47,240
versus the outside being outside being

235
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:50,088
40% humidity or 35% humidity or or even

236
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,769
50% humidity and the inside is still in

237
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:55,850
the 60s or 70s

238
00:10:51,769 --> 00:11:00,558
you know ten to ten ten to 20 points

239
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:02,540
higher on the inside for for that first

240
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:04,698
stage of the cure the cure can be broken

241
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:06,409
into stages you don't necessarily have

242
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:09,729
to keep the entire process in your

243
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:13,610
drying space or in your in your initial

244
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,319
in your kind of initial care space you

245
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,470
can if you can draw that process the

246
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:21,349
first step of the process out to 1012

247
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:26,540
days that seems to be a very easily

248
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:28,928
achievable target where if you draw it

249
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:31,099
out too long then you're just allowing

250
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:32,928
you know that stuff to kind of sit out

251
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,790
in the air a little bit longer than

252
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:37,789
needed

253
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:40,578
you then break it down break it down

254
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:42,409
into bins and you can kind of slow walk

255
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:45,558
the remainder of the process there by

256
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:47,448
just checking the bins on occasion

257
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:50,269
closing them up and allowing that

258
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:51,859
humidity in the bin to even out keeping

259
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:53,568
track obviously what that is and if

260
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,318
there's still a little bit more humidity

261
00:11:53,568 --> 00:12:00,318
to escape you can burp the lids on

262
00:11:57,318 --> 00:12:03,128
occasion there are a handful of ways to

263
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:06,409
to go into that second stage of cure

264
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:08,869
what's been I think very popular for a

265
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:11,600
very long time now on what's been more

266
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:14,028
of the hobbyist scale compared to you

267
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,399
know we're now expanding into full-scale

268
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:19,129
commercial production type facilities

269
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,558
but in the history of Canada the last 60

270
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:23,240
years the history of cannabis at least

271
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:25,278
it's been underground and on a small

272
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,249
scale which makes it to where large

273
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,769
mason jars or five-gallon buckets

274
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:34,100
sealable containers and that size work

275
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:36,740
well for the second stage of cure you

276
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,329
want I tend to go towards food grade

277
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,519
material you don't necessarily just want

278
00:12:38,328 --> 00:12:42,888
to go grab a Home Depot bucket I think

279
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,328
that the the smells the off-gassing of

280
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,629
the manufacturing process and the

281
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:50,958
plastics can work its way into the flour

282
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:54,769
material but any sort of food grade

283
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:57,078
plastic or glass in anything mason jar

284
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:59,418
up to maybe a five-gallon as you scale

285
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:03,138
that up you start to start to look at

286
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:05,340
things like 55-gallon drums that can be

287
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,779
just rotated on a rack

288
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,470
a little bit at a time to kind of keep

289
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:12,029
that material moving if there is any

290
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,500
humidity left you don't want it all

291
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,819
sinking to the bottom you want

292
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,909
everything in there to kind of cure

293
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:23,070
evenly so you can turn that 55 gallon

294
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:25,829
bucket 55-gallon drum on a rack it's

295
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:32,640
similar to what you see with you know

296
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:34,710
whiskey the barrels yeah on its side it

297
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,559
seems like the key to longer-term

298
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,450
storage is in temperature and humidity

299
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:42,509
levels being maintained but also

300
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:45,990
removing the oxygen from the equation so

301
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:48,689
storing in vacuum sealed or nitrogen

302
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,149
sealed bags similar to the way they

303
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:55,230
store you know a lot of things in the

304
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:57,870
market in the supermarket more often

305
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,940
than not what I see is a rush to get

306
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,879
paid that causes people to skip that

307
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,020
last step and so assuming you've gotten

308
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,879
all the way to the finish line and you

309
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:11,449
have clean healthy material the the the

310
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:16,259
most common way people kind of lose that

311
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:18,120
quality level that I found is in the

312
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:20,460
drying process and then storage

313
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,679
transportation any sort of heat and

314
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,389
humidity fluctuations will cause that

315
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,269
material to start to turn the color

316
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:31,080
first and smell let's just say both will

317
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:32,809
go usually hand-in-hand depending on how

318
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,930
that material is treated if it's not

319
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:40,739
it's not treated well after harvest you

320
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:44,879
lose value so if you had something that

321
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:47,190
may sell for $1,000 a pound now the

322
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,080
smell is kind of diminished and the

323
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,640
appearance is starting to turn a little

324
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,860
bit there's there's a little bit more

325
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,980
color it's not a clean green dried

326
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:59,310
material or cured material it starts to

327
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,379
tan turn various shades of yellow orange

328
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:06,149
tint will start to come into the trail

329
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:10,250
and and then the smell will also start

330
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:13,799
to diminish or turn into something else

331
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:16,169
a lot of times you'll be able to

332
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,748
really tell from from the smell

333
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:21,360
specifically what's happening was it was

334
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:24,869
the material cured properly stored

335
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,379
properly or was it put away wet will

336
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:32,670
create a little bit a different scent

337
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:36,769
than if it was beaten up while it was

338
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:38,878
still alive and then properly cured

339
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:46,169
things like that so you'll start to see

340
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:49,139
the quality level diminish and and in a

341
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:51,088
lot of cases it seems the dot is due to

342
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,329
kind of a rush to get to market rush to

343
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:58,200
get paid and in that rush you end up

344
00:15:54,328 --> 00:16:07,178
taking less on the material

345
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:07,179
