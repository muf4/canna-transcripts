1
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,289
and so that's why we got a you know

2
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,118
improve our scientific literacy we have

3
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,919
to seek out people who understand the

4
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,980
science we have to encourage them to

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,630
speak in our community to share their

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,399
knowledge and to break it down in ways

7
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:35,009
that are understandable to empower

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,439
everybody in the community

9
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:39,179
Philo's has significantly damaged the

10
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,640
trust of our community with genomics

11
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,640
labs we can't let what Philo's did

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,480
actually impact the science people have

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,100
to continue to engage in the science

14
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:54,299
understand it and deploy it in ways that

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,609
are intentional and conscious we need to

16
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:59,698
control these technologies and deploy

17
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:02,158
them for our ends not have them deployed

18
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:05,569
by others against us in ways that make

19
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:08,579
it so that we no longer have any choices

20
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:10,139
we need to support people who have the

21
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,519
knowledge and expertise within our

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,200
community I've already mentioned that

23
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:18,629
one that's really where it's at we have

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,359
to go back to our roots and we have to

25
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:24,030
really focus on these educational

26
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,129
opportunities and understand that what

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,170
we're doing in these moments and in

28
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,659
these spaces is building culture and

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,170
we're building resilience to a culture

30
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,379
that we are all we've inherited and we

31
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,960
are also responsible for taking on into

32
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:42,509
the future and so we have to have events

33
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,669
like this we have to come together we

34
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:47,100
have to share this on social media we

35
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,299
have to get out there so that everybody

36
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:53,309
in our community that decided for

37
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,429
whatever reason from all our different

38
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,879
backgrounds to say cannabis that's my

39
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,680
thing I'm about it we need to be about

40
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:05,519
it now more than ever because if we're

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,800
not 5 10 years from now I mean according

42
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,799
to Mowgli home straight up their plan is

43
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,889
to be at market in 9 months and in 2

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,489
years have all existing cannabis

45
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:21,238
varieties be a thing of the past those

46
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:23,340
are his words now is it hubris is it

47
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,489
something that is probably not going to

48
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,598
happen certainly that you know best laid

49
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:33,450
plans often fail that said we have to

50
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:35,339
expect monsanto's of the world the

51
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:37,798
Syngenta's and anybody who wants to

52
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,348
adopt that model to come into our space

53
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:42,329
and to bring their a-game and we've seen

54
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:44,848
what they've done to everything else and

55
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:47,599
the only way that anything has ever

56
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:50,818
developed along a different trajectory

57
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,238
was because people consciously chose to

58
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,979
do so and because they organized around

59
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:00,030
things that they valued and their

60
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:02,729
culture in specific places across time

61
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,919
and they developed these institutions

62
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:07,408
and they got networked so that they

63
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:11,188
actually could build the resistance the

64
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:12,899
only reason that train that was if I had

65
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:17,128
the graphic at which I could show it but

66
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,829
basically 1903 we had hundreds of

67
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:22,438
varieties of every major crops Oh peas

68
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:24,659
melons tomatoes corns every single one

69
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:27,318
of them there were hundreds of specific

70
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:31,348
varietals being grown across the country

71
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:34,649
they were regionally adapted specific

72
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:38,158
cultivars that were useful in their

73
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,289
particular area and while they may not

74
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,938
have had market share to where they were

75
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:44,128
growing

76
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:47,908
billions of bushels and making tons of

77
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:50,518
Monsanto like money they were actually

78
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:52,739
building and maintaining crop diversity

79
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,188
that had incredible value that we've

80
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:58,468
only now realized what was being lost in

81
00:03:56,188 --> 00:04:01,858
the 1980s when they went back and they

82
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:05,759
looked at what was available in the

83
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:08,219
existing crop germ plasm banks and it

84
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,378
was down to a handful of any one of

85
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:14,878
those crops so we went from hundreds to

86
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:17,459
about a dozen maybe two dozen that right

87
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:21,298
there is something that we can't let

88
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,988
happen Philo says that they have in

89
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,339
their catalog

90
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,138
four hundred varieties

91
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,209
so if we were to look at and have

92
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,639
cannabis in that chart you would have

93
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:32,310
cannabis with at least 400 distinct

94
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:35,699
varietals and their plan is to take

95
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:39,000
those 400 varietals and turn it into a

96
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:42,019
few dozen and have that be ubiquitous

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,120
and be the only thing anybody ever

98
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:47,729
experiences and gets to enjoy

99
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,709
that's not cannabis that's not what

100
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,569
we've dedicated our lives to that's not

101
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:54,509
why we fought the good fight and kept

102
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:58,769
these plants alive under wartime

103
00:04:54,509 --> 00:05:01,918
conditions we kept this plant alive and

104
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:03,899
we took all of this genetic resources

105
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,699
from all of these different places that

106
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:10,529
have been developed over millennia and

107
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:13,560
we did so not just to hand it over to a

108
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:16,949
bunch of suits and not just to give up

109
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,280
when the going got tough like or goings

110
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:23,089
been a lot tougher like they used to

111
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:26,668
show up with helicopters and guns way

112
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:29,879
it's getting marginally better they're

113
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:33,569
showing up with briefcases now but you

114
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:38,728
know we need to stay on it and just stay

115
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:41,668
true to ourselves I think just to get

116
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:44,250
into some broader like breeding genetics

117
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:47,339
things that need to happen okay us

118
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,750
quickly germ plasm maintenance

119
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,849
collecting storing and preserving

120
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,910
genetic diversity of isolated

121
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,280
populations and varietals is key you

122
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,340
need to take your plants you got to

123
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:02,909
plant two seeds or something okay pop

124
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:06,179
them do a seed increase make thousands

125
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:09,450
if you got one seed and it's a female

126
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,910
okay do a reversal make thousands out of

127
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,949
it because that is a genetic resource

128
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,070
and it's something that could otherwise

129
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,259
get lost if we don't make seed increases

130
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:21,949
constantly and we don't keep these

131
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:25,288
things isolated and within their own

132
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:28,620
niches because once we start crossing

133
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:30,959
everything together we have essentially

134
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,290
a race to the bottom and we lose the

135
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,329
unique diverse

136
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:38,830
that we have in specific varietals

137
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,870
further than that we need to get into

138
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:43,839
acclimatization and trait improvement

139
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,370
and the traditional landrace varieties

140
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,839
were the results of hundreds and

141
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,610
thousands of years of acclimatization

142
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,949
and selection pressures that were

143
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,020
exerted on plants by cultural complexes

144
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:55,629
that valued and cultivated them around

145
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:59,349
the world I've gotten I explained some

146
00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:01,149
of these before the plant as we know it

147
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,770
is the result of the choices made by the

148
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:04,389
different diverse cultures that

149
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:07,029
interacted with this plant over

150
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,279
millennia our tasks as breeders is to

151
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:11,619
keep in mind that our decisions impact

152
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,389
the gene pool of this plant in ways that

153
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,579
have consequences thousands of years

154
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,409
into the future since the inception of

155
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:19,599
modern hybrids there's been an emphasis

156
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,400
on primarily trait improvement for

157
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,920
increased yields reduced flower time

158
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,289
cannabinoids terpenes bud structure

159
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,060
morphology and appearance we've

160
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,100
accomplished incredible improvements in

161
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,019
the plant over this time period in a

162
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,600
very haphazard manner without the

163
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:36,459
benefits of advanced genomics or public

164
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,010
institutions that would support us in

165
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:42,009
our efforts literally under siege during

166
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,139
a drug war the result is that we have

167
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:46,060
lots of varietals that have been

168
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:48,669
significantly improved in a number of

169
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,100
ways however we focus less on

170
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,530
acclimatized stabilized in isolated

171
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,810
populations there are relatively few

172
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:58,839
acclimatized heirlooms and pure

173
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,209
unhybridized lines that and those that

174
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,369
do exist are incredibly cherished we

175
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:06,069
need to get back to that we need to get

176
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:09,540
back to staying in our lane staying in

177
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:12,399
our communities growing and developing

178
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,460
varietals and cultivars that are unique

179
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,769
to our areas and we need to do it on the

180
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:19,449
personal level personal cultivators

181
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:21,609
growing their six plants and being

182
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:23,439
heirloom preservationist creating

183
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,259
preservationist societies like the

184
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,509
Audubon Society where we actually really

185
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:30,579
get into this and have just hobbyists

186
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:33,840
who care only about cannabis and

187
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:36,759
describe in detail and develop their own

188
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,710
personal lines that is the thing

189
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,659
we need to be encouraging and developing

190
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,550
along with all of the commercial

191
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,039
developments that are going on and we

192
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:47,169
need for the commercial developments to

193
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,250
be developing what's being spoken about

194
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:52,000
right here

195
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:55,769
we need farmers and breeders to develop

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,559
an alliances with distributors and

197
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,939
buyers coops buyers co-ops and is

198
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,459
something that we as a community

199
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,130
developed in like the hippy back to the

200
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,889
land movement and it made the renewable

201
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:11,799
energy market a thing it made the health

202
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:14,710
food market a thing we can make heirloom

203
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:17,079
varieties in cannabis a thing that has

204
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,509
market share and market space if we

205
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,430
target every single side of the supply

206
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:23,679
chain and don't just look at you know

207
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:25,659

00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:40,269
been talking a lot about about this all

213
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:43,110
day you know the idea of genetic

214
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:46,240
diversity the idea of cultural diversity

215
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,600

growing their six plants and the

219
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:57,850
responsibility that we have by having

220
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,919
these genetics and carrying on the the

221
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,810
lineages here and for people such as

222

223
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:06,579
