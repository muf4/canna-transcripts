1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,219
[Music]

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,449
thank you

3
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:14,448
[Music]

4
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:20,640
because I gotta catch a plane but you

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,439
guys just finished a presentation we did

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,899
yeah and yeah

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,500
uh we're obviously talking blue mats

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,479
irrigation yeah so you want to take it

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,519
away yeah I do I mean it was we just

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,500
finished this presentation here I mean

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,760
it's been quite the weekend

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,320
um

13
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,359
thanks Peter

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,100
what it's been great hanging out this

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,378
weekend here so

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,280
it's so weird

17
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:46,259
the um

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,700
yeah you want to clip him in there

19
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,179
yeah so we did we just finished this

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,500
presentation and um

21
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:55,320
you know it was really like a joint

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,899
presentation between the three of us so

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,878
this is Cooper Didier I don't think he's

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,820
been on the show yet he's probably a

25
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:05,338
Garden Solutions on Instagram and uh

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,478
this is Izzy Becker he's also with us

27
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:08,700
too

28
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,219
um we're all we all actually work

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,939
together at sustainable Village

30
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:14,400
um

31
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,259
and I think Izzy's been on one of these

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,659
shows was that I don't think there's

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,000
this one yeah it was a different one but

34
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,280
you know the three of us were co-workers

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,319
and friends and

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,379
um we spend a lot of time hanging out

37
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,679
and talking about irrigation and soil

38
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:34,438
moisture yeah like

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,259
much of the Chagrin of our significant

40
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,779
others and things like that yeah far

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,819
more than we probably should be yeah

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,239
but but a lot of it's had to do with you

43
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,978
know with the blue mat irrigation and

44
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,118
um I'm kind of excited to like sit with

45
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,159
you guys and talk about it in this

46
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:51,659
format because what we just did

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,040
um in this moment in this presentation

48
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,540
we did we did we just did a whole

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,439
presentation on

50
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,140
how to measure soil moisture how to use

51
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,478
that data to influence irrigation events

52
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,259
and then how to actually use moisture

53
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:10,139
sensors like tensiometers to control

54
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:14,039
um actual irrigation systems so that was

55
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,939
kind of like the the gist of it and

56
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,378
um

57
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:20,039
you know we can kind of go into that we

58
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:22,318
basically talk about tensiometers I mean

59
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,959
like what are these things is he yeah I

60
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,639
mean so basically a tensiometer is one

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,920
of the simplest and most accurate ways

62
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,958
of measuring soil moisture still widely

63
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,759
used in most Research Laboratories to

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,680
this day and in most agricultural

65
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,799
irrigation controls it's like very

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,439
common so basically it's a ceramic tip

67
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,439
it's a body that has water in it and

68
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,539
it's a vacuum gauge soil is constantly

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,519
in a state of vacuum or water and soil

70
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,039
because it likes to stick to itself and

71
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,500
stick to the soil so it's sort of always

72
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:55,620
pulling on itself and pulling on the

73
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,019
soil and it makes this vacuum the more

74
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,759
water there is the weaker the vacuum

75
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,560
because there's more of it the less

76
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,179
water there is the stronger the vacuum

77
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,860
because there's less of it and it sort

78
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,200
of gets like really tightly stuck and

79
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,580
it's like really pulling on itself so

80
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,780
this is measuring it's called water

81
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,480
potential

82
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,219
so as opposed to measuring volumetric

83
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,919
water content which is the amount of

84
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:20,158
water in the pore spaces it is measuring

85
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,079
the availability of water to the plant a

86
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,939
way that I've often seen these described

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,980
in the University setting is it's a

88
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,900
dummy root it's essentially what this

89
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,139
experience is is what a root experience

90
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,900
is and whatever that vacuum is let's say

91
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:36,059
50 millibars the plant has to exert an

92
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,939
equal amount of force to get the water

93
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,519
so if that vacuum is stronger then the

94
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:44,519
plant can pull on it can't get any water

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,200
even if there's water and that's why the

96
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,080
amount of water isn't really as

97
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,699
important as how much work the plant has

98
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,200
to do to get it that's what a

99
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,899
tensiometer is measuring

100
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,479
there there you go

101
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,939
there's these kind of

102
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:02,419
these are wonderkin

103
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,419
you too famous

104
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:07,199
but the other I mean it's the other part

105
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,879
is we talk about tensiometers and we've

106
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,438
been talking about how to get them to

107
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,039
control irrigation

108
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,539
and of course that leads us to Blue

109
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,298
maths so we did a whole chunk of the

110
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,798
presentation on blue mats and I and I

111
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,138
feel like

112
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,120
I feel like it's important and could be

113
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,840
really useful to people that might be

114
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,180
seeing this to talk about the aspects of

115
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,819
blue mat irrigation that we did today

116
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,978
because part of what we

117
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,079
we called it we called we were we were

118
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:39,240
like this is Advanced blue mat

119
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,800
education or like the blue map master

120
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,478
class because

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,400
I mean

122
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,199
you know over at sustainable Village

123
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,839
we've got this office we've got like r d

124
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,900
spaces there we all have like home

125
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:54,000
facilities where we do work and and test

126
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:57,418
for things and experiment and play

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,100
around and over the last year like

128
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:00,659
Cooper came to work what didn't you have

129
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,600
when were you here it's about a year ago

130
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,600
just about right first week of February

131
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,460
last 2022 yeah so you came to work with

132
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
February too but been in the industry

133
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,079
for a little bit

134
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,540
you and you've been using Bluetooth for

135
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:18,478
that yeah it's like this is usually so

136
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,340
yeah Michael Turner Michael turned me on

137
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,639
pitched me

138
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:25,198
back in yeah 2018 or something like that

139
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,600
maybe a little before something like

140
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,639
that and that's you know like all the

141
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,840
other people kind of like the light bulb

142
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,660
goes off and you're like well that

143
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:36,359
sounds amazing a moisture sensing valve

144
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,720
and the plants water themselves I'm in

145
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,220
yeah and then you know then you then you

146
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,560
get some and you play with them and you

147
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,240
start to start the process of trying to

148
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,319
figure them out and then yeah been here

149
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,060
for

150
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,639
a year and I think we've made some

151
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,339
really big strides and

152
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,918
the understanding of the the product how

153
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,560
to use it and how to get really really

154
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,000
good results yeah yeah one thing I'm

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,038
trying to say about blue Mexico it's a

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,418
very common experience I also was using

157
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:04,860
them that's a lot longer than I worked

158
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:05,758
here A friend of mine showed me them in

159
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,560
college

160
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,300
I was running around watering a bunch of

161
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,819
different plants in different locations

162
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,379
and wow all my friends and partners are

163
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,139
always mad at me and he was like this

164
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:17,339
will save your life and and I didn't use

165
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,500
them for years after buying them

166
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:22,258
eventually I did and it did do exactly

167
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,240
what he described but I think the thing

168
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,580
that most people who use blue nets is

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,560
they get them and

170
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:31,019
they love them but there's there's a

171
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,519
learning curve there's like a process of

172
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:34,198
sort of like it's like an art and a

173
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,240
science you sort of have to learn how to

174
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,560
feel them how to fiddle with them and

175
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,139
one thing that we've really been trying

176
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,259
to approach is how do we make this

177
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,600
accessible to everybody and anybody with

178
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,819
little to no learning curve

179
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,979
and no need to run through trials and

180
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,660
errors to actually have a lot of success

181
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:54,120
so to do that we've really been working

182
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,919
at r d developing Sops and doing things

183
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,139
to make the process easier for everybody

184
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,779
and accessible to anyone who wants to

185
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:03,478
use them yeah yeah I think the process

186
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:06,119
really started for me by taking one

187
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,399
apart and seeing how simple

188
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,220
it really is

189
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,500
and and just kind of applying how you

190
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,259
want to show the parts yeah so it's just

191
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,120
a ceramic tip on a tube just like this

192
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:22,439
tensiometer here

193
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,720
and then the cap has a diaphragm that

194
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:28,019
this vacuum created here is able to act

195
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,800
on and then the rest of this cap

196
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:34,318
is adjustable and you can set a moisture

197
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,960
level how far how much vacuum needs to

198
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,259
be pulled before it will turn on

199
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,779
and so yeah once I've sort of

200
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,280
got to look at how simple it was it it

201
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,679
really kind of

202
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:49,019
yeah started the journey to to kind of

203
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,519
realize getting to the bottom of all

204
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,659
this stuff you're like well if this

205
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,879
thing there's only so much that can

206
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,400
happen here there's a it's not very

207
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:59,098
complicated so it's all the other things

208
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,198
and how they how you I know and it's

209
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,300
using Applause and it's funny yeah and

210
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,939
it's funny too like how we kind of came

211
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,579
to this or and it really it was like you

212
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,680
in particular that really cracked a code

213
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:13,079
on this one and then with a lot of

214
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,319
support from this one as well but like

215
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,598
this summer this guy eckerhart came to

216
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,660
this house and he's the they're like the

217
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,339
owners of blue mat Austria because we

218
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,960
don't make these things we import these

219
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,119
from Austria but

220
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,978
he came and he kind of gave us

221
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,899
they do things different way differently

222
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:33,120
it's all geared towards really really

223
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:36,000
simple applications household Gardens

224
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,759
and things like that the shit we do with

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,038
them is just so much different but

226
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,899
um he gave us a couple of little

227
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,879
interesting he made a few interesting

228
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,820
comments about how some people dial in

229
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:51,539
carrots and it really got yeah interest

230
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,459
he talked about people in in Germany and

231
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:56,219
hotels dialing thousands of carrots

232
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:58,859
presetting them and sticking the fancy

233
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,200
house plans for a landscaping

234
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,180
applications our our Jaws dropped and we

235
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,899
were like wait pre-setting a carrot

236
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:09,958
that's the dream yeah and uh to not have

237
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,278
to be you know fussing and hitting you

238
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,219
know hit that desired moisture level

239
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,139
first time and and the key to that turns

240
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,720
out to be you know keeping

241
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:21,240
this diaphragm at setting this diaphragm

242
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,220
at rest yeah one of the things that I

243
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,839
think is is really funny to watch Cooper

244
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,700
work on these types of things is he

245
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,760
always grabs it with his hands and he's

246
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,680
sort of like rubbing it and moving it

247
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,179
and like the real thing was they were

248
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,639
like okay we're setting these carrots in

249
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:37,199
a glass of water and that's when the

250
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,419
light bulbs switched like oh you're

251
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,640
setting it at zero action on the

252
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,899
diaphragm and then Cooper was just sort

253
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,458
of like holding it in his hand and I

254
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,440
could see him like grabbing it and like

255
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,139
moving his hands all over it and then he

256
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,519
just said it without the bottom on it

257
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,639
and then he was like wait a moment

258
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:56,879
there's not you can't have less action

259
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:59,278
than no action you know and

260
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,100
you know by action we mean like on this

261
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,778
rubber part can I see that yeah on this

262
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,000
this thing this I mean I don't know if

263
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:08,879
you can see it here but this pushes in

264
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,220
and it's basically as the soil is drying

265
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,679
out it's it's creating a vacuum on that

266
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,040
and it's sucking this valve down sucking

267
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,079
this little pinch Point down and that's

268
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,439
tension that's pressure

269
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,959
and if we set the thing

270
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,180
without any of that pressure we can get

271
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,458
consistency from care to care to carrot

272
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,859
that's precise and exact because it's

273
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,179
all set to atmospheric pressure so I

274
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,980
think it's important we just jump right

275
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,719
in and like show this technique right

276
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,940
kind of the beginning of this

277
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,379
this talk here because

278
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,060
this is what we want people to know

279
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,120
about we want people to know how to do

280
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:48,799
this because every time someone has

281
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,620
flooded a bed or flooded a pot like

282
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,019
there's only a hamster there's about

283
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,360
five things that could have gone wrong

284
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:59,459
and what we've done over the last year

285
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,759
has been like what are those five things

286
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:04,559
here are

287
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,480
precise troubleshooting tips for all

288
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,739
those different things and it's it's

289
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,480
basically

290
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,399
I think we're really close to just being

291
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,778
completely covered on all that yeah I

292
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,879
think what I think I think at this point

293
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:16,200
we basically have I mean we're gonna

294
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,799
like release the thing on the website

295
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,379
about like the six ways or of avoiding

296
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:26,278
flooding stuff like that how to not fuck

297
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:28,320
up yeah the thing is it's uh I'm very

298
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:30,838
guilty of it too it's really

299
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,360
I got a terrible Baker because I hate

300
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,660
perfectly following every instruction if

301
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,600
it feels arbitrary yeah uh austrians are

302
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:41,100
not arbitrary people

303
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,019
everything that is in the instructions

304
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,540
is there for a reason there are many

305
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:48,179
reasons I thought they weren't and there

306
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,799
has never been one part of the

307
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,719
instructions that we didn't find was

308
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,799
actually very important once figuring

309
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,720
out why

310
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,458
so let's just do it like how do we dial

311
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,940
in Carousel like what is the best

312
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:03,599
practice for dialing in a carrot

313
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:07,500
there I mean the way we would do it now

314
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,060
um is just to gather all your tops

315
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,799
right so you're taking the bottoms off

316
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:12,239
the bottoms go into a bucket of water

317
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,539
and they're just sitting they're sitting

318
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,240
there okay and then we're gonna in your

319
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:21,659
system tee off

320
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,879
and attach and pressurize the system and

321
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,679
start to attach these and yeah we're

322
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,299
kind of talking about you know basically

323
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,458
you can set up a little rig right like

324
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,919
you if you take the pressure reducer

325
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,659
that you're actually going to be using

326
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:34,860
for your room so like because they

327
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:37,500
there's some variation with those

328
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,980
pressure reducers FYI they're not all

329
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:45,000
like exactly 15 mil 15 psi we're seeing

330
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,800
we don't let them know 16 yes a little

331
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,179
bit anyways just use the same pressure I

332
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,578
reduced so that you're going to be using

333
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,799
in that particular room you set it up

334
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:54,659
run some like eight mil tubing off of it

335
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,539
put a eight millimeter by three

336
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:59,100
millimeter t on that and a valve at each

337
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:03,360
end right so you just have this little

338
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:05,159
chunk of of uh yeah I usually pick um

339
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,500
you know testing I usually pick you to

340
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,759
the first pot or the first bed so what

341
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,259
I'll do is like if you've already run

342
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,519
out all your tubing you pick the very

343
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:13,259
first spot there's gonna be a t there

344
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,519
you just disconnect the tubing and add a

345
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,078
little piece of tubing with a valve

346
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,459
right after it yeah so we're describing

347
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,379
two different things like one you could

348
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:21,899
either you could either build out all

349
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,159
your supply line and then just run it

350
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:25,019
off that which actually probably the

351
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,059
best way

352
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:29,159
and then or if you just want to do it

353
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:31,619
like standing you know like next to the

354
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,659
the hose spit bib or wherever your water

355
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,278
comes in you could just you could build

356
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:38,219
a little rig yourself with the pressure

357
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:41,159
reducer and a short piece of of uh

358
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,040
tubing but but this is basically the

359
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,299
answer yeah just do it like do it

360
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:49,399
somewhere it's somewhere it's

361
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,399
comfortable to sit for a little while

362
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,519
six and one half dozen of the other

363
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,159
depending on your system size

364
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,440
uh you know it may be easier to do it

365
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,139
one way or the other but the important

366
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,200
part is to be on the pressure of your

367
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:06,539
system yeah and one at a time and yeah

368
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,180
and then one at a time take these caps

369
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:11,699
find the hanging drip

370
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:14,519
and then close it

371
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,480
one or two triangles depending go

372
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,679
through that a little bit more like what

373
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,379
do you mean you find the hanging drill

374
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:22,259
so the hanging drip is the point where

375
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:23,939
water flows you open this up water's

376
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,439
gushing out just shooting out in the

377
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,360
Stream yep we've just got water coming

378
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,220
out and you'll close it and it will

379
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,079
start to slow that stream

380
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,660
until eventually you'll find the point

381
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,278
where it stops and you can catch a

382
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:37,078
little droplet on the end and you know

383
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,578
that a little bit more open that droplet

384
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,979
grows and falls off a little bit more

385
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,958
close and you've you've found that point

386
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,940
where this exact point that was

387
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,039
literally a drip comes out of the edge

388
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,740
of the tube and hangs there

389
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,139
and does not you can just yep it's a

390
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,839
hanging drip and that's going to be you

391
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:57,360
know a very precise Point funny story

392
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,120
if you ever try to like we've done these

393
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,940
things in in Spanish language trying to

394
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,060
get the right translation for hanging

395
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:09,300
drip uh-huh is tricky so anybody out

396
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:11,518
there that's you know fluent in Spanish

397
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:13,679
that has a really good description of

398
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,039
hanging drip I'd love to hear what it is

399
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,859
it is

400
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:21,480
anyways sorry so yeah so once you've

401
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,560
found that point

402
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,180
um you then make your adjustment

403
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,799
closed from there one or two triangles

404
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,719
depending on your system's back end

405
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,000
pressure which we now have a graph

406
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,699
that'll give you a Target

407
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,519
so you'll know starting off whether you

408
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:40,620
want to let's shoot for one or two yeah

409
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,078
let's pick one let's say we're at 15 psi

410
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,240
at 15 psi you're gonna go two triangles

411
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:46,679
close and where will that take you and

412
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,899
that's gonna take you to a hundred M Bar

413
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,819
where does one take you One's Gonna Take

414
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:54,179
You to 50 m bar and where does zero take

415
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:57,060
you zero is zero is zero hitting drip is

416
00:15:54,179 --> 00:16:00,299
going to be full runoff that more than

417
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:03,958
likely at 15 psi you're gonna have water

418
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:06,240
coming out of that so at 15 psi with if

419
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,919
we dial that back two triangles like

420
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,320
which is in a lot of the instructions up

421
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,899
to this point yep you dial that back two

422
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,820
triangles and 15 psi that is going to

423
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,679
put a really in basic in like high

424
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,820
porosity soils that's going to put you

425
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,239
right at

426
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,579
100 millibars and again and if if the

427
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,959
back end pressure is 2 PSI like on a

428
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:28,379
gravity system that's going to put you

429
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:31,500
at about a 150 50. yes and then there's

430
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:34,679
a line between those two points right 15

431
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,440
psi 100 millibars

432
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:39,899
2 PSI 150 millibars there's a direct

433
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,720
line and that is that's that that's how

434
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:46,078
that line graph is accurate so anywhere

435
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,139
between that if we're looking at 7 PSI

436
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:52,739
we're going to be at like what would we

437
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,720
say like 100 yeah 125. so that's the

438
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,759
difference right in the middle there so

439
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,339
there's this direct correlation between

440
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,199
the back end pressure and the moisture

441
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,899
level of the soil

442
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,058
so yeah once you've chosen once you know

443
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,160
where you want to go on that then you

444
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:10,740
can take this the water will be shut off

445
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,259
at that point through kit you can lock

446
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,000
it and now this will always be set in

447
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:16,439
your system to that level and what would

448
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,699
you recommend them doing it before they

449
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,679
actually lock it because this is

450
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:21,839
something I do and I recommend yeah you

451
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,179
know it's a really helpful tool to take

452
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:29,178
a sharpie and Mark on the top of the cap

453
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:29,179
against this there's like a fin here

454
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:38,159
and if you mark with the Sharpie where

455
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:40,259
that setting is now you'll know if you

456
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,538
know you you turn around and turn back

457
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,900
you know that you said it and that it's

458
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:47,700
right at the same in case you bump it

459
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,320
and then you can lock it and that'll

460
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,600
just show you later when you take this

461
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,399
cap off you'll know whether you

462
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,500
accidentally just bumped it or moved it

463
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,059
afterwards so you can still find that

464
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,980
same point this is this is the Locking

465
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:00,298
cap so that's just like yeah these are

466
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,519
on the website whatever they they're

467
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:03,660
like these little plastic caps you know

468
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,058
I guess we got a few of them sitting

469
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,380
here but you know they snap they've been

470
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:08,940
around for a while but we just people

471
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,780
don't use them as much they just snap on

472
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,000
that

473
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:14,038
and locks it so that means that like

474
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,200
when you're you know

475
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,419
you can't bump it you're like

476
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,058
whatever like a squirrel comes into your

477
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,360
Greenhouse or your yeah or your or your

478
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,859
chop and dropping coverage

479
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,199
employee walks up and tries to mess with

480
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:30,959
it like they're not going to be able to

481
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,538
because it's all set and dialed and now

482
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,519
that cap that now that it's locked

483
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:36,240
set

484
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,480
um

485
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,480
this thing you can just it's it's there

486
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,819
that's at 15 psi that's 100 millibars

487
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,980
every time every time you could put you

488
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:49,079
can put one you could put a nine inch

489
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,480
base on it you could put a five inch

490
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,859
base on it whatever you want and it's

491
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
still going to produce that same

492
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:56,219
moisture level

493
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,339
um you know where the tip is where this

494
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,960
tip is and so

495
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:03,298
um you know like between rounds you can

496
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,860
take this off you set these off to the

497
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:06,960
side you put your Bottoms in a bucket of

498
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:09,298
water and store them but that's it so

499
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,819
you can you can dial six of these like

500
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:15,240
that you can dial 60 you can dial 600

501
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:17,220
you can dial 6 000. like this

502
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,620
the idea of doing like a thousand

503
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,660
carrots in a thousand pots previously

504
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:22,979
it's not like we haven't done it but

505
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,740
it's kind of it was kind of like okay

506
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,259
there's definitely gonna be some funny

507
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,640
things going on now I don't I don't have

508
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:31,679
any problem with that no I have no

509
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,460
because it's the same thing from pot to

510
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,200
pot to pot complete consistency yeah as

511
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,340
long as like it's crazy that we've like

512
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,640
hit this and then come through this

513
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:43,079
journey

514
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,320
yeah and then the other things to keep

515
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:48,178
consistency is once this is set and you

516
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,399
know that the setting on the blue mats

517
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,259
is exactly the same there's only a

518
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,559
couple other factors that can now affect

519
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:57,179
the blue mat and where that setting lies

520
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,220
um and I guess

521
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:01,140
one last little thing I want to put in

522
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,558
there what I often like doing is

523
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,660
actually marking the hanging drip and

524
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,399
two triangles with a little marker

525
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,720
because you never want to open it past

526
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,059
the hanging drip ever or you're

527
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,940
guaranteed to flood because it's now

528
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:16,859
open which is a concept that I think is

529
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,840
I had to explain a lot of times to

530
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:21,058
people it's like if you only ever closed

531
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,798
it two triangles back past hanging drip

532
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:24,779
and then you opened it two triangles

533
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,700
trying to get it wetter you are now open

534
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:29,220
it's no longer closed it's like you

535
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,500
opened a ball valve it will never turn

536
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,120
off and so like you'll never go drier

537
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,980
than two triangles and you'll never go

538
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,899
wetter than the hanging drip so I often

539
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,038
like to draw those two lines because you

540
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,620
always know you're going to be between

541
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:43,259
those two points

542
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:46,619
yeah and from there then the only thing

543
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:49,679
that's affecting yeah let's do it step

544
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,879
by step so after this this is set you've

545
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,679
now got all these here you've got all

546
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,419
these in a bucket you just put them

547
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,460
together under water the one thing I

548
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,440
like to do is just take my thumb and rub

549
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,120
this little area massage those three

550
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,380
holes just get any little air bubbles

551
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:03,298
out it doesn't really matter if there's

552
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,440
like a like tiny little air bubbles in

553
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:06,599
there but just don't worry about the

554
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,419
obviously you know like don't do that

555
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,459
just use your thumb to just push to push

556
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:13,140
it out we found over time that while it

557
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,600
does have an effect it's a small enough

558
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,160
one that it's not it's not important

559
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,359
yeah yeah

560
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,360
um yeah and then you just put these

561
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:23,219
together under water and then

562
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,139
now you've got a bucket with these all

563
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,538
put together you can take them back over

564
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,400
to your system which hopefully has you

565
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:31,440
know all the tubing laid out

566
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,679
um or do that and then you just connect

567
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,600
them in place and they're already set

568
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:39,298
exactly yeah yeah you just want to make

569
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:42,119
sure that that soil as well as you know

570
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,619
evenly watered and not hydrophobic right

571
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:45,119
yeah right that's the next jump into

572
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:47,099
that here's a couple other like little

573
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,798
troubleshooting things of like

574
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:51,418
how do I screw up well here's some of

575
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:54,619
the ways you might screw up yeah dry

576
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,620
pockets and peeps

577
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,460
hydrophobic peat the amount of times

578
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,960
that people have reached out and they're

579
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,400
like my blue mat's acting weird it just

580
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,038
like won't turn off or like won't turn

581
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,360
on and the whole bed's dry I always just

582
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,400
tell them to start like checking their

583
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:12,359
moisture meter around those areas or

584
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,220
even just feeling it and it's very

585
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,359
common for it to just be wildly

586
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,579
different moisture readings all

587
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,319
throughout the bed or you can just feel

588
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:22,379
that there's these dry pockets that's

589
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:24,178
because when he gets high uh Hydro when

590
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,980
it gets really dry it gets hydrophobic

591
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,360
it's very hard to re-wet it I'm sure

592
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,400
everyone's had it where their soil is

593
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,678
really dry they're watering it it looks

594
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,659
wet but you lift up like a centimeter of

595
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,159
it and it's still as dry as can be

596
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:36,360
underneath and it's literally coming at

597
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,580
the bottom of the pot nothing's

598
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,259
re-wetting and with soil beds that's

599
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:42,000
really tough because you can't see it

600
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,859
you can't like visually look in the bed

601
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,798
and make sure

602
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:49,859
that it's all wet so just using

603
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,960
surfactants mixing it up beforehand just

604
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:53,459
never letting it go dry ideally with

605
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,100
something like a blue net just anything

606
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,779
like that will really help out you needs

607
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:59,819
to be consistent yeah or when you're

608
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:02,038
filling your bed

609
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:03,839
not filling it to the top before you

610
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:06,298
start to moisten that soil can be

611
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,038
helpful as well just to be you know

612
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:09,418
putting in a six inch layer and getting

613
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,158
that wet and then putting in another six

614
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:14,038
inch layer and getting that way because

615
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,900
getting an 18 inch bed it's it's

616
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:17,099
consistently wet from that it just

617
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,240
doesn't work I don't want to try to do

618
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,439
with it with your blue Mount system you

619
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,960
know what I see a lot of people do is

620
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,000
like put like a bunch of dry peat-based

621
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,200
soil in a pot and they set up their blue

622
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,940
mats and they're just like when I crank

623
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,519
them open and try to get the blue soap

624
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,419
to you know put enough water down on the

625
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:35,639
bed to hydrate it that will take weeks

626
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:37,259
and it can harm your blue so yeah I mean

627
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,640
just don't do it don't that's not the

628
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:40,619
way to do it you want to use like a

629
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,299
regular garden hose or something and

630
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,699
like Cooper's saying you layer it in

631
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:45,658
like anybody that's rehydrated soil in

632
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,340
pots

633
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,780
you know has probably learned this

634
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:51,000
through trial and error but like in case

635
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:53,700
you have it you know like learn from our

636
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,380
mistakes is you go through like put six

637
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,460
inches of soil down take your garden

638
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,919
hose

639
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,558
hit it hard like with water get a lot of

640
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:04,440
water in there another six inches in

641
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,319
so on and so forth yeah mixing it and

642
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,200
making sure

643
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:12,298
at the same time

644
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,940
in the ass than chasing it correct yeah

645
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:17,099
for the next month or two or what you

646
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,659
know just because it's in a big bed like

647
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:20,939
in like a four foot wide like you know

648
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:23,940
like a four by even like a four by eight

649
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,860
or like a four by Twenty bed so 200 or

650
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,840
100 yeah yeah his bed's going out like

651
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:29,579
there's there can be like there can be

652
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,918
dry Pockets that exist there for months

653
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:34,079
I might describe it as the number one

654
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,220
problem that most people can face with

655
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,960
living soil because you know I've been

656
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,058
doing living soil for a long time and I

657
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,400
always would run into these weird random

658
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:42,960
issues in the past when I was doing hand

659
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,759
watering where everything would be

660
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,779
amazing and all of a sudden stuff's

661
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,640
really weird and I don't know what's

662
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:49,500
happening and I started to realize over

663
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,780
time if I just like left that bed for

664
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,880
too long and it got super dry and then I

665
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:57,720
came back in and watered it

666
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,919
I can never get it right again

667
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
um so I think being able to keep

668
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,400
consistent moisture in living small beds

669
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,019
might mitigate what at least for me has

670
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,200
been the most common problem and people

671
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,759
are afraid of like compaction and they I

672
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,220
think I think a lot of people think that

673
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,379
like loose fluffiness when they first

674
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,960
feel a bed is like good and they want

675
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,740
that level of aeration and I just don't

676
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,600
think

677
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,599
anything wants that level available

678
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:26,519
it's really hard to compact that kind of

679
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,620
soil as long as it's moist like over

680
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,019
compact yeah at least in a short time

681
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:33,000
maybe if you're like dumping crazy

682
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,639
amounts of water from like five feet up

683
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,159
you know or like months or when it

684
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,538
becomes hydrophobic yeah brick telling

685
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,559
you can't get the water to penetrate

686
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,720
inside of it because it's actually

687
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,759
repelling water and perlite makes that

688
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,400
not happen also if there's probiotics

689
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:49,798
people shouldn't be afraid of you know

690
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,659
you don't want to leech any of your

691
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,819
you know amendments out or whatever or

692
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:56,460
any of your nutrition away but what but

693
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:59,519
I think anything short of that is good

694
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,960
to um to that first time get that media

695
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,538
is

696
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,159
you know as wet and compact as you kind

697
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:06,720
of can is going to help make that system

698
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,600
operate properly

699
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,140
and consistently for for much longer and

700
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,579
a lot yeah yeah easier faster and I

701
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,600
think that then kind of takes us to the

702
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:17,519
next thing which is really important

703
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,740
which is a Tight Seal around the blue

704
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,558
mat the blue mat is a physical tool

705
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,900
which means it's not sensor it's not

706
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,298
like an electronic sensor it the water

707
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,340
has to get to the cone physically analog

708
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:32,339
yeah totally analog and so what that

709
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:34,379
means is it it there's not tight soil

710
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:36,599
around the sensor it's not like really

711
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,360
up against it the water's not going to

712
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,459
Wick and the thing is the less of what

713
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,859
the less media that's up against that

714
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,960
the slower it's going to react the water

715
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:47,939
will still Wick and find equilibrium it

716
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,100
always does but it's no longer going to

717
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,679
happen at these favorable speeds where

718
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:54,359
the system's really reactive so it's not

719
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,500
like having a single piece of perlite

720
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:57,178
like I think some people think having

721
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,440
like just a piece of pumice against your

722
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:01,019
densityometer is going to make the thing

723
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,820
flood it's not they are more reliable

724
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,679
than that but what it will do is make

725
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:06,418
that sensor less accurate than the rest

726
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,179
of them what I've always done is just

727
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,620
taken some of my soil necks and just

728
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,179
removed any big you know if you've got

729
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:14,278
big pumice anything like that I'll just

730
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,778
like yeah just take like a couple gallon

731
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,119
pot fill it up with soil mix pick

732
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:20,880
anything big little tiny chunks don't

733
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,500
really matter pure cocoa or peat yeah I

734
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,140
don't I like doing the same soil mix

735
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,359
just so it Remains the Same the one

736
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,759
thing with Pete is if that pocket of

737
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,319
peat goes hydrophobic now you really

738
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:32,460
yeah I mean that's unlikely because

739
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:34,500
you're putting such a you know like I

740
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,419
always take it take it and you like jam

741
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,679
it in there and make a hole yeah with

742
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:39,360
the thing and then you take like a

743
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,700
handful of that loose like pure Coke

744
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,678
repeat you throw it in there and then

745
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,960
you stick the carrot in and that creates

746
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,019
this like very thin like sheath

747
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,778
definitely of of yeah of that pure mix

748
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:53,879
around it so you just have that nice

749
00:27:50,778 --> 00:27:57,599
solid like consistent

750
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,520
mounting of the carrot tip into the

751
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,319
media the media the one thing I just

752
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,940
want to like say though is it's like I

753
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:05,879
wouldn't be afraid of like if you've got

754
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,440
Pro mix I've run my care and 50 perlite

755
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,059
mixes and it's totally fine it's not

756
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,880
little bits that matter it's those

757
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:14,158
really big coarse chunks I've never

758
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,679
personally run into that problem I

759
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,360
haven't either but I don't know it's a

760
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,340
real thing though yeah yeah and but what

761
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:23,639
I've always done to kind of Ensure like

762
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:26,038
this thing's seated well is why don't be

763
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,320
afraid to water around it once to get

764
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,839
like that smaller particle yeah or just

765
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,519
be firm and like yeah or like just as a

766
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:34,558
side note like on on big on products

767
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,700
like this like these come in like 48

768
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:37,259
inch ones right they're really deep

769
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,880
these neurometers and they're using like

770
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:40,259
Orchards and things where they want to

771
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,200
know like what is the moisture level

772
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:45,119
four feet down in the soil and these are

773
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,919
soils that are like clay and rock and

774
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,298
like all kinds of who knows what's down

775
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,480
in there it's just like you're burrowing

776
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:54,538
into the Earth so they use an auger

777
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,220
drill and they drill down four feet with

778
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:59,158
like a you know like an odd big like big

779
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,278
ass drill bit on like on a hand drill

780
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,200
pull out a column and then they take

781
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:05,880
that and they make a slurry they take

782
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,798
that stuff and they mix it in a bucket

783
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,299
of water make mud out of it yeah make a

784
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:11,759
mud out of it and then you pour that

785
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:13,859
slurry back down into the hole and then

786
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,538
you jam this thing down in there so it's

787
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:17,459
completely coated in that mud and

788
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:19,440
that'll dry out over time but it'll yeah

789
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,000
it's like setting it in cement yeah it's

790
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,320
gonna it's gonna make us like a really

791
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,419
firm connection to that to that tip it's

792
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,460
all about the tip

793
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:31,860
one thing that I've seen also that's

794
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,840
really interesting about the uh the blue

795
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:37,259
the low tension version of the erometer

796
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:39,418
tips and also uh Blue Mountain cylinder

797
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:41,700
tips is the more porous the ceramic the

798
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:44,038
more reactive it is and these are tuned

799
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,019
for load tension soils meaning that they

800
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:49,220
can move water in and out really quickly

801
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:51,720
they are very sensitive instruments yeah

802
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,798
but yeah so now we've gone through step

803
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,019
by step you know first thing you're

804
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,639
setting your your care on the Caps no

805
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:57,898
action on the diaphragm that's in it

806
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,299
they're all set the same because they're

807
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:01,619
at the same set point next putting them

808
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,480
in your carrots putting them in making

809
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:05,219
sure there's a really good seal the next

810
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,899
thing that's really important this is

811
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,100
the other way to affect the setting of a

812
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:12,778
blue net is where the water comes out

813
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:15,658
and this sort of

814
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:17,640
leads into any system where you're

815
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:20,399
relying on sensors to automate which

816
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,899
really is the future of most systems it

817
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:26,579
seems at this point is you need

818
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:29,278
consistency so if you have a carrot with

819
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:30,839
the tubing this far out that water is

820
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,819
going to get down to here

821
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:36,240
really quickly it's going to shut it off

822
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:38,579
really fast if you have the water coming

823
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,899
out over here now it has to spread out

824
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:42,058
from this far away point it's going to

825
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:44,158
shut off much slower the way that I like

826
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:45,720
to describe it is that the setting on

827
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,159
the balloon that decides when the thing

828
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:52,380
turns on and off technically but the

829
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:54,659
water where it's coming out decides how

830
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,179
quickly it turns off so it might turn

831
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:58,740
off when the tip here is always going to

832
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,298
turn off let's say that 100 millibars

833
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,519
but if the water is coming out way over

834
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:04,679
here this area of your pot or bed might

835
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:06,119
be really wet by the time it actually

836
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,179
gets the blue map

837
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:11,038
so to be really cognizant of setting all

838
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:13,159
your blue mats with the water coming out

839
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,720
at the same point

840
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:16,820
and with water distribution being very

841
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,659
even

842
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:21,178
manifolds around my we've been doing

843
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:23,659
that if you want to talk about that

844
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:27,000
yeah yeah I mean the manifolds are like

845
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:29,220
so like you know water comes through one

846
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,619
of these things it's your caps dialed

847
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,960
they're buried soil dries out dries out

848
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:35,759
the tip creates a vacuum opens the valve

849
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,679
and then water is going to flow through

850
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,019
you know through this tube and start

851
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,360
dripping out or it's going to go into a

852
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:43,859
series of distribution drippers or it's

853
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:47,278
going to go into some sort of water

854
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:48,898
distribution array and more often than

855
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,119
not in large container applications

856
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:53,519
we're doing that with some sort of

857
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,139
soaker hose right well one kind of sub

858
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,599
rolls in particular which we call Blue

859
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,899
soak which is basically it's like a

860
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:03,058
Tyvek soaker hose that operates at it

861
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:05,959
gives it's really cool because you know

862
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:09,960
we the reason we use that is because

863
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:12,360
it's a product that gives uniform water

864
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,819
distribution over long distances at

865
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:18,599
extremely low pressure I mean we're

866
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:20,639
talking like like sub one PSI we can get

867
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,259
that and any other kind of like drip

868
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,640
tape or whatever and we've been through

869
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:25,679
this and it's like we just like haven't

870
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,240
dialed it in we haven't found it like

871
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,820
anything with drip emitters in it it's

872
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,460
like we're looking at like you need like

873
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:34,918
seven to ten PSI to hit

874
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,259
uniform distribution

875
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,460
um throughout that tubing and it's you

876
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:40,200
know that's that's the reason we're

877
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,640
using that's that's why we've gone with

878
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,740
this blue silk material it had it

879
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,940
manufactured and done this thing is

880
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,079
because we can get that uniform

881
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,278
distribution at really really low

882
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,918
pressures which is which are the

883
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:51,960
pressure ranges that we're operating on

884
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,778
um it's a really special product in its

885
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,519
own way it's just as cool as blue mats

886
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:57,839
are because you can really gravity

887
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:00,720
irrigate

888
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,699
huge areas of land actually how I first

889
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,259
found sustainable Village not just the

890
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,399
blue mats ironically I didn't know I was

891
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:07,919
buying them from sustainable Village

892
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:10,439
because when I first bought them I just

893
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,940
thought it was blue mats but is using

894
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,798
blue silk over like these really long

895
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,740
distances and I was trying to irrigate

896
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:18,778
for like permaculture reasons and yeah

897
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,058
just really actually super cool product

898
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:22,859
on the side yeah that is there's um

899
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:25,619
there is some ways to apply that to like

900
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:27,000
large acreage applications like one

901
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:29,219
thing we do is

902
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,720
like we do these really cool large-scale

903
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,759
permaculture installations there's a lot

904
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,620
of like super wealthy people around

905
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:36,538
Boulder County where we live that want

906
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:38,339
to have these like beautiful Hobby Farms

907
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:39,538
and things like that that

908
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:40,918
and we were there's some great

909
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:43,558
permaculture designers in the area and

910
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,659
we work in hand in hand with them to

911
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:47,038
uh to do the irrigation portions of

912
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:49,799
those and

913
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:52,859
um that's that's like a fun lucky

914
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:54,359
for me part of this job and this role we

915
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:57,599
have but definitely that's side point

916
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,740
that's yeah we do on the side and uh so

917
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,119
I guess back there this is the final

918
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,339
point of it is when you're doing water

919
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:04,379
distribution make sure it's all the same

920
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:06,778
if you have manifolds or laying out in

921
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,878
your beds make sure they're all laid out

922
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:10,980
the exact same way and then when you pay

923
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,858
place your blue mats place your blue

924
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,440
mats all in exactly the same place in

925
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:18,480
relation to to it we've sort of landed

926
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,280
on three to four inches away from the

927
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,460
soaker tape the short one we like three

928
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,480
the longer one you can do more like four

929
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,159
instructions generally say three because

930
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,199
it's the one number that works for both

931
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,000
very well and you can play around with

932
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,559
it a little bit but be careful because

933
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,539
if you move it too far away from the

934
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:36,358
tape no matter what the blue mat is set

935
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:39,000
to you can still over water the bed and

936
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:42,179
I think that understanding

937
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,099
the water release and the sensor as a

938
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,500
pair really helps you understand like

939
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:47,940
how they actually work

940
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,739
yeah

941
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,440
yeah and then I guess now we're getting

942
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:54,539
the pressure which is the final bit well

943
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,398
this is the fun part yeah I mean this is

944
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:57,659
this is this is where it gets really

945
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,420
kind of cool this is the real like

946
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:02,519
Master Class part of it is that so now

947
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,420
that we have this chart right we have

948
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:10,320
like a 15 psi it's and two hanging drips

949
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:12,180
here at 100 millibars and at 2 PSI uh at

950
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,859
uh two hanging drips you don't have 50

951
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:15,960
50. because now you have this like

952
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:17,098
continuous like it's not even a curve

953
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,820
it's basically a straight line it's a

954
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:25,800
line yeah and so what happens is

955
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,660
if we're able to adjust the pressure the

956
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,079
back end pressure on a preset carrot

957
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:34,078
that's already set in a bed in a pot

958
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,960
operating irrigating we can

959
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,220
very precisely

960
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,300
manipulate the moisture level of the

961
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,759
soil

962
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,980
not just in one pop but like uniformly

963
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,520
from for every container in the whole in

964
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,760
the whole room or Greenhouse or field we

965
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,320
can bring that moisture level down

966
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,099
consistently by adjusting the back end

967
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,859
pressure and like when we're up or up

968
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:02,160
yeah yeah essentially we are now in

969
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:04,380
total control of soil moisture and in

970
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,539
the past the way blue mats have always

971
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,700
sort of been set is you set them to one

972
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,619
point and you leave them there and which

973
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,759
is cool yeah which works really well you

974
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:13,140
can't decide and it's great like that's

975
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,420
like the whole thing like that's great

976
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:16,858
yeah it adapts the microcline was adapts

977
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,599
the rainy days and cloudy days and sunny

978
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:20,460
days and big plants and little plants

979
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:22,380
and that's sort of yeah the promise of

980
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,559
the system and why it's so special now

981
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,780
we can move them through plant stages

982
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:30,539
with different watering requirements and

983
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,040
that was just at a friend's house and

984
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:33,059
and I was explaining to him you know

985
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,460
with a

986
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:37,380
with pressure set he can he can go ahead

987
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,960
and Transplant into his veg containers

988
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:42,059
and run a certain pressure and be wetter

989
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,519
during veg and then move into his flower

990
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:46,739
room set at a different pressure never

991
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,480
having to touch the carrots and just by

992
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:50,759
moving from the one pressure Zone into

993
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,320
the other pressure Zone deliver a

994
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,880
different moisture level to those same

995
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,019
plants without ever having to touch the

996
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,820
sensor

997
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:59,460
and that's a key thing because I think

998
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:02,039
one of the biggest uh barriers to blue

999
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,599
mats at scale before this particularly

1000
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:06,059
in hydro and any type of thing just like

1001
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,800
you know many many carrots in small pots

1002
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,420
has been if you want to change the

1003
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,820
moisture content you have to change the

1004
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,440
dial on every single one of them which

1005
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,420
it's you know like 10 carats it takes

1006
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,280
you two or three minutes with you know

1007
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,539
50 it's a little bit more and so all of

1008
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,920
a sudden you get into thousands of

1009
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:22,259
carrots you might be spending a whole

1010
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,300
day changing them in every one you set

1011
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,420
is a part where an employee can set them

1012
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:30,420
off by a triangle or something so now

1013
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,858
you can affect the setting on all the

1014
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,659
blue mats that are tied to that pressure

1015
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:35,578
reducer in your system and with these

1016
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,980
really high flow rates we can tie many

1017
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:41,220
many blue mats to a single reducer from

1018
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:44,159
one point and you can SLP what that what

1019
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:45,779
that pressure is to then deliver those

1020
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,779
moisture levels that you that you want

1021
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:52,619
so you can say hey we're running those

1022
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:54,420
beds at 12 PSI and you'll be delivering

1023
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:56,519
a certain moisture level and you can say

1024
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,559
on these beds over here we're going to

1025
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:00,539
be at eight and that would be a drier

1026
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,940
setting across that whole zone so

1027
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:05,460
there's really cool opportunity for

1028
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,440
different applications and ways to use

1029
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,900
it and

1030
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,460
it's really exciting to be see you know

1031
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,559
it's I think we're going to pretty

1032
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,139
rapidly be implementing these systems

1033
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:19,019
and getting to see the results and yeah

1034
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:23,159
it's really it's a good time to be yeah

1035
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:24,599
I mean into blue mats absolutely

1036
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,980
you know one thing that I think is

1037
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,019
really interesting that has been making

1038
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,820
me think about this a lot is one of the

1039
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:32,940
biggest difficulties that multi-state

1040
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:36,059
operators face is getting the same

1041
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,139
product out of facilities that are in

1042
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:38,880
different states or even different

1043
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:40,618
locations you know you have one up in

1044
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,059
the like in Colorado you've got planes

1045
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,440
you've got mountains you've got deserts

1046
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:44,460
you could have two facilities that are

1047
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,320
only an hour apart and they're

1048
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,380
completely different climate zones and

1049
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,420
that does affect even an indoor facility

1050
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,400
and definitely a greenhouse and most

1051
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,320
definitely outdoor and so what that

1052
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,700
means is everywhere that you're growing

1053
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,980
is going to have these different

1054
00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:01,139
conditions and that makes it really hard

1055
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,599
to get the product consistent one thing

1056
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:05,578
that about setting tensiometers letting

1057
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,400
them control your pots is they make the

1058
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:10,560
moisture in the pot exactly the same pot

1059
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,358
to pot no matter what the HVAC

1060
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,880
conditions no matter what conditions

1061
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:16,519
you're under everything might change you

1062
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,680
might have like the greatest you know

1063
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:21,119
Windstorm or the sun is 120 degrees that

1064
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,759
day it's like the moisture content will

1065
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,220
not change in those pots and so allows

1066
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,700
you to create more consistent conditions

1067
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:32,578
between multiple facilities

1068
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:35,219
and yeah and sop and cultivars and their

1069
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,900
likes and dislikes and yeah through the

1070
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:39,179
opportunity to really

1071
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,820
really control soil moisture level I

1072
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:42,899
mean on a on a level down to you know

1073
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,300
within

1074
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,920
10 millibars of a Target across the room

1075
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,980
is just

1076
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,500
yeah it's it's very in the world of

1077
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,358
irrigation control it's not something

1078
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,159
that's managed to be done before no it's

1079
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:58,078
kind of crazy there's so I don't know if

1080
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,679
you guys I mean you guys know about this

1081
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,680
but like there's

1082
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,039
they're you know in the world of drip

1083
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,140
irrigation right there's like maybe five

1084
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,599
major manufacturers and they're all like

1085
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:12,539
really really similar you have like you

1086
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:16,619
have metaphm and rivulus and ear attack

1087
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:18,059
and Jane I think now Jane and I think is

1088
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,280
blockchain except for their India

1089
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:22,199
operations or whatever but like

1090
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,579
you know you got these you got a few big

1091
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:26,159
manufacturers then there's a ton of like

1092
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:28,079
Chinese companies that you know don't

1093
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,899
necessarily have names anybody would

1094
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,339
recognize but the um these main

1095
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,139
manufacturers they're all the same Parts

1096
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:35,400
all the same pieces

1097
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:36,960
but

1098
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,480
and they're great like drip irrigation

1099
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,699
is is as far from a water conservation

1100
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,280
point of view it's wonderful

1101
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:45,960
mostly there's energy issues that go

1102
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,339
alongside of that but from water

1103
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,019
conservation point of view it's really

1104
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:51,960
wonderful technology

1105
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:53,639
but there's still Limited in their

1106
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,699
ability to

1107
00:40:53,639 --> 00:41:02,159
control their events based on real time

1108
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:05,399
moisture level soil moisture level data

1109
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,719
and it kind of blows my mind that there

1110
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,240
hasn't been more research because these

1111
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,819
are multi-billion dollar industries that

1112
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:13,858
they haven't put more into this or done

1113
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,300
it and they really aren't like we're

1114
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:17,819
like the stuff we're doing is like

1115
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:22,140
sitting right on The Cutting Edge of

1116
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:24,780
like the most hyper efficient

1117
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:26,338
watering systems definitely and it's not

1118
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,720
I mean it's like yeah everybody likes to

1119
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:29,759
talk about how cool they are and

1120
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:32,098
everything but it's like it it really is

1121
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,500
like it's like what's happening here and

1122
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:38,720
it blows my mind that we're

1123
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,719
the ones doing it yeah

1124
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:50,399
they've always been really popular in uh

1125
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,559
Urban agriculture I would say like

1126
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,780
gardening stuff like that

1127
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,400
um I mean I my whole house is like a

1128
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,460
giant Garden basically and I use them

1129
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,519
and everything but

1130
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:05,159
it opens up

1131
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:06,838
a whole new realm of possibilities I

1132
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:09,358
would say yeah basically any container

1133
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:10,980
gardening of any size people haven't

1134
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:12,299
always have people have been using boom

1135
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,440
that's very extensive and for a very

1136
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,940
long time they've actually been around a

1137
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,380
lot longer than people think they've

1138
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,838
been

1139
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,358
um yeah I mean it's like a 50 60 year

1140
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:23,159
old company yeah well here's here's the

1141
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,078
answer your question you know the blue

1142
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:26,699
mats that we're using now they work

1143
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:28,740
really effectively because they're so

1144
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:31,199
sensitive in container growing like

1145
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:33,358
that's where we really like to see this

1146
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,338
particular product go into so raised

1147
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:36,960
beds pots things like that definitely

1148
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:39,358
some sort of like native like soil

1149
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:44,338
applications but

1150
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:48,119
um it's it's really using like like more

1151
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:49,559
beefy heavy duty uh tensiometers that

1152
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,960
actually control electrical switches

1153
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:54,358
because that's you really you kind of do

1154
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,059
need that to

1155
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:58,799
run scale to run at scale like I mean

1156
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:01,980
when I say scale I'm talking like

1157
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,359
hundreds of Acres you know so like the

1158
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,059
flow rates the pressures that are

1159
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:08,519
involved in that that's like heavy duty

1160
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:10,078
it's all engineered it's it's and we

1161
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:13,739
mess around in that world we do we do

1162
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,599
projects that big but it's um

1163
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:17,399
it's just not as honed in as you'd think

1164
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,079
it would be and and it's one of those

1165
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,539
things you look at like

1166
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:23,579
whatever like climate change the world's

1167
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:25,739
falling apart like

1168
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:28,019
if we like smart people don't like step

1169
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:29,818
up and fix things we're all fucked which

1170
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:33,358
I think is true

1171
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:35,818
um like like this is something that I

1172
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:37,619
think needs more like resources and

1173
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:40,259
areas you know like just and Just Energy

1174
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:42,358
put into it definitely yeah and I think

1175
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,680
it's starting to coming from uh just one

1176
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:45,358
it's one thing yeah one thing about

1177
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,679
among many like how do we produce like

1178
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,139
electricity and how do we do all this

1179
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:51,239
other stuff but like you know like how

1180
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:52,318
do we conserve water and and use water

1181
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:54,539
to like

1182
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,338
as efficiently as possible yeah it would

1183
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:59,039
be really exciting to think that like

1184
00:43:56,338 --> 00:44:01,980
you know weed growing cannabis dudes

1185
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:04,019
playing around with blue mats could

1186
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,000
maybe make an effect on something but

1187
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:07,139
the thing is they always that's the

1188
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,099
thing about cannabis Growers like

1189
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:12,420
cannabis Growers have always been the

1190
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:15,119
most advanced gardeners in the world

1191
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,039
like they've always had the money and

1192
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,599
the resources and the time the space and

1193
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,219
the scale like the smaller scale that

1194
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:22,500
they're working on and I mean you know

1195
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:25,939
it's of course like

1196
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,940
remember Izzy back in the day

1197
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:30,779
if somebody was like making four

1198
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,880
thousand dollars a pound

1199
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,859
it did what it's not that hard to grow a

1200
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,380
pound of wheat like and you make four

1201
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:39,838
thousand dollars for it and you if you

1202
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,160
do that a lot you have a big pile of

1203
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:43,380
money and you have a lot of money to

1204
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:45,299
play with and you can really test things

1205
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,579
and do things and that's again a nice

1206
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,380
funny ideas yeah and like cheese funny

1207
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:51,000
ideas and do things I mean The Cutting

1208
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,920
Edge of like everyone else to like try

1209
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,900
this experimental product that they've

1210
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,280
you've never heard of before and that's

1211
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,900
how we kind of got started and then we

1212
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,099
you know we got more experience and they

1213
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,019
got more experience and everybody now

1214
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:03,180
now it's like weed world's not four

1215
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:05,460
thousand dollars a pound uh we're like

1216
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:10,338
you know a tenth of that since a lot of

1217
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,338
places but the the point is like

1218
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,880
the Cannabis producers especially like

1219
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:21,300
under black market conditions like

1220
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:24,240
pushed a lot of boundaries that that

1221
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,400
gave that I gave a lot of data to us

1222
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,379
and other people to other Technologies

1223
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,380
and it

1224
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,880
yeah I mean that's just yeah they were

1225
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,599
the best funded gardeners for a long

1226
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,500
time

1227
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,660
and um and had money to burn and so cool

1228
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:42,480
stuff happened as a result I like to

1229
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:43,799
think of LED lighting as um sure a

1230
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,440
really good example of that just because

1231
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,900
you know working in I've worked in this

1232
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,460
really state-of-the-art Greenhouse at CU

1233
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,318
Boulder and everything was like super

1234
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,019
super state of the art except for the

1235
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:58,139
lights were all HPS you had these like

1236
00:45:55,019 --> 00:46:00,780
unbelievably expensive systems in place

1237
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:02,519
and a lot of my friends growing in their

1238
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,380
weed clot like like growing in their

1239
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:06,838
closets had like far more advanced

1240
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:10,318
lights than this multi-million dollar

1241
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:12,000
funded you know University Research

1242
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:14,639
Center yeah

1243
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,260
um because you know people don't catch

1244
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:17,639
on until a little bit later and yeah

1245
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,220
yeah that's and then you compare that to

1246
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:21,420
like an onion farmer or like you know

1247
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:23,399
like corn Farmers stuff like they're

1248
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,599
like their margins are just like razor

1249
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,220
thin they got to do everything as

1250
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,920
cheaply as possible they're not taking

1251
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:30,358
risks they're not doing things to really

1252
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,858
push the envelope unless they're getting

1253
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:34,318
some sort of federal funding to do an

1254
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:37,380
experiment which you know yeah that's

1255
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,759
good but it's you know yeah and I think

1256
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,079
you know Greenhouse is where you see

1257
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,240
this I mean I've been finding a bunch of

1258
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,680
tensiometer research from like the 80s

1259
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:44,759
and 90s

1260
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:46,199
um you know it's not like a novel

1261
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,780
concept of something people haven't been

1262
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:49,919
doing it in in a research setting it's

1263
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,640
just

1264
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,639
it

1265
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:56,879
it's never really been adopted like into

1266
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,079
scale which is really interesting

1267
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,940
because I've been finding all these

1268
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:04,440
reports from decades and decades ago

1269
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:06,780
about 120 water savings 66 increases on

1270
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,000
efficiency in tomato greenhouses where

1271
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,160
these things have always been there but

1272
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,838
and we're not starting it like flood

1273
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:14,639
irrigation you're starting to get highly

1274
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:16,500
efficient highly efficient irrigation

1275
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,759
the efficient drip irrigation yeah and

1276
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,199
people don't realize how much of the

1277
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,819
irrigation in the United States at least

1278
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:24,480
is still flood irrigation I think really

1279
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:25,920
it has to get done by necessity and you

1280
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,420
see a lot of like these like Austrian

1281
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,039
products and like these products coming

1282
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,720
from Europe I think it's really

1283
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,639
interesting their labor prices are so

1284
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:34,618
high that they've always had to sort of

1285
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,659
lead an automation because they can't

1286
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,099
like afford to pay all these people with

1287
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:41,358
these high labor rates where the US is

1288
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:44,280
always sort of like Brute Force yeah

1289
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:47,098
labor pools from like you know

1290
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,740
marginalized populations yeah so I think

1291
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:51,420
you know getting

1292
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:53,818
getting really good tools can make like

1293
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,900
a big impact I guess long story short

1294
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:57,358
and we're seeing like a lot of cool

1295
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,039
movement in that direction

1296
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:02,779
um yeah

1297
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:06,420
one thing I guess just to talk on the

1298
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:09,000
applications that you can do with

1299
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,680
moving the moisture contents around with

1300
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,719
pressures and it's yes I know it's a

1301
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,358
buzzword but I'm just talking about crop

1302
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:17,098
searing so Co-op steering to me is just

1303
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:18,539
targeted irrigation events it's been a

1304
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,640
thing for a long time came out of the

1305
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:22,858
Tomato world

1306
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:25,559
and it's the concept of using certain

1307
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:27,119
moisture contents at certain times as a

1308
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:28,500
way of enacting stress on the plant

1309
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,140
because crop steering is not just about

1310
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,119
irrigations about all the factors but

1311
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:36,059
water is a really common way of doing it

1312
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,559
to influence certain plant responses so

1313
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:39,480
you know in a really simplistic way of

1314
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:41,400
looking at it veg is like hot and humid

1315
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,400
lots of irrigation events much wetter

1316
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,980
soils flour you might want to start

1317
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,019
influencing the plant with some stress

1318
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,639
and it's not to say you make your plants

1319
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:52,800
grow in these like stress conditions

1320
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:55,078
it's sort of like you're introducing

1321
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,180
them to the concept that there is

1322
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:59,039
scarcity in the world like a plant

1323
00:48:57,179 --> 00:49:01,379
that's only ever gotten like the perfect

1324
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,119
conditions all the time is sort of just

1325
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,140
like it's a spoiled yeah it's a spoiled

1326
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,579
child it thinks there's unlimited

1327
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:07,259
resources it's not like you don't give

1328
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:09,180
them the resources but it's like taking

1329
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,099
that kid that you have that doesn't

1330
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:12,480
realize everything you're doing for them

1331
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:15,119
and like just give them like a taste

1332
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,920
that there is a difficult world out

1333
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,420
there and so that's one thing that's

1334
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,760
really cool with these blue mats is it's

1335
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,500
a really really effective way of crop

1336
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,300
steering or being the ability to move

1337
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,699
these moisture contents around because

1338
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,500
the one thing with a lot of steering is

1339
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:30,299
it's targeted drybacks and if you're

1340
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,099
purposely drawing out your media the

1341
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,680
problem is if not everything's exactly

1342
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:37,859
the same and you're in your moisture in

1343
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:39,239
your containers sorry then you might dry

1344
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:40,858
a lot of them out you're trying to dry

1345
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:42,598
them as far as you possibly can before

1346
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:43,980
it's just getting down to like yeah

1347
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:45,300
almost permanent welting but not quite

1348
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,800
but what happens if they're not all the

1349
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,480
same that means a fair number of those

1350
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,680
might actually get pushed over the point

1351
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,500
where now they're really getting messed

1352
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,838
with so this forces the moisture content

1353
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,519
to stay static where you want it so it's

1354
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:58,679
not like oh I've pushed it to this

1355
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:00,480
dryness level now moving it wet again it

1356
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:02,399
might still be irrigating the whole time

1357
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,559
it's just irrigating more and less to

1358
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,780
hold that moisture content so you know

1359
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,338
you're gonna stay at 150 as long as

1360
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,940
you're at 150 you know you're going to

1361
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:14,639
stay at 50 as long as you're at 50. and

1362
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,500
that allows you to move things back and

1363
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,779
forth knowing things are staying the

1364
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,838
same for every single pot which has been

1365
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,760
for me the biggest problem with with

1366
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:27,000
steering is that like people can't get

1367
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:29,579
accurate enough information to actually

1368
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,838
often do this without paying humongous

1369
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:32,460
amounts of money

1370
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:34,858
I think I really like doing at this

1371
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:37,318
company is helping people gain access to

1372
00:50:34,858 --> 00:50:40,380
problems with lower cost easier to adopt

1373
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:41,759
Solutions and like helping small farmers

1374
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,960
um this is a really good example of it

1375
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,400
you know another one being like

1376
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,619
everyone's paying all these money for

1377
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,420
netaflexes and systems that treat runoff

1378
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:50,099
whereas diplomats don't create runoffs

1379
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,358
so rather than paying three hundred

1380
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:54,660
thousand dollars for a system and

1381
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:56,159
another 200 000 for a consultant you can

1382
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:57,899
pay the same amount as a normal

1383
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,879
irrigation system and achieve the same

1384
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,800
thing pay a lot less though yeah yeah

1385
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,119
actually so but anyways I think this is

1386
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,640
really what we wanted to cover these are

1387
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,960
the points yeah yeah and you know I

1388
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:08,639
think I'm going to be laborer too much

1389
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,380
but like this is the this is these are

1390
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:11,460
the new things and like we really want

1391
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,079
people that like that have ever had

1392
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:16,079
problems with blue Mass to call us and

1393
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:18,960
fix yeah there's not a question yeah

1394
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,780
that we can't that I'm afraid to get I

1395
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,400
have we have now after all the same

1396
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,440
questions yeah it's always the same

1397
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,680
questions it's always the same and now

1398
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,260
we have the right answer so yeah so it's

1399
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:33,960
uh you know I think

1400
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:36,300
uh it's a really yes it's anybody call

like us in an office

1405
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,899
yeah and we're either talking about blue

1406
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,019
mats with each other or we're answering

1407
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:54,720
calls or yeah and we're trying to get it
