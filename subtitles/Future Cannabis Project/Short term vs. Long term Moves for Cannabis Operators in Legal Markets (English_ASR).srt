1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:09,480
[Music]

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,509
are you still planning to cultivate are

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,429
you just going to let it go fallow for a

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,138
year actually I'm gonna go probably take

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,879
it all out I brought a permaculture guy

6
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,618
in from Layton from the permaculture

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,210
conference I was involved in so he flew

8
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,070
in yesterday and took a look at my

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,689
property and we're gonna start getting

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,368
ready to play a radish all over the

11
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,899
benches because everything regressed in

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,309
form although because I did the initial

13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,198
work a couple years ago so the whole

14
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:34,799
thing is all grass in so you're gonna

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,510
grow radishes hey Madison but I can

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,640
bring out the soil then that I can mulch

17
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:41,159
it in and what it will do is it'll let

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,929
me start building soil because see the

19
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,328
thing is that if you follow Colorado

20
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:47,460
Oregon Washington model the first year

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,049
first year and a half and two of legal

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,329
everybody got paid really well because

23
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,799
there was this shortage of product that

24
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,439
could move into the system through

25
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,819
regulated people with California because

26
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,589
California made the deal with law

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,039
enforcement to allow each kind of need

28
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,978
to have its own control over the market

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,650
in that County 65% of California is a

30
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:10,019
desert and so where you have storefronts

31
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,100
they're concentrated and in places like

32
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,379
Humboldt where you're gonna have a

33
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,478
couple in barbourville red way that you

34
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:19,379
go to arcana for - they're not for tuna

35
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,118
but Rio down then you go into Arcadia

36
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,379
Rica area would they be like you know 10

37
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,239
there - by the time you're done you can

38
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,158
have like 40 dispensaries inaudible

39
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,599
county total like watch how many they're

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,670
gonna really build it up in 3 or 4 in

41
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,140
Rio down you're going to have there's a

42
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,060
new one open and the nice one - there's

43
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,530
a nice dispensary in red way I just

44
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,670
drove by can't wait to go inside it's

45
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,939
gorgeous it's called the Country Club

46
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,469
and good looking spot so I'd love to go

47
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:41,728
in there and check it out but you got

48
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,408
one there I think they're gonna pop one

49
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:46,379
here there'll be one up the road there's

50
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,759
mine then they'll be down the road so by

51
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,739
the time you're done how many will there

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,349
be if they'll be maybe 10 and arcade at

53
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,908
10 in Eureka that'll be 20 just within

54
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,129
that little distance McKinley Phil we'll

55
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,770
have a couple so you're gonna have in

56
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:01,408
Humboldt County with 120,000 people so

57
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:02,269
say 37 over-exaggerating 40 said we have

58
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,850
30 toll

59
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:07,519
how many that means very 4,000 people

60
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:11,000
you have a dispensary that doesn't work

61
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,709
in a rural area it just doesn't and so

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,459
you have places like Humboldt that are

63
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,459
popping up stores everywhere but there's

64
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,659
no population here if we had a million

65
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,939
200,000 it'd be incredible for the store

66
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:24,139
owners but the store owners about to

67
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:25,400
take a real beating because they're

68
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,779
gonna compete with each other to the

69
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,879
death over who's gonna be able to get

70
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,818
the cheapest pot and then you get to a

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,739
point where it gets down to a 1 percent

72
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,000
margin like Walmart then you got

73
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:36,049
companies that like the one that just

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,849
popped up in Arcata

75
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:39,739
where they're doing delivery only where

76
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,479
it's basically the Costco a weed because

77
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:43,099
what you do is you pay them a membership

78
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,869
fee and the membership fee to them

79
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,389
allows them to just deliver it to you

80
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,209
direct so you can get away from the

81
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:52,339
nasty stores because they overcharge you

82
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,200
much 400% unlike would have been put in

83
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,269
florid four hundred more times on the

84
00:02:54,199 --> 00:03:02,238
price it's not really true in every one

85
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:04,549
has a cost of production and so when you

86
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,900
when you create a system where you don't

87
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:08,120
allow the whole state to have

88
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,230
storefronts and you have these huge

89
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,480
deserts and you favor areas that can

90
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:16,849
produce massive quantities of cannabis

91
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,289
before that you allowed the industry to

92
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:20,389
kind of stabilize my movies it was

93
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:21,439
supposed to be a five-year delay but

94
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,969
anything over an acre

95
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,530
well that anything over an acre you

96
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,509
would still don't have anything over an

97
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,659
acre each each you could have multiple

98
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:32,780
acres but you can't have a 40 acre grow

99
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:35,659
you can have 40 contiguous acres where

100
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:38,539
they touch but it's not one plot of 40

101
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:40,489
its zoning if it's it's it's semantics

102
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:43,009
but the bottom line is let's get around

103
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:44,900
that issue so what you have is you have

104
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:46,578
mega producers producing and they're

105
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,719
burning investment dollars so most of

106
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,189
these big companies aren't making any

107
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,560
money at all they're losing money and

108
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:52,579
they that's the strategy and we've been

109
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,109
saying this for years that's a no

110
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:55,280
legardie model when I took a look at

111
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,930
this years ago I said look let's there'd

112
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,849
be no Legarda model you're gonna have a

113
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,010
few big companies come in and price war

114
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,269
everybody out of existence and then as

115
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,560
soon as everybody's going they'll raise

116
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,780
the price as to what works for them

117
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,849
that's the oil companies so you have two

118
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,159
or three major refineries - three major

119
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:10,439
producers everybody else buys gas for

120
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,049
them

121
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,389
price is the same everywhere you go

122
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,549
regionally same thing here with cannabis

123
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,560
and so for us you know that the only way

124
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,669
we can survive in a way we'd be talking

125
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,160
about this is to do digital

126
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,780
survivability where if you're in

127
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,820
Michigan and you're in the cherry areas

128
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,259
get together with all your other farmers

129
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:30,209
if you're in southern Humboldt you're in

130
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,039
this for this record valley this is the

131
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:34,589
center strip through the ill River if

132
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,840
you're over in palo verde that's a

133
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:39,810
different appellation if you're in you

134
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,149
know southern Mendocino hotter drier if

135
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,920
you're in Trinity all those places have

136
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:46,049
unique characteristics and they're

137
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,000
pretty clustered each one of those

138
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,410
groups those gardener's those farmers

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,949
have to work together in some capacity

140
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,900
and form their own alliances so that

141
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:57,750
what you can do is you can share IP you

142
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,549
can share assistance and labor and you

143
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,170
can get yourself to more efficient model

144
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,759
the dream of us all being owner

145
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,199
operators and running our own little

146
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,719
farm and be able to make money and have

147
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,159
a brand a brand means people know who

148
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,200
you are doesn't mean you have a hat and

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,210
a t-shirt and these people recognize you

150
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,500
and how do they recognize you and what

151
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:15,569
you're going to drive it every store in

152
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,699
the state you're going to go drive it

153
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:20,699
they move the pound last month so you

154
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,529
each each place moves a pilot a month so

155
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,319
you've got you know 12 stores move 12

156
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:27,619
pounds you group hours in homes yeah and

157
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,629
yet the two work together the

158
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,139
co-operative model as California has it

159
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:35,939
right now is is somewhat cumbersome I

160
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,479
mean there's a four acre limit in terms

161
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:42,750
of exactly you have to be only ten

162
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,270
thousand square feet or lower as an

163
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,639
individual farm and then collectively

164
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:50,370
you can't be over four acres so you're

165
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,199
still put at you know it's still a

166
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,790
cumbersome process and an additional

167
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,709
cost to go through to become a

168
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,600
cooperative it lets you be about 16

169
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:59,819
people because you got if you can only

170
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,070
have four acres and it's 44,000 square

171
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,769
that gives you about 16 people per group

172
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:06,990
so if you just choose the 16 people you

173
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:09,418
grew up up with but the additional time

174
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,129
of working together is 16 individual

175
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:14,579
owner-operators isn't it what you have

176
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:15,990
to put your choice yeah Donegal porn you

177
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,149
can do it on your own show me how

178
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,579
gonna do this on your own show me sure

179
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:22,949
that there's the model of like flow

180
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:25,169
Coty's coming in as the largest

181
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:29,550
distributor amount or in California

182
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:32,520
currently and they they're sort of

183
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:36,090
looking at the Sunkist model where all

184
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:39,959
the orange farmers are branded under

185
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:42,810
Sunkist orange juice you buy orange

186
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,489
juice it's it's a Sunkist but it comes

187
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,470
from different orange farmers but are

188
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,689
the orange farmers getting the profit or

189
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,130
is Sunkist the company getting the the

190
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:52,019
arty of the profit that's a question

191
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:54,029
when it comes to some a model like Flo

192
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:56,879
but even no matter how you look at it

193
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:59,549
though AG is that the farmer always gets

194
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,019
screwed in Ag it's just it's what it is

195
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,939
and so you that's why you have to have

196
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:05,279
multiple permits you can't just be a

197
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,019
farmer the dream to be a farmer is a

198
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,789
dream but the reality is you're in the

199
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:11,939
lowest price point of the entire supply

200
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,040
chain so Flo Ken has got a choke hold on

201
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:16,290
the sun-grown because they're basically

202
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,030
beating everybody by price so if you

203
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,260
want if you get flow counter products

204
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:21,569
through the distributor they're lower

205
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,009
than other sun-grown models it makes it

206
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,019
difficult for other distributors to

207
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,579
compete with them because not every

208
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,099
distributor can afford to lose a million

209
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,599
and a half a month so so Flo can is

210
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,770
bleeding a million and a half a month at

211
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,420
least from documents that got released

212
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:35,069
into the public now they don't they

213
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,170
don't they won't publicly address that

214
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,329
but documents got released and somebody

215
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,439
brought it up and then said hey look

216
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,269
it's it looks like you're losing a

217
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,439
million and a half a month and so if

218
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:46,560
you're losing a million and a half a

219
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,480
month then how exactly is anyone

220
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,060
supposed to compete with you at that

221
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,830
level so if your model and I understand

222
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,040
this because basically like I said

223
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:58,469
earlier that that is the model of new

224
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,540
business is its price war it's can you

225
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,850
get enough investment so that you can

226
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,000
bleed everybody out long enough to

227
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,980
outlast them and so the thing is that

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,990
yeah you can flick Hannah's grab enough

229
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,910
farmers and putting them to work but are

230
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,250
they are those farmer and I don't know

231
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,380
I'm not involved with looking but I

232
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,699
don't seem to see people jumping up and

233
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,360
down I mean with the lead that they are

234
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,839
either so I would assume

235
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,610
that they're not getting paid very well

236
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,288
because if your company is losing money

237
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,150
the idea that they're paying you a lot

238
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:31,610
of money to lose money doesn't make any

239
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,348
sense to me it's more a strategy of

240
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,778
let's get the bottom line as low as

241
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,550
possible and then let's dump and then

242
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:39,740
that way we can get market share and

243
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,509
then hopefully market share converts

244
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,329
into value of business and then that's

245
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:47,120
an acquisition model I don't see because

246
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:49,969
it mean with the price for the farmer I

247
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,940
mean ultimately go up it could possibly

248
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,019
go up in time but I look at Oregon as

249
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,910
the for individuals that have

250
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:01,310
recognition like Washington only couple

251
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:03,078
farms are really making good money you

252
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:04,578
know what's that fat panned up there I

253
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:07,789
was doing really well because they put

254
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:09,049
that pan to do drop the price in half so

255
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,669
when they came into the industry the

256
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:14,120
first thing they did was cut it from 60

257
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:16,969
to 30 instantly when price war grabbed

258
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,778
huge market share use that to drive

259
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,509
their infrastructure in advancements so

260
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:24,828
they can operate at that level but if

261
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:26,539
you're not able to operate at that level

262
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:30,588
where you can drop your price by half

263
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:32,689
press wore it out grab share and then

264
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:34,399
use the share to build so you can still

265
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,930
live at that margin how are you going to

266
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,610
do it see the problem with the small

267
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:38,689
farmers in our regions is that they had

268
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,278
to go through the same amount of

269
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,110
infrastructure development as anybody

270
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:44,208
that was a big mean in that if you had a

271
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,669
ward across and effects for your for

272
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:50,149
your you know 1,500 square foot heritage

273
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:51,649
farm I got 25 plants you still have to

274
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:55,009
go spend 50 grand to get that culvert

275
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:58,220
fix just as if you had an acre so there

276
00:09:55,009 --> 00:10:00,169
was no easement that's the political

277
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,028
thing here is that what made it easy for

278
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:04,099
you to do this no you didn't and you

279
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:05,448
didn't make it easy at all it's as

280
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,339
difficult as it could be and it's as

281
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:08,750
expensive as it could be so the smaller

282
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,459
farmers are going to get buried alive

283
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,528
that's where that that's been here

284
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:14,359
twenty five hundred five thousand you

285
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:17,059
know now you're talking forty farmers

286
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,039
form a collective because it's still

287
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:21,679
it's a it's for a core cap

288
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,689
and to me the only way that any bus any

289
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,269
bits are gonna do this is to work that

290
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,589
method I mean for me what I did for as

291
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,879
many years as I've been doing this is

292
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:30,380
I've been put in plants into people's

293
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,509
hands he couldn't get your hands on I

294
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,338
mean if it was red hot in the market I

295
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:37,009
had my hands on and I moved it into the

296
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:38,990
public right away and I didn't hold it

297
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:41,480
back for myself so only I could have it

298
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,940
I didn't look into the the grower world

299
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,909
so that this way we're always constantly

300
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,300
fresh and training so are you suggesting

301
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:52,789
for farmers to that are getting together

302
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:55,068
in forming cooperatives they're working

303
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:58,328
on that but they're growing similar

304
00:10:55,068 --> 00:11:01,068
cultivars so that they have a larger

305
00:10:58,328 --> 00:11:03,698
product two of the stalker or that's

306
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:06,019
only they're focusing on just a few

307
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:08,568
cultivars instead of a large variety

308
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:10,370
what is your advice my advice on that

309
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:12,528
would be if you have enough people you

310
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,778
have to realize that first you got to

311
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:16,458
figure out what's over produced so you

312
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:19,669
take a clear look at the market and you

313
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:21,078
say anything under 20% and numbers don't

314
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:23,299
mean a damn thing to me in terms of how

315
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:24,859
I smoke it but I'm being crystal clear

316
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,899
as a dispensary owner that stuff doesn't

317
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,000
have some numbers on it the market still

318
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,948
doesn't really care and it has no

319
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,389
extraction value so if you're not going

320
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:35,208
to have a certain amount of cannabinoids

321
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:37,220
present you can't blow the material you

322
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:39,500
so you can't have your tops move into

323
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,230
the world and all your lowers go because

324
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,539
if the numbers aren't prime the market

325
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,850
doesn't want to buy it so the market is

326
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:49,639
still numerically driven the numbers

327
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,129
alone the product won't move you have to

328
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,509
take a look at the nurseries that are

329
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,220
selling product is right now it's a

330
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:56,750
freak show track of traces of their play

331
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,220
they've got rid of they got rid of track

332
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,198
and trace here the SIP the system and

333
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,819
how what got whacked out metric hasn't

334
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:05,539
really kicked in fully because nobody's

335
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:06,889
really an Ewald yet but the nurseries

336
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:08,269
that are throughout the state

337
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,459
most of them selves are is similar

338
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,620
products whatever was hot and trendy in

339
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,729
their mind and so a lot of the farmers

340
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,549
were run in and get those the big

341
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,110
operations running and get those well

342
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:19,019
that's going to be a nice oversupply

343
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,810
come November

344
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,220
so these large monster operations starts

345
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,838
view and I mean they're they're dropping

346
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,570
some of these operations are good for

347
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,970
250,000 pounds a year so some of these

348
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,910
guys are dropping 12 to 20,000 pounds of

349
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,528
drop you don't want to be in that

350
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:35,939
wherever those varietals are that are in

351
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:37,980
those production models you don't want

352
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,930
to be in you need to be in something

353
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,759
that is a little differentiated so that

354
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:43,500
it's not fitting into that same mega

355
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,028
category because then you're going to

356
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,039
have to work off of efficiency they're

357
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:50,909
gonna get you on efficiency so you need

358
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:52,740
to go into things that are trendy in the

359
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:55,469
terms of what people desire that they

360
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,360
like fruits and Earth's that means like

361
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,100
in some kind of cherry pie lay it on top

362
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,419
of a cookie which is almost all these

363
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,610
new modern varieties that are

364
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:05,159
blisteringly hot or they're a sherbet

365
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:08,399
tied into something or it's an OG woven

366
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,838
into a fruit or it's it's the gorilla

367
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,000
glue because of the because of the

368
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,240
numbers and and the quantity is woven

369
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,649
into some kind of fruit little

370
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,589
differentiations so that you're not just

371
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:21,539
running the base varietal and if you can

372
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:23,570
get enough of the small farmers that can

373
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,669
produce at a similar production

374
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,290
methodology and are in similar

375
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:31,379
situations then what you have is enough

376
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:32,879
of that product to actually satisfy your

377
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,669
distributors where the distributors can

378
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,549
say hey listen we don't really don't

379
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:40,229
want to buy six pounds off you because

380
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:42,120
they're not filling niche dispensaries

381
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,829
what they would much rather have is

382
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,299
there is six hundred pounds of it

383
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:47,639
available so they can at least move the

384
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,500
supply chain and get it moved I think

385
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,019
that the major issue with this whole

386
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,208
problem for us is holding the product

387
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,970
once you've harvested it it does not

388
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:59,429
move through the chain quickly so what

389
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,050
you have to look at is first where do we

390
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:02,969
get differentiation where do we find

391
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,679
something that doesn't fit that doesn't

392
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,500
fit into the bigger picture but it's

393
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,929
desirable and then make sure the numbers

394
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,879
are hot if you got over three five on

395
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:14,399
the terms you got over twenty on the

396
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,259
numbers your your number looks good on a

397
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,798
shelf because those numbers drive

398
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:21,089
until the market the consumer realizes

399
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:23,720
that numbers don't really mean a lot

400
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:27,419
except an efficiency for extraction

401
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,399
we're kind of stuck with it and you have

402
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:30,989
to be Allah understand that if you go to

403
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,818
some of these big distributors some of

404
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:34,379
these big processors they have buildings

405
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:35,668
full of weed that are brown that is

406
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:38,009
sitting there because they can't move it

407
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:39,958
at the pace so you need to make sure

408
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:43,168
that your product is not overly

409
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:45,298
monoterpene dominant because the mono

410
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:47,909
turf is grateful fresh frozen where we

411
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:49,499
can freeze it we can extract it but how

412
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:51,749
much of that is moving and that's cheap

413
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:53,668
now too and so how much how much how

414
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:56,788
many people are really consuming fresh

415
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:59,938
frozen pen pens killing it but that's

416
00:14:56,788 --> 00:15:01,678
distillate in Terps combined the fresh

417
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:05,308
frozen model is for people who like to

418
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:08,009
smoke pho and it's not as many people as

419
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:09,269
it was the you just don't see it every

420
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:11,579
when I go to events I don't see the

421
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:15,149
torches everywhere anymore now like I

422
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:16,678
used to so that market was never massive

423
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:18,688
it was just hot so everybody's gonna

424
00:15:16,678 --> 00:15:21,269
shoehorn it into a tiny market you kind

425
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:22,918
of screwed so if you're gonna go into

426
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:24,239
that market you have to be model turf

427
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:25,198
driven but if you're going to go into

428
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:26,999
something that's going to sit for

429
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,828
five-and-a-half months before it moves

430
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,389
it has to have a couple of

431
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:32,638
characteristics that are important tasks

432
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:34,528
that an incredible density of flour so

433
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,480
that each time it gets handled in this

434
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:39,028
process it doesn't break apart into

435
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,449
pieces and it has to have a really good

436
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:44,970
deep rich sesquiterpene base so that it

437
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:46,858
holds flavor when it's consumed cuz most

438
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,329
of the stuff you see is damaged if

439
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,319
you're going to get into pre-rolls cuz

440
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:52,318
freerolls are hot

441
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:54,028
you better be crystal clear about who's

442
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:56,248
moving them in and what rate of speed

443
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:58,048
and that way you'd be able to determine

444
00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:00,989
how much of your product do you convert

445
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:03,629
to pre-roll and move versus how much do

446
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:05,309
you hold back and then when it's

447
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,619
appropriate because as soon as I grind

448
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:09,178
that I oxidize it like diminish it and I

449
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:09,690
hold it and it diminishes and by the

450
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:11,819
time it

451
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,950
to somebody it's a c-minus and it was an

452
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,840
A and from somebody who knows a

453
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,240
tremendous number of farmers and then

454
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,950
sells the product the difference in what

455
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,560
they grew and what I sold is so

456
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,150
different there's no word for it and

457
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:25,579
it's not the farmers fault the farmers

458
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,629
are looking like shit because of this

459
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,920
they're all looking like they can't grow

460
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:31,169
the outdoor guys don't know what they're

461
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,059
doing it indoors better if it's not it's

462
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:35,549
the indoor models or predator primarily

463
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,989
people that are much more funded you

464
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:39,149
could afford to spend a couple million

465
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,830
minimum to build an indoor model you

466
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:42,870
typically have other investment groups

467
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,639
around you tied into supply chain

468
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,230
management which means your product

469
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,960
moves quicker and more expeditiously

470
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,509
so indoor I'm looking at two months old

471
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,850
outdoor I'm looking at seven months old

472
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,679
so why is that because of the fun of the

473
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,629
fact that they don't have the money so

474
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,629
their funding doesn't allow them to have

475
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:02,850
enough licenses to speed this up and to

476
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:06,269
control the quality so if you look at

477
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,370
wine a state a state means all processes

478
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:10,199
controlled in-house and so in a state

479
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:11,879
model is always considered better why

480
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,500
and then sending it to a subcontractor

481
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,760
to process even though the

482
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,980
subcontractors going to do the same

483
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:19,680
process the idea is that you're

484
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,400
controlling the variables of quality

485
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,930
more definitively and so that's the

486
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,900
thing that I see with cannabis is that

487
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:30,360
until we have an ability to get product

488
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,830
held correctly in stasis so we don't

489
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:33,809
have deterioration of the product

490
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:36,779
holding it in in some black plastic

491
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:39,210
totes in a garage waiting to get

492
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,579
processed is not what I would call the

493
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,250
right method but what do you do you have

494
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:46,199
to have an extremely expensive

495
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,000
sophisticated system to hold so then

496
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,259
when we will pass it on to other bigger

497
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,240
entities and they'll do it they don't

498
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,339
have the facilities either and have a

499
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,549
temperature and humidity of control

500
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,990
whatever the level needed and for the

501
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:00,960
varieties because not every variety

502
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,269
wants the same control so the bottom

503
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,640
line is you happen to be very specific

504
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:07,470
and we're not would be very general and

505
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,990
what it's doing is it's just destroying

506
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,630
the perception of value of these

507
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,380
products so the customer becomes

508
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,240
dissatisfied with some

509
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,880
and they become satisfied with some

510
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,558
sun-grown parts that move through but a

511
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,690
lot of it is they keep going lower and

512
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,668
lower pricing and what it does is it

513
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,860
takes a lot of these small craft people

514
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:28,690
that produces some exquisite probiotic

515
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:30,490
ly grown you know regenerative ly grown

516
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,460
cannabis skin is that's environmentally

517
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,169
friendly people put a lifetime effort to

518
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,710
get that good they're producing

519
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:41,440
world-class pop but the consumer market

520
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,419
doesn't care because they figure hey for

521
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,110
half the price I can get something

522
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:49,150
pretty close they're going to do it and

523
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:50,379
I think that that's such an issue with

524
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,900
us right now that it makes these

525
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,210
conversations just you know what do you

526
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,009
do and I tell people hey if you're

527
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,200
asking my opinion on what I'm doing I

528
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:00,879
was gonna go crude and then I started

529
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,798
laying out the numbers the other day and

530
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,580
I realized I would be better to lose 15

531
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:08,408
grand than to lose a hundred grand and

532
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:10,359
that's maybe make it back so what I get

533
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:14,350
to do is I get to run my farm on here

534
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:15,009
and not get paid myself that doesn't

535
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:18,069
make any sense

536
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:20,230
and so I think that the long game is

537
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:22,538
especially places like Humble County

538
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:25,298
more than most places is that the brand

539
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:28,390
value of Humboldt is strong outside of

540
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:30,940
California not in California as much as

541
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,130
California the big markets SF in LA and

542
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,590
and those groups are caught up with

543
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,880
their own hype scene and so Humboldt

544
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:38,949
doesn't have because the each Beach

545
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,720
region is competing for who's the top of

546
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,610
the food chain well they don't want to

547
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,370
buy our product there neither does LA in

548
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:47,709
the same way small groups do the

549
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:50,349
education has to happen and the pricing

550
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,179
has to be correct but the farmers that

551
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:54,668
are growing here have to be able to

552
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:57,759
survive long enough to do it and they

553
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:59,730
also have to be able to realize like in

554
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,349
their initial conversation we had about

555
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,089
genetics the stuff that you have might

556
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:06,519
not be yours by the time you put it out

557
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:08,199
because utility patents from these you

558
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:11,788
know the Baucus group he's gotta go

559
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,590
around it like 17 18 peppers right now

560
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:16,359
utility patents before patents on you no

561
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:19,750
wonder one no mare scene they own that

562
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:23,168
it almost seems like a strategy that

563
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:26,230
you're suggesting is to pull back from

564
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:27,259
the farming if you can and focus your

565
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,259
energy

566
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:34,019
you know like let your hold your permit

567
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:35,819
and do all the hoops and the fees to

568
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:38,099
keep the permit alive but you can all

569
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:40,980
you can also file that you're not

570
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:43,769
growing and so you don't have to pay the

571
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,009
tax on the cultivation and then put your

572
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:51,299
energy into preparing for when the

573
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:54,000
markets open up both in the States and

574
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:56,730
eventually globally building that

575
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,400
business so you have the structure of

576
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,049
your business solid so you have what

577
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,150
your marketing and branding is going to

578
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:07,109
be what your relationships are going to

579
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:10,350
be what your message is stand out

580
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:12,509
globally really because we're looking at

581
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:15,539
the possibility of global trade in the

582
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:17,309
next 10 years and definitely state to

583
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,339
state trade we're already there's

584
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,839
already talked about trade between

585
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:23,970
California and Oregon and how would that

586
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,429
affect the market Wow because they have

587
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,039
such oversupply in Oregon so it's the

588
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,690
same same situation it's just that you

589
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,399
know how do you financially handle this

590
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,910
and so for me I mean I would back to

591
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,650
work

592
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,970
you know it's insulting so I mean I'm

593
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,220
traveling all over the place to make

594
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:44,430
money and it's sure the hell not what I

595
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:46,470
wanted to do but I I have made the plan

596
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:48,690
based off of

597
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,519
the other states that went legal i

598
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,830
followed how they operated and i said

599
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,750
hey there's a beautiful window that when

600
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:56,939
legality opens up there's this

601
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,220
incredible opportunity to capitalize pay

602
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,350
back your investment on the farm break

603
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,809
yourself even so now the farms not a

604
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:05,369
liability it's an asset most of these

605
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:07,139
farms of liabilities right now really

606
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:08,759
because most people didn't get their

607
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,340
there they haven't ducked the whole

608
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,500
secret key component done they haven't

609
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:15,599
done all the environmental so that you

610
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,519
have like two minutes benefit whoa it

611
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,829
makes everything else cheap the permit

612
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:24,539
is not expensive it is the work to get

613
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:25,980
the permit that's expensive and that was

614
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:28,139
something that I thought I'd be able to

615
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,750
recover and kalyn nobody can get a

616
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,030
business loan like every other business

617
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,259
no and we never expected that I never

618
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:35,910
expect a business loan so I never

619
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,279
expected any miracle to occur but I

620
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:41,160
expected California to follow the other

621
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,069
states in the same way when each state

622
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,410
had the same exact first year of

623
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:47,759
legalization all farmers got paid so the

624
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,170
first year in Oregon first year in

625
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,680
Colorado first year in Washington

626
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:54,300
farmers made money after that prices

627
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,840
went down and then we went into this

628
00:22:54,299 --> 00:23:00,149
overproduction the situation California

629
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:03,769
complete opposite which blew my mind and

630
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:05,790
I was wrong like I I built my farm and

631
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:07,740
aggressively went at it so that I could

632
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:11,309
recover the costs in the first year and

633
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,480
I just basically wiped out my capital so

634
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:14,579
what it did is it put me into a

635
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,200
situation where I realized all right

636
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:17,730
well where we are now because none of

637
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,850
this plan seemed that this doesn't make

638
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,410
sense and it's it's the largest cannabis

639
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:24,929
economy in the world probably is

640
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:27,380
California and we're probably the the

641
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,910
most inept in what we're doing and

642
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:33,020
regulatory regular like that's already

643
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,400
why it's you know and it's it's just

644
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:38,789
unbelievable and the kind of shopping

645
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,580
but we had this advanced watching

646
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:43,649
Colorado do it watching Washington do it

647
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:45,089
you know there was this possibility that

648
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:49,080
we were going to be the first because

649
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:52,139
that proposition fail prop 19 and then

650
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:53,759
so it seemed like you know people were

651
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,800
like oh well maybe this is a black

652
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,349
because we'll get to see the mistakes

653
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:01,139
made and yet Colorado and Washington as

654
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:04,649
Bessie as they bed and Oregon have

655
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:07,230
seemed to be better than California I

656
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,790
mean California is just the biggest shit

657
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,690
show well that's because we're so much a

658
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:11,250
bigger tennis

659
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,539
what is that's bigger it's much so much

660
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,819
bigger we making it with a years ago

661
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:17,190
make it count for making Colorado Oregon

662
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:20,460
and Washington look deliver and we are

663
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:22,019
and it just is so everything we do is

664
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,940
different because we're so powerful and

665
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:28,889
big as you know you have 40 million

666
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:30,390
people and there's money here so the the

667
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,220
way that you created the deserts

668
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,850
throughout the state just created a

669
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:38,190
disaster for sales and they didn't

670
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:41,039
people didn't really understand that the

671
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:43,440
society isn't so caught up on parody or

672
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,990
they wouldn't have fast food you

673
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,580
wouldn't have such an incredible obesity

674
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,019
and and lack of health in the country

675
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:50,279
because a lot of that's coming from the

676
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:53,099
food source what you're eating you're

677
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:54,629
being poisoned well if people can I mean

678
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:56,579
I think there's a hope that people are

679
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:59,070
waking up to that and there are a lot

680
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:02,339
there you know or less organic food is a

681
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:04,619
huge market you know it is why do people

682
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:07,259
do there is a huge market in the Bay

683
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:09,029
Area and there's people that will only

684
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,009
eat organic food but we're talking about

685
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:13,649
less compared to the regular market so

686
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:16,019
huge compared to what regular so organic

687
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,150
is how big a ratio compared to regular

688
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:20,250
going at local supermarket tell me how

689
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:22,350
big the organic aisle is tell me how big

690
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,930
the supermarket is there's a it's a

691
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:27,359
substantial niche yeah it's a niche

692
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:29,039
though yes it's a niche and who is in

693
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,319
that niche if it was in any of these

694
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,450
rural regions it was pot growers fuel in

695
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:36,409
it and I said this B is I believe a

696
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:39,259
cannabis organic cannabis production

697
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,130
drove organic food production

698
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:42,629
simultaneously because the people who

699
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,520
were growing wheat organically were like

700
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,470
hey we want to buy organic food it

701
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,210
became a market they could afford it but

702
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,490
right now I noticed that the liquor

703
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:54,870
store is selling a lot more pizza than

704
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:56,789
normal and cuz I'm there because it's

705
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:59,079
cheaper you can afford it it talented

706
00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:01,829
you don't you know what's in it

707
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:04,868
versus a lot of the restaurants and

708
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:06,970
restaurants in town have you know a

709
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:09,759
largely organic food it's oh it's more

710
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,470
expensive double-double and so the thing

711
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,960
is can you afford it and does it do do

712
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,989
the people who buy organic produce smoke

713
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,489
a lot of pot who buys pot that's this is

714
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:20,259
a magnetic question that men is trying

715
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:24,850
to get you know sophisticated stoners

716
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:26,528
that's an oxymoron it is because stoners

717
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:29,199
historically of blue-collar workers

718
00:26:26,528 --> 00:26:31,148
they're people who work hard and they

719
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,980
use cannabis because it allows them to

720
00:26:31,148 --> 00:26:35,168
have very little side effects the next

721
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,149
day it lets them relax it lets them have

722
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:40,119
some kind of a theory or move you know

723
00:26:37,148 --> 00:26:41,979
moment after work lets their body well

724
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:44,168
but wealthy don't smoke a lot of pot

725
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,989
they never have they like cocaine and

726
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:48,190
champagne and opiates and that's not

727
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:50,259
what we're making and that's not what

728
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,149
we're selling and so the blue-collar

729
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:53,710
individual in America is the one who

730
00:26:52,148 --> 00:26:55,148
buys the predominant amount of cannabis

731
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,548
if you want to see places that move a

732
00:26:55,148 --> 00:27:00,758
lot of weed they're not in Beverly Hills

733
00:26:57,548 --> 00:27:02,048
they're in Compton Compton dispensary

734
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,819
moves more weed than Beverly Hills

735
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:05,319
dispensary never the hills are doing a

736
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:06,970
lot higher price point but they're

737
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,259
definitely not moving the same quantity

738
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,649
a week coming out of those shops in

739
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:14,009
Compton because the the people that are

740
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:16,479
living in in those type of situations

741
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:18,639
the lower priced cannabis works I'm from

742
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,069
I'm from blue-collar New England so I

743
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:22,898
grew up in a blue-collar reality I think

744
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:24,759
on it wasn't raised and when wealthy

745
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:27,608
Humboldt County where there was money

746
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:30,509
bubbling out of the ground like wells so

747
00:27:27,608 --> 00:27:33,939
what you have here is this really odd

748
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:37,058
it's not accurate it's a reflection of

749
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,639
an in in an accuracy that people that

750
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:42,339
are regular have money this is regular

751
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:43,839
people who had money no longer to any of

752
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:45,668
the grower communities have money go to

753
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,658
any grower community in the California

754
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:47,409
and ask them are you doing well

755
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:49,480
financially

756
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:50,799
tell me anyone raise their hand and say

757
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,599
yeah I'm doing great I'm making money

758
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,759
like my business is thriving

759
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:56,168
very very few cultivators some

760
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:58,089
distributors are doing well some

761
00:27:56,169 --> 00:28:00,850
extractors are doing well couple stores

762
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:03,189
are probably doing well process

763
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:05,409
and all that kind of stuff secondary

764
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:07,870
outside of cultivation the cultivators

765
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:09,730
show me anybody that's doing well and in

766
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:10,899
those regions and this is a change in

767
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,370
the last five years

768
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,710
obviously out last couple years in its

769
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:16,929
nationwide I mean I go around the US and

770
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,539
I see it across the u.s. that you're

771
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:21,850
seeing changes in global economy you're

772
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:23,559
seeing it in all the type of businesses

773
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:26,109
that your amount of money that you make

774
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:28,269
in any job is decreased versus

775
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:31,209
management so management and radically

776
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:32,470
change in what they make workers rather

777
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,210
than changing what they have

778
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,850
that's disposable income that directly

779
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:39,730
reflects it the chief markets are going

780
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:41,679
to become the ones the only way that a

781
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,980
we've survived as our little regions is

782
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,110
that we have us wide sales and we have

783
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,630
global sales and all we need is really

784
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:53,500
us at first because if you go to

785
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:56,980
anywhere from the Midwest down in the

786
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,259
southern region up they don't have the

787
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,000
ability to cultivate year-round like we

788
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:02,829
do and they most definitely have a

789
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,210
horrific time through the summer when

790
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:05,710
you would normally cultivate go to

791
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,630
Florida try to grow in ninety nine

792
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,549
ninety percent ninety degrees ninety

793
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,170
percent humidity tell me what you're

794
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:12,970
going to produce out there so you have

795
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,769
to go into it and so once you start

796
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:18,009
running these indoor operations your

797
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:20,319
cost of production skyrockets once

798
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:22,299
California and Oregon starts releasing

799
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:23,200
cannabis across the u.s. you think I

800
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,669
think these companies are going to

801
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,029
actually be able to compete price-wise

802
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:30,039
and so as a cannabis consumer when you

803
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:33,639
go to the store do you typically buy

804
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:36,430
Wagyu beef do you know you don't buy

805
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,350
forty bucks an ounce meat no as I say

806
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,880
you're a meat-eater but if you do you

807
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:42,609
typically buy what you can afford

808
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,950
very few people buy that they have to

809
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:47,379
advertise it to very wealthy or they

810
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,990
advertise it as a special occasion like

811
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,580
a graduation like a high-end bottle of

812
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,769
alcohol like you don't you may not drink

813
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:55,750
400 I love scotch but when you son

814
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:58,660
graduated you drank the bottle of scotch

815
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:00,970
so once every four years when it kid

816
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,570
graduates you buy one you got married

817
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,910
you got one

818
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:07,849
but mostly you're drinking Johnnie

819
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:09,380
Walker red and you know 20 bucks well

820
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:11,899
they wouldn't be selling so much of it

821
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,640
and so the problem of cannabis pricing

822
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,640
is that in order for people to pay

823
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,140
higher prices they have to understand

824
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,120
why they're paying and they have to have

825
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,480
enough exposure and with the new clients

826
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:25,399
that are coming in the new new customers

827
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,110
regular pot wipes them out so they get

828
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,250
high selling anything so they think a

829
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:30,409
little it's like alcohol when you were

830
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,150
12 and you first had your first beer you

831
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,950
didn't you're really a discerning Micro

832
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:36,470
beer connoisseur at that moment I only

833
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,990
like stouts you didn't know a damn

834
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,220
difference and so that's the problem is

835
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,529
that people that are coming in don't

836
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,029
have any experience with really quality

837
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:45,529
and it takes a minute to start to be

838
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:47,899
able to say well I got you the

839
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:50,509
aftertaste was radically different the

840
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,550
quality the high was better and man the

841
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:54,410
lucidity was better just better drug

842
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:57,649
cannabis it's a better experience

843
00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:00,529
cannabis well that takes a minute to get

844
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,030
that education and when people are

845
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:04,430
buying products most people are very

846
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:06,799
cautious about price very few people

847
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,039
just close their eyes and say I buy what

848
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,259
I want they look at the price tag and

849
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,509
that's the reality and so the problem

850
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:18,220
with it is trying to get it into some

851
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:18,220
level that works for the farmer

852
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:29,910
