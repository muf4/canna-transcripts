2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,378
hi my name is Alison justice and I'm VP

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,679
of cultivation and al collapse I also

4
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:19,250
own a 40 acre hip farm in South Carolina

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,198
along with an extraction facility I was

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,109
here at the cultivation classic today to

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,150
be on a panel with some of the industry

8
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:29,000
leaders to talk about production science

9
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:34,039
and then I'm gonna let my partner here

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,689
introduce himself hi giro court chief

11
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,520
product officer at pop in Berkeley we

12
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:39,769
are a California wellness company we

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,079
make topicals tinctures capsules and

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,359
pain relief patches all our products are

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,509
solvent list I'm happy to be invited

16
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:49,820
here to the cultivation classic it's my

17
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:52,189
first time in Oregon which is surprising

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,939
but you know a lot of great people here

19
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:58,629
a lot of aligned values around the

20
00:00:55,939 --> 00:01:01,189
future of cannabis and how we need to a

21
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:05,149
self-regulate so seeing the folks from

22
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:07,129
kind looking at evaluating farms since

23
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:09,140
you know the feds aren't doing it of

24
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:11,030
course you know talking about being on

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,649
the panel with Allison and just talking

26
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,968
about science and it was great to be

27
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:16,129
flanked by two scientists that are

28
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:18,169
data-driven where I'm kind of in that

29
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:20,509
weird mix where I have this CPG company

30
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,998
and some years of anecdotal evidence and

31
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:25,188
I'm just kind of plodding along as the

32
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:26,688
industry needs data so it's great to

33
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:28,548
have these panels and these talks where

34
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:31,368
we start to share knowledge because one

35
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,229
of the the best things about the

36
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:35,569
rollback of prohibition is the ability

37
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:37,489
to speak openly and share knowledge and

38
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,899
you know connect with folks that you

39
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:40,399
know just know different things and have

40
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,019
different approaches and every time you

41
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,819
meet them they grow your mind and and

42
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:48,259
hopefully you can do the same for them

43
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:50,060
so one of the things I wanted to touch

44
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,349
on a little bit with you specifically

45
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,659
was you know I absolutely agree that

46
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:58,909
this medicine works the best as a full

47
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:01,009
botanical so as a full plan so getting a

48
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,079
piece of a little bit of everything the

49
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:07,278
terpenes and the flavonoids the the

50
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:10,519
plant facts fats chlorophyll even but

51
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:12,840
you know it stresses me out how do we

52
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,120
determine that you know because

53
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,670
if you're growing under LEDs and I'm

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,709
growing under full Sun that same strain

55
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:22,469
it's gonna be different if you dry fast

56
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,789
and I dry slow the terpene profile might

57
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:26,580
become something completely different

58
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:28,979
than we intended depending on how we

59
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,349
extract if you do ethanol and I do co2

60
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,869
it's gonna be a different yield but then

61
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:34,649
even on top of that if we both do co2

62
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,420
extraction

63
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,129
well maybe use different times and

64
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:39,839
pressures and heat and so that's all

65
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:42,689
gonna gild something completely

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,629
different so you know when trying to

67
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:48,629
figure out how to standardize that with

68
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:51,750
it not being just the flower there's so

69
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:54,299
many variables that you know it's

70
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,620
exciting but at the same time it makes

71
00:02:54,299 --> 00:03:02,579
me question how we can standardize it to

72
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,360
the best of our abilities so I think the

73
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:07,019
answer lies in data collection and

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,970
luckily we have these things called

75
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,640
computers that love managing variables

76
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:13,560
right another complex thing is ourselves

77
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,818
and we're each different right so once

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,289
when we were sitting around at our

79
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:18,119
company we have these things call for 20

80
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:19,769
meetings where it's not a work meeting

81
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,939
it's kind of like exactly what is on

82
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,469
Wednesday afternoons where we just

83
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,318
vision and imagine what the world could

84
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:27,239
be imagine if we were able to not first

85
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:28,500
of all we do a poor job in our country

86
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,289
right now of tracking people's medical

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,549
history so if we had a device by which

88
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,620
we were tracking people's medical

89
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,409
history individual them as an individual

90
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,680
tracking what they use and it's complex

91
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:42,239
parts perhaps with enough data we would

92
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,950
start to be able to understand even

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,319
something as complicated as whole plant

94
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:47,250
medicine consistency is a really good

95
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,369
point

96
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,590
it can't natural medicine in general is

97
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,859
inconsistent right even if the same even

98
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,719
if you hold them all the variables the

99
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:58,739
same in a natural environment there's

100
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,049
gonna be shifts there's gonna be more

101
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,789
rain one year less rain more Sun less

102
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,379
for all these different things and then

103
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:06,239
the drying you know all the terpenes

104
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,159
that you know if we say that you know

105
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,810
THC and CBD are the engine or the

106
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,759
cannabinoids engine and terpenes drive

107
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,439
the ship if we go with that analogy

108
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,048
well those terpenes those volatile

109
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,209
organic compounds yeah they're exactly

110
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,009
that VOCs it's like a little bit of heat

111
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,089
a little bit of the way we store them

112
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,579
all of that will change their

113
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,859
composition right so we know also that

114
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,389
cannabis has had

115
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,610
this affects and I often think of that

116
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,889
as winning the lottery like for some

117
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,530
reason your physiology and the strain

118
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:35,629
that you came across created a miracle

119
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:37,549
for you so I hold that okay that that

120
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:40,129
miracle is out there there's a way to

121
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,259
get it but there as you put a variety of

122
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:45,349
variables that we can't quantify right

123
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:48,009
now to be able to reliably reproduce

124
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:50,810
that effect right so I would hope that

125
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,729
if I had to just vision I would say that

126
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,199
perhaps one day there will be a medical

127
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:56,269
tracking software that not only tracks

128
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:57,829
the individual patient but tracks the

129
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:59,778
products if they've used and they're

130
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:01,938
infinite variability and then over time

131
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:03,769
starts to point definitively towards

132
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:07,069
these specific things that are in common

133
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:10,549
over time that have worked for them and

134
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:13,278
we need good statistician to compile all

135
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,288
that data yeah it's funny in our company

136
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:17,899
we just now are building out our

137
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:19,818
data-driven apps our data-driven ops

138
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:22,908
people you know to start to track we get

139
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,840
a lot of feedback a lot of testimonials

140
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:25,908
and that while that's not a clinical

141
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,908
trial it's like our products have gone

142
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:30,740
from not using - you know we had a lady

143
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:32,629
in Richmond say that you know she unable

144
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,069
to walk upright for the last five years

145
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:35,419
started using our bomb and I'm like

146
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:37,789
while I know it's effective I'm like

147
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,258
whoo you know there's a huge placebo

148
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:41,300
effect going on with cannabis right now

149
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,650
that that also corrupts the data right

150
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,050
there are a lot of newbies that come in

151
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:46,788
and it's almost like their resistance

152
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,189
turns into a positive because the

153
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:51,139
placebo effect just completely you know

154
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,028
miracles are being created and so we

155
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,379
have to you know part of me as a

156
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:56,300
business person is like yeah put that

157
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:57,379
one up and then as a scientist I just

158
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,900
want to be like wait a minute

159
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:01,610
like slow down like we need to like be

160
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:04,188
able to recreate these experiences

161
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,889
before we can highlight them yeah so

162
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:09,139
data is key right and and and definitely

163
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:10,848
in the black market day data was not a

164
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,490
thing right and as you're building a

165
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:15,800
business data is not your first thing to

166
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,509
get but like and and we are in a nascent

167
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,669
industry so even an analytics around

168
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:21,110
market sharing stuff you know we

169
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:22,399
struggled to pay BDS because we're like

170
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,750
do we really need to do that or do we

171
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,299
just need to continue to stay on shelf

172
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,918
but we do need to do that we do need to

173
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,478
encourage people who are gathering data

174
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,370
whether it's at the register whether

175
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:34,038
it's at the clinician level because

176
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,399
without that we can't make educated

177
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,370
future decisions

178
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,918
right nothing that's data on every piece

179
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:45,959
of the puzzle right growing extraction

180
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:47,728
drying everywhere we need this data you

181
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,209
said you had a hemp farm in South

182
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:53,189
Carolina are you able to start to work

183
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:56,459
towards different cultivars that will

184
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:59,129
produce more oil rich products or are

185
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:02,129
the regulator's still trying to hold the

186
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:05,100
different cultivars to more agricultural

187
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:11,490
style hem South Carolina is amazing

188
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:12,960
my my varieties are 22% CBD you know

189
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,129
they're minor cannabinoids are upwards

190
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,668
of 5%

191
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:19,529
so yeah we're absolutely able to reach

192
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:21,948
out of that restriction zone a little

193
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:23,879
bit and that's due to the way the

194
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:27,720
regulations were written you know

195
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,350
looking at only Delta 9 you know giving

196
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,150
that opportunity that if you do go over

197
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,970
0.3% but you're under 1% you can

198
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:38,279
remediate in some sort of way so it has

199
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,849
give us a huge opportunity in terms of

200
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:44,668
breeding you know not being afraid that

201
00:07:40,848 --> 00:07:46,228
you know having that leeway of pushing

202
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:47,909
it a little bit but also not being

203
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:49,589
scared that you're gonna lose you know

204
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,750
your life savings in this farm because

205
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:54,029
they're gonna burn it down so yeah South

206
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,649
Carolina fueled the other southern

207
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,478
states have been really really great and

208
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,638
helping us to be able to expand on that

209
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,409
too to not just be stuck with these two

210
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,930
varieties that everybody else in the

211
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,270
whole you know us is growing and get

212
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,300
really creative you know terpenes up you

213
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:11,370
know above 2% it's just it's really

214
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,430
really great environment for for working

215
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:17,009
with him yeah I think it's important

216
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,478
just to note that that that's awesome

217
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:20,848
because I that was not the answer I was

218
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,469
expecting to be quite honest and it's

219
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:25,529
just important for everybody to know

220
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,870
that there is a way to growth CBD

221
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,129
cultivars that are federally legal but

222
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,199
you know kind of like I said in our

223
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,788
panel I don't really use the hemp word I

224
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,589
just it's all cannabis to me it's this

225
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:37,139
one plant and there are different

226
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:38,400
varietals and when you're talking about

227
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:39,778
producing medicine you should be looking

228
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,759
at the right varietal if you're talking

229
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,708
about producing cloth you should be

230
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,569
looking at that right right correct

231
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:47,589
varietal so it's good that the state is

232
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,090
giving you the latitude to grow the

233
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,490
that you need for what you're trying to

234
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,840
do so and yeah and with the farm bill

235
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,950
that means that you know perhaps I can

236
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,870
give you a call and get some of that

237
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,520
because our 50-state product right now

238
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,450
we source it actually out of Oregon and

239
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:05,019
we have used the cherry CBD and the F

240
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,740
cancer strain out of Colorado but yeah

241
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,539
that's awesome

242
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,370
and then one of the question you know my

243
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:11,250
next question would be does it wash well

244
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,120
I don't know if you've done any solvent

245
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,610
production but we are desperately

246
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,310
looking for that CBD cultivar that we

247
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,289
can do our ice water extraction with and

248
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:21,489
get you know a clean solvent list

249
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:24,279
extract that can be used as a

250
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,930
concentrate right now it typically the

251
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,039
yields it's possible of course but the

252
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:29,079
yields are so little that it's not

253
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,379
economically viable but that has to do

254
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,570
with the cultivar and so I can say this

255
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:36,669
our Bay aux produces great Keith

256
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:41,070
so haven't had a try to ice water hash

257
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:41,069
but would love to work with you

258
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:52,740
