2
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:19,289
the current recommendation on

3
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,439
cultivation is to restrict it to

4
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,449
artificial light growth only so they are

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,768
not allowing outdoor cultivation they

6
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,570
are not allowing mixed use within

7
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:29,189
greenhouses in any way shape or form and

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,179
for whatever reason they're not allowing

9
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,890
any type of licensed cannabis activity

10
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,558
on agricultural land so everything has

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,600
to be indoor it's a little silly because

12
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,339
within the committee we had we had an

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,809
operator come out good operator come out

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,020
and kind of tell us you know we got to

15
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:48,058
see how they run their indoor operation

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,530
and the indoor operation what we learned

17
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:51,359
are some facts on that the indoor

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,120
operation was about an 11,000

19
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,920
square-foot grow and we got some

20
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,709
statistics and data behind where it was

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,300
for their power usage on that because we

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,329
have concerns around this is gonna be an

23
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,709
eco-friendly thing so on to say nothing

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,260
about just taxing the grid in general

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,929
here what they ended up sharing with us

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,760
is that they did the math behind it and

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,760
said that for their 11,000 square foot

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,380
row if they were to transition to a

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,359
solar panel setup so they could be just

30
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,890
off the grid that way it would take them

31
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,469
the equivalent of 5 acres of solar

32
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,228
panels to power that on there and that

33
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:26,728
just makes absolutely no sense in any

34
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:28,289
way shape or form because part of what

35
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,030
the county is recommending is to use

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,770
renewable and renewable energy for that

37
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,450
but if you're gonna have to do it in a

38
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,819
warehouse location which is probably in

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,079
some populated city area on that where

40
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,118
you possibly gonna be able to get that

41
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:40,529
kind of square footage to say nothing of

42
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,180
the fact where does actually cost to set

43
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,310
that up so they want to force everything

44
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,390
to read industrial areas and it's a

45
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,909
little silly of a thought on that

46
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,519
because they want to see that as a way

47
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,478
of controlling the market and yet

48
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,679
historically the market went into the

49
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,140
industrial into the warehouse is a way

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,390
of hiding from all this stuff in there

51
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,799
and you know we had the chief of the

52
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,079
fire department who said that from a

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,299
safety point of view he preferred that

54
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,339
cultivation actually be done outside and

55
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,060
so we have all these other departments

56
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,830
are seeing the stuff in there and you

57
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,989
the directive has still remained to not

58
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,000
allow for any outdoor agricultural use

59
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,189
the Kappas they currently have right now

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,259
is it's 20 for retail 20 for delivery

61
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:19,239
and it's 10 for everything else so 10

62
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:21,280
cultivation 10 manufacturing and tab and

63
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,950
10 lab testing and 10 distribution and

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,360
again it's ridiculous for the population

65
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:30,250
size on that that doesn't add up

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,680
indoor capita 10 and then today do they

67
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:36,879
have a square footage cap like those 10

68
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,709
can in aggregate no no the the it's it's

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,299
just 10 licenses so with it's a 10

70
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,159
license and it's it's ridiculous all

71
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:43,629
around so let's say on that cap and that

72
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,310
cap would include whether their license

73
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:47,829
at a full acre well let's say it's in

74
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,479
door so you can only 220 220 2500 right

75
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,810
that's max license that you can get on

76
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:54,159
that correct okay so you have that max

77
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,870
so it could be a max of those or it

78
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,689
could be a max at only the 5,000

79
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,580
square-foot level you know and so that's

80
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:03,340
all in there and furthermore to go into

81
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,099
stuff there is intent and the county

82
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,379
wants to form a 15 person panel for

83
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:12,578
equity to discuss a discuss as equity

84
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:14,169
here their intent is not to they want to

85
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:18,790
set aside a percentage of licenses that

86
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:20,530
will go towards equity yeah certainly

87
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:22,629
certainly well I mean equity means a

88
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,299
variety of things what has been

89
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:26,889
historically so far in the topic let's

90
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,170
say city of Los Angeles seems to define

91
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,809
it as giving an opportunity for

92
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:33,699
ownership for a license to some of those

93
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,530
been previously affected by the war on

94
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:37,449
drugs mean they have a criminal record

95
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,400
or anything on that so should someone

96
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,958
been affected by having a cannabis

97
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,430
conviction and could not have

98
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,049
participated in the market or now they

99
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,849
actually get a leg up to participate in

100
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:47,230
a market by getting a license they'll be

101
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,989
reserved for them

102
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:51,638
in the county I'm I'm happy to see the

103
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,920
counties looking at a little bit more

104
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:55,269
we're at they want a wider lens on what

105
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,449
equity means it doesn't specifically

106
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,159
only mean you know ownership it could be

107
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:02,138
health stuff it could be other things

108
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,639
going forward there one of them we want

109
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,040
to see the county do is actually effect

110
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,540
a policy that would say that any county

111
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:09,759
employee could not get fired if they

112
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,989
tested positive for cannabis use so

113
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,939
that's kind of stuff that we want to see

114
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:15,069
a wider lens on equity for there but

115
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:17,180
within the specific model of you know

116
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:19,120
licences that would be given towards an

117
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,220
equity app you know applicants on there

118
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,259
they want to set aside a percentage so

119
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,630
if the percentage is let's say 20

120
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:28,699
percent they're matching that with a

121
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:30,050
panel that putting together of 15 people

122
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,269
so this whole panel they want to put

123
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,689
together 15 people to give let's say 20

124
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:37,370
percent of 10 licenses so that doesn't

125
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:38,600
seem to make any sense as to the

126
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,280
resource they would put behind something

127
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,689
and have such a low cap on their going

128
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,559
forward it seemed very disingenuous for

129
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:47,360
that is but the the issue again on the

130
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,709
cap being on there it's just from the

131
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,590
committee's point of view we address

132
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:53,569
that one of the recommendations we made

133
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:57,019
which the county has not seemed to have

134
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:59,209
taken into consideration yet is that we

135
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:01,099
said don't we wanted them to consider

136
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:02,479
alternatives to a cap and the

137
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,610
alternatives that we recommended is

138
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,920
because the county has so many different

139
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,139
communities some that may not want this

140
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,360
at all and others may want it a lot we

141
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:13,189
had recommended hosting a discretionary

142
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,290
hearing process so that way if an

143
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:16,969
operator comes into place and they want

144
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,050
to look at their the community still has

145
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,430
an opportunity to come out and say

146
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,660
whether they want them there or not and

147
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,939
that we thought was a better way to

148
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,290
adjust one of the proper levels as

149
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:26,209
opposed to putting an artificial cap

150
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,010
which at this moment really is that it

151
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:29,509
seems arbitrary there's really no reason

152
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:31,639
as to why they'd thrown out this 20 or

153
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:32,719
10 number on there and it's a little

154
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,550
silly on there too one of the other

155
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,460
recommendations we did which they kind

156
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,199
of seemed to implement but did not do it

157
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:40,489
for the reasons we did it for we were

158
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,099
concerned that there would not be enough

159
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,420
testing licenses or test laboratories in

160
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,340
place to be able to get product you know

161
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,290
healthy in and up in the market so we

162
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:50,750
what we recommend that they have a

163
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,660
reasonable number of testing licenses

164
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,490
versus the cultivation as it remains

165
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,780
right now they have a one-for-one so

166
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,129
they have 10 cultivation and 10

167
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:59,000
laboratory license essentially every

168
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:01,639
cultivator would get their own

169
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,899
laboratory that's that's awesome to some

170
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,009
degree which is ridiculous kids you

171
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:06,109
don't need that that's not what the

172
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,370
intent was behind what we did on that so

173
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,139
those are things when they're looking at

174
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,939
these caps it seems to be at this moment

175
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,300
I would like to think that it's more of

176
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:15,649
a test in the you know putting your toe

177
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,329
in the water right now for them to see

178
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:19,459
what is the right market you know right

179
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:20,509
size for the market because I understand

180
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:22,659
they may not know what is good for

181
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:25,000
cultivators and this and that but

182
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,730
makes absolutely no sense right and I

183
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,649
assume it it follows the same logic as

184
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:32,740
the retail there are currently more than

185
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:34,629
10 warehouse cultivators in the County

186
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,280
of Los Angeles you know when it comes to

187
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,990
the discussion of how large your market

188
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,219
isn't addressing with the proper amount

189
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,139
of licenses we speak with the

190
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,660
supervisors in there and some of them I

191
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,709
would say the majority of them are

192
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,630
surprised and happy to see that there

193
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:48,039
seems to be some data to say how big the

194
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,449
market should be certainly easier on the

195
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,590
retail side than anything else but at

196
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,990
least they have something to point to

197
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:54,669
and their intent is like one of the

198
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,800
things that they want to do differently

199
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,420
than the city of Los Angeles did is city

200
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,310
of Los Angeles did a roll out based on

201
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,650
license type so they did retail first

202
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,149
but there was no supply chain to support

203
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:05,109
it so where are you gonna get your

204
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:06,370
distribution where you gonna get your

205
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,259
product all that stuff in there

206
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,670
there was nothing legally within the

207
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:11,920
save in the county of LA mostly to get

208
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,020
that stuff the county is intent on

209
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,150
giving a full supply chain so they'll

210
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:17,979
give you your retail your cultivation

211
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:19,509
all that stuff going in there but it's

212
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,950
so limited that it doesn't make sense as

213
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:22,449
well - so that's why I kind of going

214
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,769
back on it's like the county doesn't

215
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,909
want to repeat others mistakes but they

216
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:32,199
seem to be thinking about new ones for

217
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:35,400
themselves crack supervisors

218
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:40,240
is just everyone dead set against

219
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:42,009
outdoor cultivation actually we've

220
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,480
learned differently initially when we

221
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,189
had the discussions last year the

222
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,290
keeping in mind that the outdoor

223
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:49,418
opportunities are primarily within

224
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,950
district 5 so supervisor barber she has

225
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:54,579
by far the largest district in the

226
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:55,959
county and that did you know initially

227
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:57,789
the discussions going from that office

228
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,799
was that they were concerned for you

229
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,180
know things such as water or this that

230
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,829
in the other and we've now learned from

231
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,900
the state Cir report and otherwise that

232
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:06,699
cannabis certainly doesn't consume more

233
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:09,159
water than any other crop that is

234
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,418
already in those markets and so that

235
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,800
discussion has not changed you know

236
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:13,779
we've had the recent discussions on that

237
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,960
and it seems to be more aligned with

238
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:19,569
it's a political decision so within the

239
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:23,289
county itself you have 21 Town Council's

240
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:24,849
and they don't really get much legal say

241
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,770
over or you know how things are run but

242
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,150
they do have certain certain parameters

243
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:29,158
they can run around and make certain

244
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:31,799
laws for their own town

245
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:33,538
if you will these Town Council's have

246
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,099
influence over the supervisors but the

247
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:37,500
surprise still get the last say on that

248
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,000
and what seems to have been happening so

249
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,408
far right now that these Town Council's

250
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,349
have been saying they've been against

251
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:44,789
this and the discussions in the county

252
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,959
as they go out to discuss with them as

253
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,578
we've gone out there to discuss with

254
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,439
them what we've seemed to have all

255
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:52,769
learned is that they are right to be

256
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,139
against cannabis operators as they know

257
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:57,509
it what the issue seems to be is that

258
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:59,909
they are against an illicit unregulated

259
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:01,350
market so we're crazy things happen

260
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:03,809
where there is no way for people to

261
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,430
enforce properly so and so forth and on

262
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,318
that line I think everyone sees on the

263
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:08,519
the same page for that one because it's

264
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:10,500
like no one wants that unregulated

265
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,060
markets when we have the discussion

266
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,789
about what a regular market can do how

267
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:17,518
it can benefit from taxes - Safety's who

268
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:18,919
so on and so forth job opportunities it

269
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,078
seems to start opening up a discussion

270
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,729
but the county has not been promoting

271
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:24,838
those other aspects on them you know

272
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,980
they have not been or should say been

273
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,569
promoting because I know it's not their

274
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,069
job necessary on that but it's they have

275
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:31,049
not been educating on the totality of

276
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,360
what cannabis and you know regulations

277
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:34,679
could be one or another for that but

278
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,639
supervisors bargain like I said when it

279
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,219
comes to the candidate to the

280
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,419
cultivation side now they're not against

281
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,800
it because they're getting prospectors

282
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,269
are getting people saying hey this is a

283
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,219
great area we want to be able to do our

284
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:45,810
stuff here of course the laws don't

285
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,278
support it just yet but they're hearing

286
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:48,838
consolation what can be saying this is a

287
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,088
you know you guys have the resources for

288
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,470
this we want to do this here and the

289
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,000
contrast is is like they want to hear

290
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,939
more from these Town Council's

291
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,620
themselves on what their thoughts are we

292
00:09:56,938 --> 00:09:59,730
like that so long as the Town Council's

293
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,129
have an opportunity to be fully educated

294
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,659
on what the impact is on that and that's

295
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:05,458
where we are now trying to reach out

296
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,500
their Town Council's and see if we can

297
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,909
have that discussion or reach out to the

298
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,929
residents of those Town Council's and

299
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,419
see if they can start that discussion

300
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:13,708
themselves and see if they can start

301
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:15,809
understanding a little bit better what

302
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:18,659
you know the benefits one right now that

303
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:21,119
could be for them so just keeping on the

304
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:24,088
same point of outdoor cultivation you're

305
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,480
saying the Board of Supervisors while

306
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,889
initially say

307
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:32,139
nor in door is open to the idea of

308
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:34,959
greenhouse or outdoor but wants to hear

309
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:39,070
from the town councils that they wanted

310
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:41,649
in their local towns or agricultural

311
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,300
areas absolutely absolutely and so I

312
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,730
mean ultimately these are our elected

313
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:46,958
officials they should be doing what we

314
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,850
are asking them to do

315
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,979
if the Town Council's are telling you

316
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,480
and no we don't want this then they'll

317
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,709
likely listen but if they're saying hey

318
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,449
there's something here and we should be

319
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,278
exploring this that'll be a different

320
00:10:55,448 --> 00:11:00,309
story for them to start seeing that the

321
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,570
the initial thoughts because it was you

322
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:04,359
know a year ago when they first passed

323
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,379
the motion to start looking to stuff the

324
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,820
initial thought was like let's just

325
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:08,198
limit this we won't have a very broad

326
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,940
discussion either I just take some baby

327
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:11,828
steps so the easiest baby step was to

328
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,029
say let's take the agricultural land out

329
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:14,679
of the equation because that is just

330
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:17,559
such a massive part of what LA County

331
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,989
has but now as we've learned we've seen

332
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,328
more data and more people's opinions on

333
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,220
the matter the interest is seriously

334
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:25,569
there now how do we bridge that gap and

335
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,230
how do we give ourselves the opportunity

336
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,310
and how does the county also see

337
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,389
revenues coming from that that could

338
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:33,789
easily go to other counties surrounding

339
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:35,818
counties instead that makes no sense for

340
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:38,139
that opportunity to go elsewhere on that

341
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:39,399
one thing I did like that there was a

342
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:41,440
recommendation that one of the

343
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,730
supervisors gave us and we put it

344
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,880
ultimately within the committee is that

345
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,620
we asked the the supervisors to do a

346
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,818
study I would say essentially how much

347
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,589
money are they're going to spend on

348
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:52,539
trying to enforce against all the

349
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,399
agricultural land although the operators

350
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:55,689
that are on there versus how much money

351
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,948
could they bring in in revenue if they

352
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,139
actually regulated allowed it to happen

353
00:11:56,948 --> 00:12:00,429
so I'm hopeful that that study that they

354
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:01,778
will do at some point and they can

355
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,129
really contrast those numbers and see

356
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:04,838
where more benefits can come from that

357
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:06,939
are there tabs that are starting to

358
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,329
speak up to say hey we do kind of want

359
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,540
to explore outdoor cultivation in our

360
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:15,429
town or the environs of our

361
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:16,929
well yeah absolutely you know we had we

362
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:18,969
had a couple and come to mind right now

363
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:20,319
one of them was we reached out to

364
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,230
recently to have the discussion of the

365
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,600
Town Council we were prepared to go in

366
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,039
there with as much facts that we would

367
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,550
think supports why it would be good to

368
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:32,230
have a regulate market versus not and it

369
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,459
was a town council for Little Rock and

370
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,889
pear blossom so they're out in the

371
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,780
Antelope Valley area and typically that

372
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,069
area out there is very conservative we

373
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:40,990
thought that they would not be very

374
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,150
receptive to it turns out the entire

375
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,649
council was very receptive and they were

376
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:46,629
concerned that look what the currents

377
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,519
caps were on there and how that could

378
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:50,379
affect their town they were great to

379
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,850
point out that the area's the land had

380
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:53,559
no the infrastructure on there so they

381
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,240
were a lot more knowledgeable than we

382
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:56,739
were even prepared to see him there the

383
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,029
voting data seemed to support it on that

384
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,490
as well too so we knew that ahead of

385
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:02,500
time so they did vote about 54% in favor

386
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,960
of prop 64 so we knew we had that in

387
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,509
there other communities so that's this

388
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,340
or five other do communities such as out

389
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:11,169
in the Santa Monica Malibu mountains

390
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,600
area out there you have Topanga Canyon

391
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:17,019
and Topanga Canyon is an unincorporated

392
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,000
area very well known I think within the

393
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:21,069
cannabis space itself as well to

394
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,840
everyone kind of hasn't understood that

395
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,310
there are growers there people grow for

396
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,690
their own personal use or otherwise it's

397
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,599
been historically done there that's a

398
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,610
great location for all that what's been

399
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,990
surprising to us in a very positive way

400
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,700
is that that community when you look at

401
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,759
that voting data the community was

402
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,620
actually at 76% in favor of prop 64

403
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:40,569
passing so by far they were one of the

404
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,549
larger you know highest-rated you know

405
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:45,040
commutes that in favor of legal cannabis

406
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:47,439
there however the way the current zoning

407
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,500
is set up their supervisor who

408
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,210
represents them supervisor Sheila Kuehl

409
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,340
who is very favorable to topics she has

410
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,830
always been favorable she she wants to

411
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,410
see a regulated market however she has

412
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,570
not had a very loud voice in this

413
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:03,819
discussion because the zoning has made

414
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,160
so her district essentially would only

415
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,720
have the ability to have only one

416
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,589
dispensary in the entire district for

417
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,410
her

418
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,759
and no cultivation and no cultivation

419
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:14,709
would be hard to find anything else on

420
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,240
there so the entire Topanga Canyon area

421
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,410
all that stuff in there there is no

422
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,090
zoning that is allowed for any

423
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:22,089
commercial cannabis use indoor outdoor

424
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:24,250
you name it so this is an example where

425
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,960
the Town Council's started getting in

426
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,029
the year of the County Board of

427
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,090
Supervisors saying hey we would like

428
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:34,779
either indoor outdoor cultivation in the

429
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,759
Topanga area that maybe the Board of

430
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,370
Supervisors would start to listen to

431
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,100
them and change light like that it seems

432
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:46,120
like the current policy is all cannabis

433
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,730
cultivation in this little tiny needle

434
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,200
pin sized area of the entire county

435
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,810
that's where it's all going to happen

436
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,490
and what we need is people in different

437
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:57,339
areas saying hey we'd like it in our

438
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:00,190
area too and by the way we also like to

439
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,480
do greenhouse or outdoor yeah and I mean

440
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,370
it's really important because they've

441
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,920
that if that town council could vote the

442
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:08,049
voice that opinion more strongly to

443
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,449
supervisor Kuehl she would be even more

444
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:12,389
encouraged to supports you know

445
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,500
expanding and actually having a viable

446
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:15,759
cannabis market I think right now what

447
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,830
they have proposed is not a viable

448
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,909
market it'll be a market where you'll

449
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,590
have people that'll spend their money

450
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:21,669
and pay their taxes and also been there

451
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,500
but they have to be competing against

452
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:25,179
the illicit operators and the illicit

453
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
guys want to be responsible they'll be

454
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:28,899
just possibly going to jail for

455
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,690
something that is innate if you're

456
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:33,579
leaving but there's also the contrast to

457
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,830
where you have certain Town Council's

458
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,000
that have people that sit on them that

459
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,320
are conservative have based their

460
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,519
opinion and they voice that opinion but

461
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,980
it doesn't reflect what the actual

462
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,829
voting data is for the area so if the

463
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,120
panga canyons Town Council has decided

464
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,190
that they've had this discussion

465
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,350
previously last year when we went out to

466
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,760
do a opportunity to speak with them they

467
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,379
spoke about it for you know about an

468
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,610
hour on the thing and since that time

469
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:56,019
they backed away and said great there's

470
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,120
not gonna be anything happening here I

471
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:59,120
don't see that that is reflecting the

472
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,129
will of what the resident

473
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,149
are there and the residents are the ones

474
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,320
that need to show them but it's just

475
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,610
something they want they need to go to

476
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,350
their town council and they need to talk

477
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,570
to them and say we voted for this thing

478
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,379
if we don't do this there are parents

479
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,550
that could be separate from their

480
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:12,230
children there could be so many other

481
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:14,569
consequences on this stuff if they are

482
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,830
continuing to do their grows because the

483
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,830
law is no longer support them to do that

484
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:31,259
