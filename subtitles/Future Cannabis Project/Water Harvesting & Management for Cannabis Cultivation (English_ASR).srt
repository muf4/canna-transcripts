1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,950
because becoming big we're really

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,609
starting to talk about our waterways and

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,490
and and the way that we're what water

4
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:17,160
runoff is happening now if it's a crop

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,640
that can save the earth what's what's

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,539
going on and and how can we save our

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:29,698
waterways specifically Layton how what's

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:32,219
a big solution in this talking about is

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,100
very simple to do on a large scale it's

10
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,410
that crop residue I wanted to talk about

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,870
water harvesting I know you guys all

12
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:42,148
know about a sister and connected to

13
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,369
your gutters right it's easy to collect

14
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,829
water when it's raining but how do you

15
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:49,649
get water on a large scale when it's the

16
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,058
middle of summer it's not that

17
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,939
complicated

18
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:57,238
driving in here I saw a few up upland

19
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,459
bogs okay so it's just basically a pit

20
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,640
where there's a bunch of moisture that's

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,790
collected and so instead of connecting

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,549
your gutter from the cistern and then

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,439
dumping it will create a bog and what

24
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,439
that bog does is it holds water long

25
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:17,250
term what's in the well you can go Hugo

26
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:20,129
put in log sticks chips and that will

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,049
hold the water long-term and prevent it

28
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:24,629
from migrating the key to water

29
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,640
harvesting is slowing it down we all

30
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:28,289
know what erosion is an erosion has to

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,000
be avoided it's strictly in the organic

32
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,850
matter its stripping the soil that

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,489
you're you're trying to hold on to so if

34
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:38,419
you can slow water down you can prevent

35
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:41,789
erosion you all know what's whales are

36
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:44,070
what's a BIOS well fill it with logs

37
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,799
fill it with chips cover it with dirt

38
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:48,379
and plant it now that's gonna hold water

39
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,049
long term it's not going to evaporate

40
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:53,789
the roots from the plants on top will

41
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,340
prevent that hundred year storm from

42
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,590
washing it away which is again erosion

43
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,540
we've got to prevent that so that when

44
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,380
you're looking at water movement across

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,689
your soils those roots are critical

46
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:09,989
let's go a little deeper cover crops

47
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:12,489
love them what do they do well they

48
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:14,830
build tilth they help put or gain

49
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,650
matter back into the soil they put

50
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,170
carbon which feeds the microbiome the

51
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,890
biology so all of these wonderful things

52
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:26,679
are happening and guess what that water

53
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:28,599
can now infiltrate instead of just

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,270
running across the top because of that

55
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,519
never having soil bear always having

56
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,100
roots to hold it together and to

57
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,909
continuously build organic matter which

58
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:41,979
guess what stores moisture so let's take

59
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:44,439
it a little deeper groundwater we all

60
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:46,829
know what groundwater is in the old days

61
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:49,240
we all dig what we all dug wells and

62
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,490
those wells we use to feed our animals

63
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,950
or water our animals and sometimes for

64
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,439
our own drinking water what does the

65
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:59,829
well do well it actually gives the water

66
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:02,169
a place to go so it does two things it

67
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,300
allows you to see how well you're doing

68
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:06,639
no pun intended as far as building

69
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,740
groundwater up around your property and

70
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,629
during the summer you'll see that there

71
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,180
actually is water there where's it

72
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:15,340
coming from your bio swales the upland

73
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,980
bogs which are slowly releasing that

74
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,569
water back into the ground another thing

75
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:21,759
it does is if you pull water out of

76
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,219
there it helps to wick the water back

77
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,469
into that well so it's an emergency

78
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:27,969
situation you've got a drought going on

79
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:30,069
and you need to water your plants the

80
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,229
more you pull out of there the more

81
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:35,349
it'll come in so you're really giving

82
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:37,959
yourself a lot of options to allowing

83
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:40,689
yourself to harvest water slowly from

84
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,490
the soil in order to water whatever you

85
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:45,669
need and this can be done a large scale

86
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,469
or small scale do I love ponds I do I

87
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:49,000
hate the restrictions the reason I'm

88
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:51,250
even talking about this is because of

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,919
Wendy two years ago she told me what the

90
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,650
state of California did to her in trying

91
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,839
to get a pond in and I was horrified to

92
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,960
hear that she's not allowed to have fish

93
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,400
in him she has to have a bowl fraud

94
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,650
mitigation plan

95
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,379
no both frogs in the pond or we're going

96
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,719
to come and pump it out this is insane

97
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:12,490
how do you stop nature well who are

98
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,729
these people that are deciding that they

99
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:18,250
should control nature so instead of

100
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:20,949
building a pond for all that expense get

101
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,620
smart build bogs build swamp build

102
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:24,909
swales again bioswales and and store

103
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,829
that water slow

104
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,340
down so that in the summer you have it

105
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:29,339
when you need it
