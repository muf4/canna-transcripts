[Music]

2
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:19,800
do any of you have any questions high

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:22,038
THC is not except for pain isn't really

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,439
needed and I'd like to have you guys

5
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:28,240
comment on what do you see in terms of

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,679
the CBN CBG

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,839
thca the whole whole most of things

8
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:35,000
which we know have medical value I

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,399
didn't hear you talk much about that and

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,439
I would like to have you know the Swami

11
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,759
is talking about spiritual and

12
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,039
recreational uh Mr Raider is talking

13
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,399
about medical and I think those are two

14
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,719
somewhat different things I'd like to

15
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,079
hear what you have to great I mean I'll

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,679
jump right into it I mean I think that

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,759
the the one of the things we are going

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,719
to see with with uh with regulation is

19
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:57,119
um increased availability of some of the

20
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,679
canab noids we currently don't have

21
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,320
access to um there's a huge CBD bubble

22
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,359
in world right now there's I I've been

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,079
told there's as much as 50,000 kilos of

24
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,799
CBD basically sitting around the world

25
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,039
right now going nowhere just because

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,280
everybody decided oh we're going to be

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,320
in the CBD business um but what I want

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,200
to see is I want to see thcv I want to

29
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,359
see cbdv I want to see um I want to see

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,920
some of these really weird breakdown

31
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,438
products I mean there are only really

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,359
everybody always says there's 120 canabo

33
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:25,679
no there aren't there are four canabo

34
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,599
okay and then there are are their

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
breakdown products okay and there are

36
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,839
their propyl variants and that's it all

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,920
right and but some of these breakdown

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,280
products these are metabolites and they

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,719
have different effects and we've only

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,680
started to explore them and so I think

41
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,000
that exploring from a medicinal

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,079
standpoint the incredible utility of

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,599
this plant um is amazing and I I think

44
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:48,718
we're going to be doing it for decades

45
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:51,199
which is really cool one of the coolest

46
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,718
Parts about legalization and and in in

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,880
and recreational marijuana or

48
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:58,280
recreational marijuana becom illegal is

49
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,879
or cannabis s is um is is that the the

50
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,920
the medical side of things can

51
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,438
concentrate on on on what's best for

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,879
them the the recreational side of things

53
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:06,798
can concentrate on what's best for them

54
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,919
but there's somewhere in the middle

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,039
that's your maybe neutral you know take

56
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,839
your daily cannabis supplement for for

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,639
for General Health maybe I don't have a

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,840
specific Wellness Wellness exactly and

59
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:19,559
so so I I I don't necessarily see them

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,080
as having to be completely different

61
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,199
things I think there's it's a spectrum I

62
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,800
think it's more of a bell curve than

63
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,439
necessarily a black and white issue U my

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,319
question is um about testing Josh you

65
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:33,318
mentioned that thank you you mentioned

66
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,878
that uh somebody asked you to retest it

67
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:36,878
again

68
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:40,799
that is the problem that I have with

69
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,840
testing Labs because um I'm new I

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,640
understand that I'm in the edible

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,840
business and I want to be exact by my

72
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,878
standards and my standards are very

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,360
severe And yet when you when I test it

74
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:54,158
it comes back how could that be and they

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,720
test it again and okay now it's accurate

76
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:57,560
and they just send it back to you to

77
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,000
retest it again and you retested it and

78
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,239
found out in their favor so how can

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,120
anybody me um feel comfortable and

80
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,439
secure in paying for a testing lab and

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,239
it's not accurate okay well so there's a

82
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,519
lot of issues with that and and with

83
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,799
Edibles it gets to be this whole whole

84
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,640
kind of conflated issue so so first of

85
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,239
all with Edibles um I I have this

86
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,919
presentation I do about stratified

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,120
sampling and and in in testing multiple

88
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,759
samples through through a production run

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,280
and and having some sort of idea of the

90
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,878
variance so so it's it's it's a number

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
of things first Edibles are extremely

92
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,798
hard to test to bring to bring a sample

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,280
into a Testing Lab that sees a cookie a

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,840
gummy bear a piece of beef jerky um and

95
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,239
all these things as you know as Edibles

96
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,759
they're all completely different tests

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,759
and really need their

98
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,519
own validated test for each one of those

99
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,280
types of samples um because you're

100
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,920
testing in completely different products

101
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,759
when I test a gummy bear versus a

102
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,039
brownie it's a completely different

103
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,798
extraction process a completely

104
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,759
different test so the testing lab needs

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,599
to have different procedures for the

106
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,878
different types of Ed

107
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,839
and and I think again we're really glad

108
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,359
to see people with with budgets get into

109
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,959
this because a lot of your edible

110
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,840
producers don't want to spend the money

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,519
they really should be spending to make a

112
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,000
proper product um you know if if if if I

113
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,000
was producing say omega-3 infused

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,358
gummies each production run I'd be doing

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,600
dozens of tests throughout that

116
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,120
production run now do I do do I run hot

117
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,840
at the very beginning of the run and

118
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,280
then then it then about you know 10

119
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,359
units in all of a sudden it starts to

120
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,519
level off and I get homogeneity there's

121
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
also the issue with Edibles is is one

122
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,719
side of the cookie completely different

123
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,038
than the other side of the cookie how

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,800
many chocolate chips did you put in the

125
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:39,279
cookie are the chocolate chips infused

126
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,879
and so I think what we get is we get

127
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,439
edible makers that bring in one cookie

128
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,600
from one batch and then the next B and

129
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,199
these are these are the ones that that

130
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,879
are doing a lot of testing and then the

131
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,360
next batch they bring in one cookie and

132
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,319
they're like well last batch it was you

133
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,960
know 30% higher what what's going on

134
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:55,000
here it's like well the next cookie off

135
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,239
the line would have been 50% higher do

136
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,720
you know that you know do you have an

137
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,639
idea of what your production process is

138
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,479
doing and then so I could go on and on

139
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,199
about all the problems with with edible

140
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,079
standardization let me jump into one

141
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,960
thing on that which is the idea is that

142
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,038
in every other industry a wine maker

143
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:15,000
doesn't go down always to the wine

144
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:17,240
Testing Lab the wine maker has a lab

145
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,720
yeah okay and I think that what you're

146
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,160
going to see is is that you're going to

147
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,800
see a lot more companies take this in

148
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,800
and then go to somebody who's expert and

149
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,280
say test my testing all right and then I

150
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,759
think it's going to become a lot more

151
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,559
prevalent I and when you when you hear

152
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,479
yeah when you hear a retest I mean

153
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
that's most often because they didn't

154
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,359
believe the value it wasn't because the

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,478
lab's trying to give them what they want

156
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,919
to hear it's a very important

157
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:47,879
distinction you know um yeah and I mean

158
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:50,279
flower testing can be hugely variable so

159
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,560
the top of the plant can be twice as

160
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,799
much as the bottom so how do I

161
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,759
homogenize my entire batch so that I can

162
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,038
get a good accurate value across the

163
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,120
entire picture that's really the goal of

164
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,719
testing and we'll see this whole

165
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,879
standardization effort be forced upon us

166
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,240
with regulations so you're going to be

167
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,759
required to do statistically valid

168
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,079
testing not just one sample not just a

169
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,879
sample but across your batch and make

170
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,439
sure that that distributor actually

171
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,159
really knows what's on the label of

172
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,680
their product and and also when when

173
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,880
when you look at the when you look at

174
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,000
the composition of let's say alcoholic

175
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,759
beverages okay like wine you don't go in

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,240
and pick up a bottle of wine and go oh I

177
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:34,120
wonder what the of terpinolene is in

178
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,598
this Cabernet all right the reason is is

179
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,759
that you're buying the wine you're

180
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:39,519
buying the kind of totality the gestal

181
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,960
of it and right now I think we're

182
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:45,120
getting a little too granular sometimes

183
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:49,198
in our look at this product all right it

184
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,160
may not be as easily sliced and diced as

185
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,360
everybody wants it we just need to have

186
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,520
a well-characterized safe pure

187
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,319
product um my question was kind of you

188
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,639
know a little obscure on

189
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,720
um you know kind of the future of pot

190
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,800
but how much you know in the past and

191
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,400
the traditions of the past have have had

192
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,360
some type of possibly biological

193
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:15,318
relevant or psych you know

194
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,479
pharmacologically relevant uh benefits

195
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:21,240
the thing that's coming to mind is have

196
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:24,279
if if any of you have um ever tried like

197
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,120
the Malawi cobs and my questions kind of

198
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,159
to you know what could have happened

199
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,360
there to where you know you take a fresh

200
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,639
Cola and you wrap it in a certain type

201
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,160
of leaf you bury it in the ground and

202
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,720
there's this decomposing process and so

203
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm wondering what kind of degradative

204
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,319
Tarpin unique kind of you know

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,079
degradated cannaboids come about CU it's

206
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,560
like this whole legend of you know

207
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,758
process and is there anything Rel to

208
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,839
that what's the hive from

209
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,080
apoxin I mean honestly because I

210
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,679
remember I remember there was a whole

211
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:56,439
phase in Mendo you'll remember this

212
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,639
Swami there was a whole phase for a

213
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,639
while where people were burying their

214
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,759
weed and and you know pulling out the

215
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,158
ground and saying man this mold gets you

216
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,000
what's really interesting all the guys

217
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:07,839
who are like promoting that died

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,879
relatively

219
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:14,439
young it's like oh yeah Fred he checked

220
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,158
out at about 47 you know but I I think

221
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,360
that there are indigenous techniques

222
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:22,360
that we're we're going to learn from and

223
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,280
I think that I mean I I think Malawi is

224
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,120
a great place where there's a whole

225
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,279
tradition of these gold lighter strains

226
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,038
in Colombia um the Colombian Golds were

227
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,319
often created

228
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:35,080
by breaking the primary stem on the

229
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,399
plant and bleaching it out right before

230
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,038
it was finally

231
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,440
harvested stressing the plant well

232
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,120
there's a whole tradition of stressing

233
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,399
the plant in many ways some people used

234
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,080
to drive a a spike right through the

235
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,879
base of of the of the Stu and so on I

236
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,200
just want to put a shout out for Panama

237
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,639
Red anybody remember Panama Red

238
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,080
psychedelic man

239
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,120
absolutely so high high carry offing

240
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,759
strain okay strains that smell like

241
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,879
pepper like can like are basically High

242
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,039
bet carry offing strains and and what's

243
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:08,159
funny is the closest thing out there are

244
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,078
some of the C cookies variants now that

245
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,199
are super super high in carry offing and

246
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:15,479
relatively low in miring so I want some

247
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,360
opinion I have a question here that um

248
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,399
I've been listening to some of the

249
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,278
panels over the last few days and I've

250
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,879
heard a lot of lawyers speak tell us

251
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,200
about how you can't patent strains and

252
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,000
you're not going to be able to do these

253
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,680
things but I didn't hear anybody talk

254
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,360
about the future of um a breeder such as

255
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:35,199
ourselves are going to go into the

256
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,240
future and other than the old term

257
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,959
hoarding strains um I'd like to know if

258
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,680
anybody up here can give us any

259
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:46,399
practical advice on um how we're going

260
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,599
to go into the future uh creating this

261
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,519
intellectual property and identifying it

262
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,959
and owning it well oops wrong one again

263
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,519
all right speaking with uh I think

264
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,119
Andrea Brooks yesterday I'm one of the

265
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,959
panelists I spoke to her afterwards

266
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,560
about uh you know the idea of patenting

267
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,278
uh these different strains that or

268
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:10,278
cultivars I should say that you that you

269
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:11,958
people were getting just from Crossing

270
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:16,000
you know endlessly Crossing these

271
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:18,639
hybrids and you even if you come up with

272
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,559
something unique uh once you put it out

273
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,039
in the public domain you sell clones of

274
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,439
it or you sell seeds of it or whatever

275
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,879
it's gone in terms of your patent right

276
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,839
you have to patent it first before it is

277
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:32,958
ever commercialized uh but I think that

278
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,120
really the patents besides that the

279
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,919
patents that will really make a big

280
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,759
difference are the ones that dise that

281
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:46,240
uh uh are about Disease Control about uh

282
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,679
having resistance to btis and and PM and

283
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,680
that sort of thing and I think that

284
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,638
somebody who finds those genes and

285
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,479
incorporates them into strains that's

286
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,879
really going to be something so I can I

287
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
address a little bit this so plant

288
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,919
variety rights okay that's one kind of

289
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,680
plant patent all right and that is a

290
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:03,199
that's a clone okay it's not seed and

291
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,039
you can't prevent somebody from breeding

292
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,519
with your plant which is great that

293
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,799
means Innovation so you can have your

294
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,759
version of Strawberry Cough okay and if

295
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,879
there's no prior art out there that that

296
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,759
precludes that or nobody can say he's

297
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,958
actually growing my plant if you can

298
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,240
prove it to the satisfaction of the

299
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,479
patent office that you're novel and and

300
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,639
meet all the requirements for that

301
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,000
particular kind of plant as long as it's

302
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,240
clonally propagated or probably tissue

303
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,360
propagated you're cool seed you're not

304
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,720
cool at all okay and a deposit actually

305
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,839
has to be that plant okay now a utility

306
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,680
PL patent which I got okay a Utility

307
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:43,839
Patent on cannabis is is that you have a

308
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:46,679
class that is novel okay we bred a group

309
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,920
of cannabis plants and man I'll tell you

310
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,359
the patent office because we were the

311
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,958
first application they are really trying

312
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,320
to bust us they they were sending us

313
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,919
results from analytical 360 and

314
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,839
Washington about a CBD crew variety from

315
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:04,120
the south south of Spain and and I had

316
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,800
to drive all over the West Coast getting

317
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,639
samples of these varieties and test them

318
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,919
with a validated method and submit him

319
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,159
to the patent office for every rejection

320
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:14,719
letter we got and that went on for

321
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:18,480
months and months and months until

322
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,120
finally they said okay you win here's

323
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,639
the patent and we have a patent on a

324
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:27,399
very narrow range of type twos CBD and

325
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:29,839
together that don't produce Mir scene

326
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:33,679
okay and that's the key this is that CU

327
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,000
finding High miren plants with CBD in

328
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,838
them that's super easy finding CBD

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,679
plants that don't have mine in them

330
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,279
that's really hard and that's what we

331
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,519
did we spent three years breeding it so

332
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:46,799
two more question you can get a patter

333
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:50,440
two kinds thanks everybody said that

334
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,719
here is cannabis medical cannabis here

335
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,079
is medicine here's the FDA here's all

336
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,000
this stuff and no one talked about

337
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:59,679
integrating all that stuff the problem

338
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,679
with medicine and as far as I'm

339
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:05,838
concerned and I've been in it for my

340
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:09,000
entire life is that we have so siloed

341
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,880
every specialty every new thing that's

342
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,600
come along and the worst thing we want

343
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,320
is to be siloed as a

344
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,959
different

345
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,720
alternative

346
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,759
oppositional type of therapy and the

347
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,759
real success is going to be if we follow

348
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:30,240
the biopsychosocial model all chronic

349
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:34,360
disease involves all those aspects and

350
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,198
what kind of combination of specific can

351
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,320
cannabinoids specific cannaboid plants

352
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:42,838
with other types of traditional and

353
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,040
Medical Treatments is going to really

354
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,079
help that particular patient in front of

355
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:51,759
you and all the rest I think is just

356
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:55,879
going to drive a wedge in us that the

357
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:59,199
that the AMA and FDA and farmer just are

358
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:01,559
very happy to see happen

359
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:04,078
can talk to that um our last question I

360
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,638
just met Dave at lunch the other day we

361
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,000
had a wonderful little conversation so I

362
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,159
thank you for that question because uh I

363
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,320
actually uh I don't think there's a

364
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,879
difference between uh what's called

365
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,759
recreational and medicinal use I really

366
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,039
don't think that's the case at all and

367
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,199
there are people say well I want to just

368
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,639
have fun well how many medicines are out

369
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,758
there for mood alteration right how many

370
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,759
medicines are out there with

371
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,720
unbelievable side effects right so I

372
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,480
think that the spiritual as aspect of

373
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,720
cannabis is essentially why it heals and

374
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,320
all the different specific ways that it

375
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,680
heals we're going to have Jeff and

376
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,920
various people pinpoint that for us when

377
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,638
you need it for that but I think it's

378
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,479
they did test with CBD you know about

379
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,079
the see they repress CBD and these

380
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,440
people got suicidal when they had a a

381
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:55,078
drug that rep we have CBD we need CBD as

382
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,240
our basic health Wellness in our body so

383
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,559
I don't think there's really a

384
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,759
difference we use this this cannabis to

385
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,599
alter our Consciousness and to elevate

386
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,639
us and that's part of the healing

387
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,320
process and yeah I find it a false

388
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,278
dichotomy and I also think that we we do

389
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,160
want to have we do want all the Muggles

390
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:14,639
to be here we want it to be mainstream

391
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,919
because it's really an essential part of

392
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,278
of of really coming

393
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,019
alive that's good that's good great

394
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:25,360
thank

395
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:28,679
[Applause]

396
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,480
you I write books on efficient cannabis

397
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,359
youth

398
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,159
and my specialty is lowd dose cannabis

399
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,879
unless you're a grower like Kyle kushman

400
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,879
or Swami these two are brothers from

401
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:43,120
another mother to

402
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:46,559
me smoking a joint is the least

403
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,879
efficient way to use cannabis for the

404
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,758
average user they're wasting their money

405
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,759
and the cannabis strains that are

406
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,720
available today one hit is enough to get

407
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,440
you completely high and then you put

408
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,240
your joint out and when you light it

409
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,040
again you just get a massive dose of

410
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,000
hydrocarbons any comments Swami Kyle

411
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:11,759
kushman the board this on well one of

412
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,600
the things that I think is is wrong uh

413
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,480
well I'll give you an example uh uh I

414
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,759
was on a team that was Consulting with a

415
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,879
group from uh uh Vegas uh who wanted to

416
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:26,360
build a a grow and and so forth and and

417
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:29,838
the investors were absolutely fascinated

418
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,639
by how strong uh the

419
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,759
uh the cultivars that we had and we had

420
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,079
to offer and at at a certain point I

421
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,318
said you know you're really looking at

422
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:43,599
this the wrong way I said most of your

423
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:45,958
people are not going to be uh Native uh

424
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,839
uh Las Vegas they're going to be you

425
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:50,159
know tourists coming in here and uh

426
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,000
they're going to get their their medical

427
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,198
thing here what they thought at the time

428
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,399
that that would happen and uh then go

429
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:57,000
and and they're going to buy something

430
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,720
so I said you're going to sell them

431
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,039
joints that have 20% th seeing them

432
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,800
they're going to have a bad experience

433
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,438
they're naive right they're going to

434
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,359
smoke that joint and they're going to

435
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,400
say oh I forgot how to breathe my heart

436
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,639
is explosing you know this sort of thing

437
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,839
they're going to end up in the emergency

438
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,400
Ward you know I said you don't want that

439
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:17,399
experience I said you could much more

440
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,360
easily just roll up uh fan uh leaves

441
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,400
from this stuff and and have have 5% THC

442
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,519
joined as their first experience I mean

443
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,360
we were smoking stuff back in the' 60s

444
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,558
and70s that was like 2 to 3% THC I mean

445
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,359
really and had a great time with it

446
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:38,200
exactly I mean so the idea of having

447
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:40,119
these massive amounts uh to me you know

448
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,120
I mean the the idea that you're wasting

449
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:43,719
this the the point is this stuff is not

450
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:47,079
going to be that expensive and

451
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,038
especially if you're growing it yourself

452
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:50,720
I mean I throw away when I'm finished

453
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,519
with that joint probably what most

454
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,240
people start their joints with you know

455
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,960
it's just yeah let me let me let me jump

456
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,919
in so one thing that we didn't talk

457
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,360
about in The Evolution of cannabis is

458
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,640
the evolution of dose okay and that's a

459
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,798
whole another panel and I hope we have

460
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,640
it someday because the future of this is

461
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,599
understanding that a lot of the

462
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,720
constituents of cannabis um exhibit

463
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,119
basic dose in other words it does one

464
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,640
thing at one dose and one thing and

465
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,759
another and there's this whole

466
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,559
interesting concept and there's a bunch

467
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:22,519
of really cool papers by GW guy found in

468
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,798
GW

469
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:27,519
Pharmaceuticals um about

470
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:29,798
hormesis and hormesis is this idea of a

471
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,158
very very very small

472
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:35,319
actually causing a profound change in an

473
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,320
organism and it's it has it works on

474
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:40,000
scientific levels it works on spiritual

475
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,759
levels it's it's a fascinating

476
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,759
fascinating topic and there's a

477
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,480
scientist in Israel who's been doing

478
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,519
research on showing that your first dose

479
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,480
of THC is

480
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:56,798
neurotoxic and it works almost like an

481
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:00,440
inoculant like a vaccine all right to

482
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:02,918
adjust how you will respond to a canab a

483
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,919
phyto canabo from that point forward

484
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,159
this guy's published like six or seven

485
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,520
really good papers and um and he's from

486
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,000
a really prestigious University in

487
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,000
Israel and what it is is that we don't

488
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,960
know and I'll tell you one thing that I

489
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,319
do know is we don't have a good

490
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,880
conception of cannabis dose today and

491
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,279
that part of the evolution of our

492
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,679
