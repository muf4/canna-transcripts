1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
sure this is someone that's really

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:08,039
special to us someone that we're really

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,359
inspired by uh doesn't get a lot of

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,619
light shined on him just because he's

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,839
way up there in Washington we don't know

6
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:14,820
where that is is that in Canada but

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,278
here's our good friend Kenny Right Here

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,560
Mount Baker Highway we love him the time

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,839
he's going to tell us about his farm and

10
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,939
his practices up there he grows

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,439
incredible herb we love we grow his

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,899
strains grows a little bit of our

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,518
strains we got mad love for you Kenny

14
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,259
give it up for Kenny Mount Baker Highway

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,739
though

16
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,160
[Music]

17
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,159
good

18
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:46,259
uh yeah I was like thinking about what

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,939
to talk to you guys about and uh

20
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,859
I think like we're all in the

21
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,959
regenerative farming and we're all

22
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,058
growing stuff so we all put stuff in

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,120
pots you know

24
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:59,939
and uh like soil like what are we using

25
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,698
for our potting soil medium I figured

26
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,439
that's a good I talked about today but

27
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,478
yeah I'm up in Washington I don't know

28
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,599
if you guys don't know me but I don't

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,900
know everybody here maybe

30
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,719
but I got a farm up in Washington and uh

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,140
yeah we have a wreck license and we uh

32
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,900
we do like outdoor mostly and like that

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,519
all on the ground

34
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,040
um

35
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,699
yeah we don't do any lights or anything

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,700
uh

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,478
it's all closed loop pretty much like we

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,459
don't

39
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,319
when we started we were buying potting

40
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,419
soil and

41
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,500
it was organic and we just needed

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,239
potting so in the beginning of the

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,459
season and then the next season the

44
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,420
market crashed or like at the end of

45
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,179
that year

46
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,719
we're like we had no money in spring or

47
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,340
in the next season so

48
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,319
we just kind of went on this like

49
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,899
journey of learning how to like

50
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,359
make our own soil on the farm

51
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,399
and uh

52
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,500
basically what I started doing was I

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,420
just I was doing compost and that was

54
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,379
like okay I'm making compost I got

55
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,719
manure

56
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,400
and I got like I was using mushroom

57
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,739
blocks spent mushroom blocks that would

58
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,620
collect at the local mushroom farm

59
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:19,140
and uh that was going on our beds it was

60
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,060
compost but like we had no money we're

61
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,039
like a struggling direct Farm it's like

62
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,939
me and my sister trying to make it

63
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,840
happen

64
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:26,840
and uh

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,400
so we just like started sifting our

66
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,679
compost with a half inch screen just

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,060
over like a wheelbarrow for a full wreck

68
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,879
farm and like

69
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,640
yeah we did That's That season we did I

70
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,159
think like 10 yards or something like it

71
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:47,639
was a good amount by hand over a

72
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:52,259
over a wheelbarrow um just a frame and

73
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:54,179
stapled up you know and so it worked and

74
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:55,859
we were a little late to the game you

75
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,719
know we learned that year you gotta you

76
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,599
gotta be a little bit ahead you can't

77
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:04,199
just like make your your soil in Spring

78
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,339
and be ready to go you know

79
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,139
um it was a little hot it actually

80
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,659
worked though I mean

81
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,359
it was surprising we had decent enough

82
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:15,299
success like you know we grew Fireweed

83
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,060
maybe it wasn't like Top Notch the

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,280
perfect soil that year but we we were

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,800
able to like have a great farm and like

86
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,680
you know pay

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,599
yeah four people like me and my sister

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,000
and two other employees the whole year

89
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,339
so pretty good I'd say

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,259
and uh

91
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,259
yeah so the next step was

92
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,739
I realize oh I need a lot more soil

93
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,139
because I want to be like sexy my plants

94
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,360
and pots that's like the the goal I want

95
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,439
to have that much soil but for my farm

96
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,019
like

97
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,299
you know I feel like I need to buy 25 to

98
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,299
50 yards of soil realistically to sex

99
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,519
all my plants and four gallon pots which

100
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,340
is minimal to me I'd like to go like

101
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,680
seven but you know so it'll spit

102
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,598
expensive so

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,219
um I like linked up with that that

104
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,259
mushroom farm locally they're like

105
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:10,560
they're certified organic it's really

106
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,840
clean it's just sawdust and um organic

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,900
like grains like whatever's like I think

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,060
it's holes some kind of green holes

109
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,180
and uh

110
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,519
so it's really clean input and it's like

111
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,699
super ground up already so

112
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,099
uh makes great compost and yeah we just

113
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,720
started taking our our cannabis chips we

114
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,979
chip up all the Cannabis at the end of

115
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,080
the year

116
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:37,019
and

117
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,719
you would clean out our

118
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,399
cow manure from the cow we have we

119
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,860
started with one cow

120
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,418
and like just like the next year got a

121
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,479
little better like

122
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,519
we've got a little bit ahead of the game

123
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:54,978
the soil was super fire and it was still

124
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:58,198
fresh it was like we had it done and

125
00:04:54,978 --> 00:05:00,899
I want to say we had it like sifted in

126
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,939
February or something

127
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,739
and yeah it's still a little fresh so

128
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:08,399
like

129
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,439
I'm at the point now where where uh yeah

130
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,239
right now I've been turning my my

131
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,879
compost pile

132
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,759
all summer for next year you know like I

133
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,219
already have like a 60-yard wind Road

134
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,199
just sitting in the field ready to go

135
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,660
and uh

136
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,060
you know I I do a thermophilic compost

137
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,439
so that means I'm heating it up and I'm

138
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,220
like

139
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,139
you know it's killing off whatever seeds

140
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,900
and bacteria or whatever I don't know

141
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,939
what to say you know I'm pretty late

142
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:41,519
intuitive about right how I'm doing it

143
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,800
all and you know you pile up a bunch of

144
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,139
stuff it just gets really hot

145
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,160
it's not that complicated

146
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,060
um

147
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,780
so yeah sorry I'm kind of rambling but

148
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,459
uh

149
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:58,579
anyways where was I

150
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:58,579
um

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,019
yeah thermophilic compost yeah I get it

152
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,500
going it gets hot I like turn it three

153
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:09,359
times now with my tractor and then

154
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,220
um on the third time I bring it into

155
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,680
like my covered area

156
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,800
and

157
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,259
uh it heats up one last time and after

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,660
that I sift it once it cools down like

159
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,939
below you know

160
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,000
100 degrees

161
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:29,819
I'll sift it and then

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,779
let it let that sit for another month or

163
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,160
two

164
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,859
so

165
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,240
and then I'm rocking it's like March and

166
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,879
getting going

167
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,379
so you gotta if you want to like do your

168
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,879
own soil it's

169
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,038
it's a bunch of work you gotta have a

170
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,019
lot of collection like that mushroom

171
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,079
farm I go every Monday and

172
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:51,240
I fill up like

173
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,639
four to six yards of mushroom box in my

174
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,038
truck by hand every single week

175
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,360
and then I unload them and I de-bag them

176
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,120
by hand

177
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,160
the fucking shitload of worse but like I

178
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,199
don't I don't pay for soil and actually

179
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,380
I make enough compost that I don't even

180
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,840
I don't pay for compost either anymore

181
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:12,060
and like

182
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,500
yeah the wrecking's hard like if you're

183
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,959
if you're trying to like set yourself

184
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,060
apart like you need to be have a niche

185
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,799
and like my Niche that I chose is that

186
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,780
you know we're gonna be regenerative and

187
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,418
do a closed loop system

188
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:26,219
and uh

189
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:27,839
I just feel like a lot of people don't

190
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,639
talk about like what they're actually

191
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,500
using for soil I don't really know who

192
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,120
most people are using fruit potting soil

193
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,959
you know it seems a little mysterious

194
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,000
and

195
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,439
it's not that hard I think like a lot of

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,959
people don't realize they could just

197
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,399
sift their compost and let it sit you

198
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,318
know and then

199
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,239
put that into your stuff like sift it

200
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,360
with a half inch screen and then sift it

201
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,800
on a quarter inch screen I'm pretty sure

202
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,598
that's the

203
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,400
but uh

204
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,620
I could be wrong with this

205
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,899
is like one size

206
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,180
yeah it's really not complicated like

207
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:02,638
and I run like 10 000 square feet every

208
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:06,538
year it's a good sized Farm

209
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:09,598
um me and like uh two other guys pretty

210
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:13,019
much farming it and

211
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,120
yeah we crash we actually ended up uh to

212
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,519
sift the soil we do like a 60 yard

213
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,300
windrow so we're not doing it over the

214
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,139
the

215
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,418
um wheelbarrow anymore thank you and uh

216
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,220
we made it what's called like a trommel

217
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:28,019
and you can find these like videos

218
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,879
online it's a little mysterious I'm

219
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,639
thinking about maybe like selling the

220
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,459
schematics for my trauma but it's

221
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,718
essentially like a rotating

222
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,819
screen

223
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,680
that's like on a slight tilt and there's

224
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,039
a frame around it and you just shovel

225
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:45,659
into it and it's like rotating and all

226
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,639
the solids are kind of like

227
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,919
you know shaking off whatever's on there

228
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,620
and it's falling down the screen below

229
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,778
and then it's falling the out the end of

230
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,240
it into the wheelbarrow all the solids

231
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:00,419
like whatever didn't fully compost

232
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,440
and it's like super super easy we just

233
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:03,599
like

234
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,420
work for a whole week you know you're

235
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,980
just shoveling into the thing and

236
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:11,579
I mean I guess it doesn't sound that

237
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,259
easy but okay two guys can do like 60

238
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,660
yards in a week I mean I think that's

239
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:18,059
pretty dope

240
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:20,100
yeah I'm not paying any like

241
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:24,239
I don't know not paying for like peat

242
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,240
moss peat moss is like yeah

243
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:28,919
it's from like peat bugs that are

244
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,319
ancient and they're they're not coming

245
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,299
back like it's a

246
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,940
it's a weird thing that we just like

247
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:38,039
take that out of the ground and

248
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,720
it's kind of importance for the Earth so

249
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,278
like every time you buy a bag of soil

250
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,839
it's like

251
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,838
it shouldn't really feel

252
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:49,080
because you're just like robbing it from

253
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,639
one place and it's and they just kill

254
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,920
all these microbes that are these

255
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,259
ancient microbes by cooking it up and

256
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,899
he's having

257
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,338
yeah anyways

258
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,500
um anybody got any questions about

259
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,459
making soil like making your own potting

260
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,019
soil with like nothing like anybody

261
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:10,559
what are you doing with your cow manure

262
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:12,959
how are you integrating that oh yes

263
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,458
yeah so

264
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,859
after we got linked up with that

265
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:19,559
mushroom farm and like I do that every

266
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,200
week I get the mushroom blocks

267
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,239
um that's a really low nitrogen Source

268
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,399
it's just mostly wood chips it's like

269
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,740
yeah which is sawdust really

270
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,139
and um

271
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,080
yeah so you need you need nitrogen cows

272
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:36,120
cows are good for me because I have uh

273
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,180
pastures and

274
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,179
um

275
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:43,739
ends our defense so like I was like all

276
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,620
right I'm doing some cows and I started

277
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,180
off with a bull and like one bowl gives

278
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,539
you a good amount of manure like a small

279
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:54,599
farm like one cow you just crash it like

280
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:57,000
a like a home home size you know and I'm

281
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,680
up to like five cows now

282
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,659
and like

283
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,939
I mean I didn't spend any money on them

284
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:06,360
either I just like Craigslist you know

285
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,220
free just like keep your eyes out

286
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,339
um your local farmer like Paige like

287
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,040
people are always in a bind like

288
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,839
you know like there's fires or whatever

289
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,578
you can like really save somebody's

290
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,500
animals and like

291
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:21,059
so I have all these like Gary rejects

292
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,059
because I'm up in Dairy country in

293
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:27,119
Washington and like they're not like

294
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:29,458
meat cows necessarily but

295
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,379
um they're great for manure and uh

296
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:34,559
they're super sweet you know cows have

297
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:37,620
good energy so it puts a little bit into

298
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:42,299
the weed you know yeah as it matters

299
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:46,620
um but I have a a barn out in one of my

300
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:48,479
fields and uh for the winter time

301
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,759
you know you gotta feed the cows and

302
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,800
like currently I'm not on like a super

303
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,600
intensive rotation

304
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,219
and like the goal is someday to be

305
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,139
rotating the cows through the pasture

306
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,320
like all year and not hang but

307
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,159
apparently we uh we hey the field in the

308
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,200
summer

309
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,899
and we we feed the cows hay in the

310
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,000
winter and kind of like restrict their

311
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:11,339
access to the rest of the fields

312
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,019
and um they're in this barn and I feed

313
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,079
them hay in the barn and they just like

314
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:17,700
you know they shit where they stand and

315
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,319
I just tossed all these hay bales and

316
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,000
they move it around and they basically

317
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,339
like cover it up every day and if you

318
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,860
throw like an extra bit of hay and

319
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,680
you're adding enough nitrogen to that

320
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,600
carbon mix with their manure that it

321
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,879
actually like becomes a radiant heat

322
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,560
floor it becomes like a compost pile in

323
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,078
place it's called like a deep litter

324
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,699
system with a deep bedding system and it

325
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,979
works super good the cows like don't

326
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,079
want to go out of the barn you know they

327
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,360
like just want to hang out and like

328
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:48,620
chill and it smells pretty nice it

329
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,620
smells kind of sweet usually

330
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,379
um once it gets going like right now

331
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,659
it's a little early for me because I

332
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:58,200
just started here and I'm like two weeks

333
00:12:54,659 --> 00:13:00,958
ago and you know by December it's like

334
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,120
toasty and I can look out there and I

335
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,000
like there's a little scene coming out

336
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,519
of there like Barn like it's like one

337
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,500
side's open on the barn

338
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,299
um and that's really nice because I can

339
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,039
just drive in and grab that manure in

340
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,019
this in the springtime

341
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,240
and pull it out with my tractor and

342
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:22,278
throw in the window

343
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,278
so that became my nitrogen source

344
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:28,138
and you know it's really badass soil now

345
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:31,138
that we're making like

346
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:34,079
this year I ended up

347
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:36,659
you know we do everything from seeds

348
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,519
I start stuffing like uh seed cells and

349
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:41,159
I move up to half gallons

350
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,259
and I just had a bunch of stuff in half

351
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,360
gallons for a long time because things

352
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:47,100
are piling up you know oh I gotta change

353
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,959
greenhouse plastic this week I didn't

354
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,360
know I needed to like

355
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,239
you know things sat in pots and like I

356
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,940
was just super amazed at like the the

357
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,399
plants in these half gallon pots just

358
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,500
stayed green and just kept going and

359
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,299
they like got like this tall they're

360
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,259
just green and they're healthy and happy

361
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:06,539
and

362
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:08,458
so it's really like

363
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:10,679
it's just not that complicated to make

364
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:13,559
your own soil and you can sign like

365
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:16,019
local sources most mushroom Farms like

366
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,518
pay people to take that stuff out of

367
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:20,220
there it's a lot of Labor especially

368
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,259
because they got to remove the bags

369
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,940
so like

370
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:26,278
if you're just trying to make your soil

371
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,260
for like you know your home Garden like

372
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:30,360
man just gonna get a load of mushroom

373
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:32,039
blocks and add it to your Pile in a long

374
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,959
way like

375
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,379
do it a couple times

376
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:39,479
um that's like a really cool resource

377
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:41,399
wood chips in general are super good I'd

378
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,339
say they just take a little longer like

379
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:47,339
just amplify that time but

380
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,199
maybe three or four times you know would

381
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,240
I say it takes like five months for me

382
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,479
to do my compost system like totally

383
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:58,079
from like I'm starting to turn it to

384
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,480
when I'm I'm using it

385
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,859
um and the collection process takes you

386
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,839
know however long it takes to collect

387
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,899
that pile

388
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,899
um

389
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,680
yeah but that's pretty it's pretty

390
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,079
simple you know all you need is some

391
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,819
nitrogen some carbon

392
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,979
you can make your own soil like you

393
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,620
don't need perlite

394
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,440
yeah I haven't used perlite in four

395
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,500
years five years like I'm just cruising

396
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,860
like I don't even think about it maybe

397
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,078
maybe if I was growing like in a pot it

398
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,139
would be a little more of a thing but

399
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,359
you know I'm going in the ground like

400
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,579
that's just a small portion of its

401
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,800
existence is in the pot so

402
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:43,019
but it's cool to make it on the farm and

403
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,620
it feels really rewarding to like just

404
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,820
not be a part of that system and

405
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,560
you know like I'm looking at the ground

406
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,959
here it's all

407
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,359
wood chips like just you could pile it

408
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:56,638
up and make potting soil like there's so

409
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,339
many struggling Farmers out there just

410
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,198
getting swindled into all these like

411
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:03,839
products and there's all this Charlotte

412
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,819
Henry and like

413
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,320
yeah

414
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,980
you can just make it all look what you

415
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,959
got

416
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,159
like to make your JMS

417
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,838
if you got the eighth

418
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:15,240
and you can make your potting soil like

419
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,820
you don't have to have

420
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,100
the fancy trauma you just need a

421
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,980
wheelbarrow and like it's super simple

422
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,519
especially for home gardens like

423
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:29,420
and it's it's the best I don't know

424
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,519
yeah anybody have any questions anymore

425
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:33,599
tell us about your chicken systems the

426
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,360
last couple of years your chicken

427
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,600
tractors and all that yeah yeah I do uh

428
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,759
chickens for myself and my family and my

429
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,360
my staff I just do like

430
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,539
like this year I did 120 birds and I do

431
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,940
I just do pastured chicken and you know

432
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:52,620
I have some thoughts on on it actually

433
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,959
uh

434
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,679
like raising chicken is just a grain

435
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:01,338
game you know like I haven't found a way

436
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:05,119
to get past

437
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:07,199
this uh Industrial

438
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,359
raising chicken like if you're trying to

439
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,160
raise meat birds like I don't know a lot

440
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,859
of people that

441
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,900
aren't on some kind of industrial grain

442
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,539
wagon so

443
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,720
yeah I love chicken I like raisin

444
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:24,539
chickens and like

445
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,039
in my long-term Vision I want to learn

446
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,438
how to raise the chickens off the

447
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,599
compost pile there's at points of the

448
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,380
compost pile when it turns into a worm

449
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,798
bin

450
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,900
and it's just like a billion worms and I

451
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,879
haven't exactly figured out like how to

452
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,440
time that up with when I have chickens

453
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,520
but

454
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,919
um the way I'm raising them now I

455
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,980
I do uh chicken tractors so I have like

456
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:53,400
a cage it's a it's a big box rectangular

457
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,679
box and like wake up in the morning grab

458
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,419
a bucket of water some grain and go out

459
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,559
and feed them all right move them

460
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,820
because they're hungry and they

461
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,918
literally come to me and they're like

462
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:04,379
looking at me I'm like come on chickens

463
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:09,000
yeah Pull It Forward

464
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:11,640
they come usually and then uh and like

465
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,240
give them the Grain and um it takes like

466
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,299
no time you know it takes me like

467
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,519
man if I'm in a rush it takes me

468
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:22,980
four minutes to fill up the bucket of

469
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,058
water grab the grain feed the chickens

470
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,140
and then like

471
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,139
it takes about

472
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,639
it's like eight to ten weeks usually I

473
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:36,419
think is what people most people do

474
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,160
that's what I I usually do like

475
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,900
this year I raised my chickens for 10

476
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,580
weeks it was like kind of like an indoor

477
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,019
weed club and that's kind of my issue

478
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,259
with it too like

479
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:47,279
from that perspective of the green game

480
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:49,440
and

481
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,480
uh we need to figure out how to like

482
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,160
remove ourselves from the grain with the

483
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,819
chicken because like the chickens can

484
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,620
live off of other stuff you know

485
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:01,139
um

486
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:04,819
but yeah reason for like

487
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,820
10 weeks and uh

488
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,000
they do a really good job on the field

489
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,759
like they're moving in a grid so you can

490
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,619
kind of look into the field and see like

491
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,660
six months later you can see like wow

492
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:18,418
like grass right in that grid is really

493
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,519
nice so so I got I have a couple now

494
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,100
like poop so I'll move around and it's

495
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,798
actually like they evenly fertilize

496
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,839
really nice patches of your yard and

497
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,798
it's it brings a lot of Health to the

498
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,619
past year

499
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,298
and that's probably like you know that's

500
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:35,399
the second most fulfilling thing after

501
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,779
like gravy you know like eating the

502
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,280
chicken

503
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:42,200
um it's just like damn it really

504
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,200
improves the land but

505
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:48,119
yeah I can't get past that idea that I'm

506
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:51,538
just like buying industrial grain too

507
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:53,519
to improve my land you know so I got I'm

508
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:54,960
buying like soy-free organic like the

509
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,298
best I can find

510
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,319
um for where I'm at but

511
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:00,960
um

512
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,899
I'm kind of scheming up uh

513
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,058
a worm chicken plan you know I think

514
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,280
it's easy it's like it's just a timing

515
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:11,038
thing really and having the pile at the

516
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:13,319
right time but

517
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,119
yeah raising your chickens are easy I

518
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:17,939
think everybody should like do it if you

519
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,819
if you can and you eat meat like

520
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:24,660
I think I raised my birds for 16 this

521
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:26,399
year a piece and um they're each

522
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,919
all right

523
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,900
like the smallest for about three pounds

524
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,620
pretty good size with the biggest for

525
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,840
like 5.8 pounds like Christmas chickens

526
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:40,139
and so there's there's always like a

527
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:41,099
gradient because there's a packing order

528
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,900
um

529
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:46,259
there's always huge chickens and there's

530
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,380
always like a really tiny runt on

531
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:48,379
um

532
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,038
but yeah that's pretty much it that's

533
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,079
what's up you can just rent the

534
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,599
harvesting equipment locally in most

535
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:00,240
areas there's like a Farm Service Agency

536
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:03,359
you can reach out to like

537
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:07,440
or a Conservation District is in my area

538
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:09,779
and it's like nothing it's like 30 bucks

539
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,820
and

540
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,859
and you got everything to harvest like

541
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:14,579
you know 200 chickens in a day or

542
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:16,319
something

543
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,879
you got enough hands you can do a lot of

544
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,619
chickens in a day with it so it's really

545
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,360
cost effective and you don't need to buy

546
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:22,259
it a year

547
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,240
um

548
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:26,220
I get my chickens from a local Hatchery

549
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,558
I'm super lucky like it's right down the

550
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,179
road for me pretty much

551
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,099
um

552
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,080
but like recently I've like kind of been

553
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:36,119
looking like there's a lot of really

554
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,918
interesting chickens you can buy like if

555
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:39,418
you want legs you can get like leg

556
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,280
chickens and

557
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:44,100
you want breasts chickens you can get

558
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:48,298
breast chickens and yeah what's your

559
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:51,480
average cost per pound uh 10.

560
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:54,599
I'm not uh off top of my head I couldn't

561
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,179
say it but I did 120 chickens at 16 a

562
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,699
bird this year I'm just not sure the

563
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,980
poundage so average at like three foot

564
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,140
three pounds yeah definitely three

565
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,740
pounds yeah three and a half three three

566
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:11,520
and a half yeah

567
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:15,720
16 bird so like five bucks a pound

568
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:17,339
good organic chicken yeah I mean I this

569
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,019
year was the year I was like I'm not

570
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:20,639
even gonna I've been trying to work it

571
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:22,319
out like been trying to like play that

572
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,000
game where I'm like I kind of want to

573
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,939
sell chickens as an Enterprise for the

574
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,400
farm you know as a you know Diversified

575
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,798
Farm like some playing around with it

576
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,900
for myself but I just

577
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:37,139
I kind of decided against it and just to

578
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,059
do it on my own scale because

579
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,340
you gotta put up it's just like you

580
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:42,658
gotta put up the money beforehand to

581
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:43,740
raise the chicken and it's an

582
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:47,240
interesting

583
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,240
it's an interesting gig like

584
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,859
that grain game it's just an industrial

585
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:55,699
game yeah have you tried breeding in uh

586
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:59,579
mealworms or uh chronic Soldier fly

587
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,500
larvae or yeah I haven't

588
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:03,178
um but I'm up by the border I think I'm

589
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,579
a little cold for the black soldier side

590
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,780
yeah you're up in Washington

591
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:08,639
um but that's kind of why I'm on the

592
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:11,460
worm thing because I I make a lot of

593
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,559
worms my soil is kind of mostly like a

594
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,019
I mean really it's like worm castings

595
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,240
pure is what I make in the end it's like

596
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,158
really but it's like low nitrogen you

597
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,419
know it's not super high nitrogen with

598
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,419
the balance I'm using and

599
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,860
um but yeah man I I think the bugs like

600
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:31,380
that's how you feed the chickens the

601
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:34,979
bugs that's the real ital way what's

602
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:37,679
your what's your other ideas on to

603
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,599
switching away from grain uh because I

604
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,220
know raising chickens it's such a

605
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,219
intense cost you know

606
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:48,359
yeah it's tough to like put that money

607
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:51,418
down every week or however long you

608
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:54,479
beautiful yeah yeah supporting those

609
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,860
huge great operations and

610
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,599
um and it's tough to find like really

611
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:58,859
good Organics have you figured out

612
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,519
anything

613
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:01,918
um

614
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,079
you know with your chickens to kind of

615
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,780
have as an alternative but you will

616
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,859
still get all their tight

617
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,579
not really

618
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:10,979
um

619
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:13,319
besides the worms I think that's that's

620
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,798
my like my scheme right now is to

621
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:20,099
develop like a an idea to maybe um do

622
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:23,639
like a fence like windrow with the

623
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,480
chickens in there maybe a coop situation

624
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,419
um

625
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,240
but I think really like chickens raising

626
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:32,038
like meat birds ideally you'd have like

627
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,558
a farm to table

628
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,900
uh or sorry uh

629
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,700
you know Farm to Market Garden of some

630
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,440
sort where you're like you got a lot of

631
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,340
extra produce and you're just tossing it

632
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,500
out

633
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:47,158
but you recently I've met this local

634
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:49,440
Farm to me and um they raise Hogs and

635
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:51,000
they actually grow all their like all

636
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,740
their own grain at this point and they

637
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,019
have they've invested in some of this

638
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,880
equipment where

639
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:58,859
like they're pretty small I think

640
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,280
they're like 15 or 20 acres and they're

641
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:03,959
growing like enough grain to feed like a

642
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:06,058
hundred pigs I don't even really know

643
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,919
how it's possible and they're organic

644
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:10,500
and they're you're trying to be

645
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,840
regenerative and I think growing our

646
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,359
grains and being slightly mechanized is

647
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,399
probably the the answer

648
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,859
um do they harvest the grain or do they

649
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,380
just let it let it go over and then let

650
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:24,839
the chickens free range on the fields or

651
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,020
they harvest and put it up and then they

652
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:30,658
put it up yeah enjoy it yeah I'm not 100

653
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:33,240
sure how but like

654
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:34,320
yeah there's they're really cool I'm

655
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,778
actually like

656
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,399
trying to like learn this from them and

657
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:41,339
uh

658
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,019
yeah because I actually started raising

659
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:45,119
pigs and that's kind of why I got out of

660
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:47,639
raising pigs I raised American guinea

661
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:51,798
Hogs they're these little uh

662
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,940
lard pigs and little black cute furry

663
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:58,079
pigs and they make like really really

664
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:00,720
good meat but it's super super fatty and

665
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,519
I would uh I would get all their feed

666
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,860
from a local Brewery

667
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:07,619
I'd just be like dude like fill up my

668
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:10,500
garbage can and like they were they're

669
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:15,359
just trying to get rid of it spent part

670
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,500
yeah and um and rye and we depend with

671
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,979
their Brewing

672
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,538
uh you know mixes of all that stuff and

673
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,000
it was it was like they're happy

674
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:27,119
together too yeah there's like all these

675
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,599
uh waste you know streams that we can

676
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:33,479
take and turn into like value for our

677
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:35,240
Farms I think that's like

678
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,339
like a real big

679
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,778
way to like attempt to be regenerative

680
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:42,538
is so like there's all these

681
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:45,119
unsustainable businesses out there

682
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:47,579
that have access you know maybe they got

683
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,139
extra breweries at the grain or the

684
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:52,439
mushroom Farms are the mushroom blocks

685
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,538
but like that shit is gold to us and

686
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,600
like you know maybe I worry about like

687
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:59,579
the breweries having like glyphosate all

688
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,319
over that grain now and that's kind of

689
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:02,579
also why I stopped doing the pigs that

690
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,339
way and I'm like

691
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,918
you know it's just like a glyphosate

692
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:09,839
slurry

693
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,419
you know it was like beer I like had

694
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,278
like I like beer I used to like beer but

695
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,440
uh

696
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,319
um

697
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,179
I think like closing other people's

698
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:23,220
needs is like a it's like almost the

699
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:25,259
easiest place for anybody to start being

700
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,019
regenerative

701
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:31,200
you know I don't know like dude there's

702
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:33,720
so much fuckery out there like just pop

703
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,500
up someone else's mess yeah and then

704
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,679
like

705
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,179
that'll just get you ahead to where you

706
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,100
can like

707
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:44,100
I don't know I can buy jars to sell my

708
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,778
weed because I don't buy soil and

709
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:47,639
it's dope

710
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:51,380
and yeah

711
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:54,120
I can buy labels I don't buy chicken

712
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,860
so you don't really need that much

713
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,079
actually I think you you did you ever

714
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:59,819
you have a question behind Noble oh I

715
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,658
just was

716
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:02,658
what bigger soil building

717
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,778
person might think about

718
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,778
um

719
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,079
yeah poison oak

720
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,299
um but I mean if you're breaking it down

721
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,859
like I'm I do the thermophilic thing and

722
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:24,058
I know like some people don't like that

723
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:26,639
because you're off gas in carbon and all

724
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:28,740
kinds of stuff but uh if you're doing

725
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,200
the thermophilic it

726
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:34,200
I'd do anything like I I don't know I

727
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,360
I'll put my chicken bones in my worm bin

728
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,580
and that'll get turned into the mix I I

729
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:40,199
just put everything in

730
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:42,599
um

731
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,640
you're getting those mushroom blocks you

732
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,259
have to worry about muscle size on them

733
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,440
and stuff like that and there's nothing

734
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:51,240
best kind of stuff oh you do yeah so

735
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,820
it's like I think it's really important

736
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,819
that you're working with a certified

737
00:28:53,819 --> 00:29:00,418
organic at minimum and

738
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:04,139
like that's that minimum I like it I

739
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:05,640
really trust the people I work with but

740
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,278
um the first season that we actually

741
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,720
like made a whole batch of soil

742
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:11,519
um it was actually the first season we

743
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,679
were like working on getting our damn

744
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,778
pure certification and the den Pier

745
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,580
certification like

746
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:19,259
you need to have clean inputs is like

747
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:21,119
the bit is one of the biggest things

748
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,278
about it so

749
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,459
uh we actually yeah got we got a

750
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:29,339
pesticide tested after we made it and

751
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,259
it was it came out clean so it was like

752
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:33,058
none detected and so that was really

753
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:35,398
great it wasn't a big surprise because

754
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:37,079
we thought you know but if you if you're

755
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,239
going into like some outfit you don't

756
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,819
know like my friend owns the mushroom

757
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,940
farm too so I know he's passionate and

758
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:47,220
he has really good value so like

759
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,480
just a great fit you know I save him a

760
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,480
lot of Labor I save him

761
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:56,579
six hours a week you know like it's a

762
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:59,038
serious thing all year like he they love

763
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:01,439
me coming to the farm like I'm the most

764
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,179
consistent person too like the other

765
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,980
people come and get mushroom blocks but

766
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,559
like I'm always

767
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,720
you know I'm always there every week and

768
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:11,038
sometimes it takes consistency to do

769
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,679
that but

770
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:16,140
I live out a little bit out of town you

771
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,360
know like 45 minutes out of town so it's

772
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,159
like my once a week I get to drive to

773
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:22,319
town and go shopping so it's like I'm

774
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,419
already needing to do that shit anyways

775
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,339
and fold it in there do you harvest

776
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,778
mushrooms coming out of your bed are

777
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:30,480
there the watts are still pretty

778
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:32,038
prolific dude yeah Russian blacks are

779
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,380
the shit they're they're fucking gold

780
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,058
dude like you pile them up and then you

781
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,500
you take them off the mushroom farm and

782
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:39,720
like they're trying to hit their numbers

783
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,220
and they have stuff coming out of the

784
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,259
incubation room

785
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,538
that needs to go on the shelf and it's

786
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:47,220
just a it's just a timing game so

787
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:49,079
there's so much life left in the

788
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,079
mushroom block like

789
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:54,658
yeah it's it's just full and so like if

790
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,038
it rains like in the shoulder Seasons uh

791
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:58,020
the mushroom block piles like the

792
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:00,960
collection piles would just be full like

793
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:02,759
my my crew like my staff will just go

794
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,759
out and harvest mushrooms and we all eat

795
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:09,359
good like none of us are eating shiitake

796
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,619
or oysters nobody's buying that that

797
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,839
stuff you know this time of year

798
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:14,398
especially it's getting a little cold

799
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:17,038
now but we just had like some good

800
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,019
flushes Springtime is really really

801
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,778
really good

802
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:23,940
um yeah I mean my shoebox they're spun

803
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:25,740
like I fill in like

804
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,140
you know ruts or something on the ground

805
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,278
and then there's like oyster mushrooms

806
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,020
and like

807
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,880

810
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:40,019

811
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,759
where I had like mounded beds and I was

812
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:42,898
like tripping and slipping in there I'm

813
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,000
like I just want it to be a little more

814
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:46,939
flat in the garden and I and I just

815
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,099
filled it with mushroom blocks and then

816
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:53,519
that that year was just like

817
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:56,398

Oyster was it you that Joey that cut a

821
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:05,398
hole on a block and like put soil on

822
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,320
there and grew a plant I don't know this

823
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:09,538
is fun oyster blacks are silly I mean

824
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:11,519

00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,360
yeah dude if you guys are getting white

829
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,159
russian box dude that's my that's the

830
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:22,798
shit but wood chips are the shit too

831
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,080
like that's gold

832
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,480
your soil building yeah

833
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:31,918
yeah good you know find a good organic

834
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,679
Dairy like to get your cow manure cowser

835
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,120
I think like Nick Nick said to me like

836
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,220
some greens are starting to tell me that

837
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,619
like they're the original Korean natural

838
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:44,759
farmer the cow you know because they

839
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:47,819
have like this amazing gut that

840
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:49,740
that the rumen and uh

841
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:52,200
it's just like fair man did you know you

842
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:54,480
put grass in a bucket of water it just

843
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,759
smells like cow shit in like a couple

844
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,179
weeks it's the same exact thing

845
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,980
it's not even that complicated but

846
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:04,320
yeah that's that's what's up with my

847
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:07,500
farm we just like make our own soil with

848
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:10,439
mushroom blocks and hay and manure and

849
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:13,319
it works out really well I mean just do

850
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,940
it early is the biggest advice I give

851
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,980
people like just you'll have a lot

852
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:19,320
better success if you don't

853
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,659
you know push push it like I was trying

854
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:23,819
to run a wrecked Farm

855
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:26,519
keeping flour on the Shelf all season

856
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:29,398
long which is what I do and I have done

857
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:30,659
for seven years like not and I've never

858
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:32,579
like

859
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:34,140
I guess it'd be nice to run out of weed

860
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,960
you know that'd be actually pretty sweet

861
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:39,720
to like sell all your weed

862
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,940
but uh you know making our own soil out

863
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,860
of mushroom blocks and fucking hey I'm

864
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,360
just I'm stoked on that it's really a

865
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:48,599
rewarding thing

866
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:51,599
and I think like it's kind of

867
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:53,579
it's a little mystical like you know

868
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,199
everybody just realizing potting soil

869
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:57,658
it's just a hard hard thing to get away

870
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,340
from is anybody here like gotten away

871
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,760
from potting soil by chance

872
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:05,519
yeah let's let's have what's your step

873
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:07,740
um I mean we made our own soil for all

874
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,440
of our beds uh for our farm over in

875
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,878
Laytonville uh we had a lot of big bio

876
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,139
storages that we've been keeping on the

877
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:14,819
property

878
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:18,240
um a lot of logs that we had buried with

879
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:20,220
top soil that had sat for years we ended

880
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,858
up making Google beds with

881
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:24,358
um we did bring in rice holes and then

882
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:27,239
we had wood chips from like local tree

883
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:30,119
cutting different things like that and

884
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,638
um yeah and then just a lot of covered

885
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,980
crops and chopping and dropping and yeah

886
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,539
compost and uh yeah a lot of water

887
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,940
everywhere

888
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:42,000
um yeah different goat manure we had

889
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:44,280
chickens we had turkeys you know so yeah

890
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,719
a lot of local inputs and yeah just

891
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,119
whatever we're able to gather on the

892
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:50,878
land and I mean it cost us next oh and

893
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,980
then uh some actually some old soil we

894
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,319
cleaned up off of a property cleanup

895
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,539
from the organic garden that we uh

896
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:01,220
integrated into it as you know pretty

897
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:01,219
basic you know completed soil but

898
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,300
you know after a couple years it was the

899
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:20,578
most light fluffy consistently moist

900
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,339
soil and it cost it was next to nothing

901
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,500
yeah oh yeah that's what it's about

902
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:28,019
and like I think when I tell people like

903
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,159
I make my own potting toilet a lot of

904
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:30,420
people are like wow what do you use for

905
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:32,039
aeration like they're surprised they

906
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,500
don't use perlite or like gravel or

907
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:36,539
something and like

908
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,519
yeah I'm not suggesting somebody go

909
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:39,239
around like their full wreck indoor I'm

910
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:41,338
like

911
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:42,598
wood chips off the ground and make you

912
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:44,279
know do the same thing I'm doing I'm

913
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,900
saying like make your potting soil for

914
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,720
your outdoor farm and plant your plants

915
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,760
in the ground or your beds that's like

916
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:54,239
I'm really into that and like

917
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,579
the thing about the no aeration is that

918
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,959
yeah it's not like growing in potting

919
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:00,900
soil it's different you have to be

920
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,820
careful not to over water especially

921
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,800
um especially early in the colder times

922
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:08,160
of the year

923
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,220
um and you'll if you don't have like if

924
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:13,500
you didn't let your soil fully cook or

925
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:15,059
fully like you know let the worms go

926
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,099
through it and

927
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:19,019
it's done and

928
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,400
you'll know be like you'll know it's

929
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:22,139
done because it kind of gets to a

930
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,079
certain size and it stops getting

931
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:27,179
smaller pretty much at the at the very

932
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,920
end of like heat it up a couple times

933
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:29,759
you turned it a couple times you sifted

934
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,220
it

935
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,859
and then you gotta let it like really

936
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:37,319
like sit there in a pile and like it'll

937
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:38,940
just kind of almost shrink because you

938
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,700
kind of aerated it it looks bigger than

939
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,338
it is with that sifting it'll kind of go

940
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,799
down if you don't like really let it sit

941
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:49,199
you'll you'll find that your plants will

942
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,859
probably do great I mean I

943
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,659
my plans to do great but um

944
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,219
as you're like

945
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:58,500
by the time you transplant your plant

946
00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:00,779
like you're happy on pot it'll go from

947
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,000
like this much snow like the pots about

948
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,859
that big it'll be like a little muffin

949
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,679
like a little like it'll be almost like

950
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:09,539
two-thirds the size it'll it'll just

951
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,819
compress a little bit and this is

952
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:13,980
something I've noticed so

953
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,740
just having your soil done early like

954
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,619
I'm trying to get a year ahead like

955
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:22,739
that's my goal so I already have my pile

956
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:26,099
almost collected for next year right now

957
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:28,399
it's kind of the cycle I'm on and and

958
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:31,859
that's that's the hard part is like

959
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,539
being really dedicated to it for like

960
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:35,098
you just have to be it's like you have

961
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:37,079
to be dedicated like that's like a

962
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:40,320
couple years I got planned out and I'm

963
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,240
already executing six months ago I

964
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,500
started executing like the picking up

965
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:49,379
that pile so it's a long game but

966
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,239
but that's like

967
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,740
that's how you do it that's how you like

968
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:55,078
successfully

969
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:57,299
improve your land and

970
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,339
close your Loops is like thinking like

971
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:03,180
what do I what I'm going to be what am I

972
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:05,759
going to be doing in like two years like

973
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:08,279
for this soil like

974
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,320
I'm like two in two years I'll be trying

975
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,640
to get two years ahead on my soil pile I

976
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,039
feel

977
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:15,779
like it um

978
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,219
yeah that's my thoughts on that I don't

979
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,420
know if anybody else has any questions

980
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:19,919
but

981
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,780
if we're about to like get into some

982
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,320
tunes or something

983
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:29,099
okay anybody anybody not anybody not

984
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:32,280
using potting soil for the nursery work

985
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:34,260
uh yeah maybe do some sifting get get

986
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,380
after it I'd say it'd be really cool to

987
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,380
see

988
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,000
cool

989
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,079
well every time that I'm planting

990
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,260
anything or getting more dirt I'm

991
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,599
missing in like native soil or like

992
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:56,060
whatever I'm sweeping up leaves are

993
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,059
leopard needles or you know

994
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:00,539
put a rabbit for a while and I was like

995
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,760
putting wood chips in with the rabbit

996
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:05,219
and taking the rabbit pods and the wood

997
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,560
chips and mixing that straight in with

998
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:11,838
the soil with my compost mixing the

999
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,838
native soil into my compost yeah

1000
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,099
[Music]

1001
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,079
yeah I know and like maybe starting with

1002
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:21,059
like initially starting with like some

1003
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,039
potting soil you ran like that's gold

1004
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,838
right there if somebody has potting soil

1005
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,639
it's clean you know it's clean that's a

1006
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:28,739
really especially around here in the

1007
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:32,879
Triangle like right especially right now

1008
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:34,139
yeah who's got organic potting soil I

1009
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,599
mean it's it's hard I feel like it's

1010
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:39,000
hard to like you gotta really trust your

1011
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,619
farmer you know what materials you're

1012
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,900
gonna get you know like what are they

1013
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,700
what are they been spraying on that you

1014
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,820
know it's really important to know but

1015
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:50,279
man it's it's gold like potting soil pot

1016
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:53,280
like pots like if you could pick up

1017
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,140
pots of potting soil from like some cool

1018
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,820
like Alpine glow Farm I would be like

1019
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:59,940
all over that shit like that would be

1020
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,599
amazing not the day we'd sell that yeah

1021
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,980
um

1022
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,400
I don't know I'm sure there's some like

1023
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:07,260
good organic Potter farms around here

1024
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,119
anyways yeah

1025
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,160
Joey what do you want to do

1026
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,640
what's next on the

1027
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:17,279
any time keep going you can wrap it up

1028
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:20,400
you've been loving it I mean I'm I'm a

1029
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,380
little out of fuel but like

1030
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,619
what are you guys gonna talk about

1031
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,619
foreign

1032
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,439
[Music]

1033
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:43,460
man the regenerative farmer

1034
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,460
I think it's like

1035
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:49,139
you know consolidation has hit

1036
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:50,699
Washington pretty hard just like the

1037
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:52,980
whole West Coast it's it's almost the

1038
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:55,559
same thing it's like they decided to

1039
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,559
like screw all the small farmers over in

1040
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:00,358
like slightly different ways

1041
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:02,460
Oliver you know especially on the west

1042
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:05,759
coast here like you guys got distro

1043
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,980
issues here and and Cali and like in

1044
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,420
Washington like there's just not enough

1045
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:14,820
stores to sell our herb so most of the

1046
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,920
far I mean there's not a lot of farms

1047
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,599
that are trying to do regenerative stuff

1048
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,338
in Washington and like they're kind of

1049
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,320
dropping like flies the people that were

1050
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:24,000
in the game and

1051
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,039
um just like everybody's dropping like

1052
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,900
flies like no matter what you're doing

1053
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:29,400
right now

1054
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,680
um

1055
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,838
personally like I'm waiting I'm like

1056
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,838
every year I'm like am I gonna do that

1057
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,179
again like it appears like the price

1058
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:41,699
drops and

1059
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:44,519
the retail price always stays the same

1060
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:46,679
and and that's just hard to like face

1061
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,259
every every year over and over again

1062
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:51,539
it's just a grind like

1063
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,280
and you know I want to educate the

1064
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:56,880
consumer about like you know why

1065
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,980
regenerative you know Sun drone like

1066
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,980
pesticide free cannabis is like so much

1067
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,539
better like grown from seed like bred by

1068
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,320
the farmer like

1069
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:09,838
you know so single Source like making

1070
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:13,099
the freaking potting soil like

1071
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:15,119
I want I want the consumer to to

1072
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:16,980
appreciate that but I just feel like the

1073
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,099
Market's not really there yet

1074
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,719
and um at all I think it's like five to

1075
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:23,579
ten years away from that I think like

1076
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:26,219
seriously like Nick from Green Storage

1077
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:29,519
Garden and and Josh and Kelly from

1078
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:32,039
dragonflyers medicine are literally

1079
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,900
maybe the only people really pushing for

1080
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,358
that

1081
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,280
in a real way like I'm that they're not

1082
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:40,019
the only people but like they're they're

1083
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,079
pushing for it the most I think like

1084
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:45,838
they're educating people on really like

1085
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:47,820
getting the message out

1086
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:51,078
um they're not the only people

1087
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,079
um at all but uh

1088
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:56,159
I think we're just waiting for like

1089
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,680
Federal changes on like Banking and

1090
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,779
whatnot like I can't own my farm because

1091
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:02,338
I can't get a mortgage you know like and

1092
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,440
I I don't have

1093
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:06,420
a quarter million dollars in my pocket

1094
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,980
or anything like I'm making I'm trying

1095
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,780
to make soil

1096
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,059
hey you got a question

1097
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,920
um I was just gonna say like um

1098
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:16,259
I like the idea of like yeah

1099
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,280
adaptability where you start realizing

1100
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,280
that maybe this is gone

1101
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:24,180
um but then you kind of wanted to

1102
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:29,699
um

1103
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:29,699
with that Rec industry idea of uh

1104
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:43,380
it's okay we all just smoke that hookah

1105
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,519
man I'm like I feel the same way

1106
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,740
that's something you were just saying

1107
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:48,420
but oh yeah are you worried about the

1108
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:50,759
FDA getting involved how do you feel

1109
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,139
about that yeah I'm like I don't care

1110
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,060
I'm like

1111
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:55,739
I just want like something to change so

1112
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:58,679
I could get like an operating loan

1113
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:00,719
almost for my business like to just be

1114
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:03,960
treated like a normal business to where

1115
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,939
like if we're like struggling

1116
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,920
I could get a loan to like pay my staff

1117
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,818
just so I don't to fire everybody you

1118
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,400
know like

1119
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:13,679
the second you think like I think I'm

1120
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,660
getting somewhere like oh sales are good

1121
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,399
it's like then you got two three months

1122
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:20,039
of bad sales and like

1123
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:24,180
it's just that's how the wreck Mark has

1124
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:25,980
been for me it hasn't been like

1125
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:29,399
like I got my wrecked license I'm like

1126
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,838
energy full blast social media we're

1127
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,579
doing this and then over the years I'm

1128
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:37,019
just like man

1129
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:40,619
ah it's I was I still love I love the

1130
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:42,420
the work but it's just it's just hard to

1131
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:44,700
like yell that from the rooftops and

1132
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,800
then they just want cheap ounces because

1133
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:50,460
of outdoors and I'm like this isn't she

1134
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,560
bounces man like this is like some this

1135
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,019
is better than like all the weed on the

1136
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,960
Shelf here like this is a lot of love

1137
00:44:55,019 --> 00:45:00,420
put into it and it's Unique you know we

1138
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,300
don't I I don't grow necessarily like

1139
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,460
what's hot on the market or like I don't

1140
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,440
go GMO like I'm growing

1141
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,119
something me and my friends bread you

1142
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,300
know like something Brandon bread or

1143
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,019
Joey bread or tomorrow like

1144
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,720
um

1145
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:19,619
yeah like we're very very unique strains

1146
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:21,598
and like it's it's it's hard to it's

1147
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:24,119
hard to be looked at on this wreck

1148
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,039
Market as just outdoor or indoor and

1149
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,740
that's how the Washington Market has

1150
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:31,980
just it's just that way and Washington's

1151
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:34,078
always been really indoor hungry

1152
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,539
um in in the medical days it's just

1153
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,220
ravenous for indoor okay you got yeah I

1154
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:39,659
was just gonna almost say like the

1155
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:42,118
person who's like looking down the line

1156
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:44,639
like you're saying a quality is a little

1157
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,079
more uh hesitant to just like be like

1158
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:47,578
here's the way you need to take it you

1159
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,599
know kind of like what Joey said the

1160
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,980
other day about like take everything

1161
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,359
we're saying with a grain of salt

1162
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,400
because it might be different in your

1163
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,199
world yeah so I think because of that

1164
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,300
little bit of a hesitation to like say

1165
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,759
hey this is the way or whatever

1166
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,099
what you see out there like a lot with

1167
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,839
uh the internet and YouTube and stuff

1168
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,420
nowadays just like tons of people just

1169
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,400
projecting so much more multitude of

1170
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,800
information that they're like certain

1171
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,619
this is it you know yeah so that's why I

1172
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,780
feel like disconnected uh the educated

1173
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:17,539
consumer is kind of what I'm looking at

1174
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,980
because that they're they're getting

1175
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:21,719
barrage with tons of information there's

1176
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,818
like a one or two or a handful of videos

1177
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:25,318
that are along this line because it's

1178
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:26,818
like they're all all the people doing

1179
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:28,980
those videos are also trying to do the

1180
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:30,539
work you know and then and then do the

1181
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,579
video at the same time you know yeah

1182
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:34,139
whereas everybody else just like blasts

1183
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:36,060
you with like your Zone just trying to

1184
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:38,699
make a buck yeah there's a lot of noise

1185
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:40,440
out there it's like like sorting through

1186
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:42,419
all that noise yeah I mean it's always

1187
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,000
it kind of reminds me of like back in

1188
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:47,519
the day like going on to like forums

1189
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,219
like I was on

1190
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,920
whatever like icy mag or something like

1191
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:55,500
there's just so much shit to get through

1192
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,900
before you get to like the real stuff

1193
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,400
and the normal consumers like that's

1194
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:03,780
where they're at they're like you're

1195
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,780
there's just too much yeah

1196
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,480
I mean there's so much

1197
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,940
dank that has no heart out there and

1198
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,740
that's a hard thing as like a farmer

1199
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,079
that Farms with a lot of heart when I

1200
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:17,939
put dank out there it's like sitting

1201
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,160
next to dank with no heart and like in

1202
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,960
Washington nobody gets to smell it so

1203
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:24,719
then like nobody gets to know it's just

1204
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,780
a kind of a heart crushing industry

1205
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:26,779
um

1206
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:30,420
I mean God I don't I don't even want to

1207
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,920
get it under like you know the

1208
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,440
depression of

1209
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,200
just that

1210
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,039
the Cannabis farmer in general is just

1211
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:42,118
like

1212
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:43,800
it's been ground down and I think uh

1213
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:46,380
I think it's I think people just should

1214
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,180
do black market I think like as somebody

1215
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:51,059
has been in the rack market for I've had

1216
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:51,960
seven years my wreck license I I think

1217
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:54,900
like

1218
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,639
I love I love like my farm and I love

1219
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,900
what I'm doing but like if someone's

1220
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,779
getting into this right now I'm like

1221
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:03,240
dude just represent yourself and be your

1222
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:06,540
true authentic self

1223
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:08,519
and you don't need to be like licensed

1224
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:10,858
you may you know protection is good like

1225
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:13,800
a medical permit I totally suggest

1226
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:16,858
people carry you know but like

1227
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,900
more and more like

1228
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:21,480
there's just like not there's not a lot

1229
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:24,059
in it for the small family farm in the

1230
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,858
rec market with the consolidation that's

1231
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:28,739
occurring and I think there's a select

1232
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:31,619
few that are able to somehow navigate it

1233
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:34,318
but it's through a lot of sacrifice and

1234
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:36,539
like it's it's hard for them for us to

1235
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,099
do it forever

1236
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:41,579
um I'm hoping for like Federal

1237
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:43,980
legalization like Banks can like I I

1238
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:46,079
could actually like get a mortgage on my

1239
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,818
farm and I could maybe get operation

1240
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,380
operating them get some more greenhouses

1241
00:48:47,818 --> 00:48:50,579
make it my life a little easier or

1242
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,079
something like that I probably wouldn't

1243
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,180
actually get more green asses

1244
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,460
but um

1245
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:57,598
you know kitchen or something like that

1246
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,159
yeah

1247
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,920
um earlier you kind of said it's about

1248
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:04,379
the long game yeah and I I really

1249
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,119
appreciate that thought because like as

1250
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,099
we're watching this industry fall like

1251
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,680
that as long as you're able to maintain

1252
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:13,019
through it and keep focused on your like

1253
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:14,879
mission in the end all of a sudden

1254
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:16,380
there's going to be a shortage we're

1255
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,059
gonna hit a shortage here at some point

1256
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,920
and prices are coming up through the

1257
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:21,838
roof I know if your quality is still

1258
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,880
there you're at least on the top end of

1259
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:26,578
that yeah if six companies are making

1260
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,619
all the weed in California at that

1261
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:30,780
moment is the moment where small farmers

1262
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:33,180
might start doing better you know like

1263
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,920
but it's gonna be so hard getting to

1264
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,598
that moment for all of us like it

1265
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,780
happened in the Brewing industry you

1266
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:42,119
know there was like a big microbrew boom

1267
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:44,640
and everybody's just drank the shoes and

1268
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:46,260
then like it went away and now now in

1269
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,618
Bellingham where I'm from there's like

1270
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:51,780
20 breweries it's wild it's like the

1271
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:54,180
Heyday Brewery Brewing is going on right

1272
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:56,099
now so I I see the same thing with

1273
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:58,440
cannabis it's just like

1274
00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:00,240
we're gonna get ground down there's

1275
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,099
gonna be like a couple people that make

1276
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:05,838
it and like

1277
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,838
I don't know I don't know like

1278
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:10,379
like who who wants to be the just shoots

1279
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,719
like it's not the that's not where my

1280
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,700
values are like so

1281
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:17,219
I'm just trying to like just make the

1282
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:18,960
soil keep selling this flower I had a

1283
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:20,338
good season this year and I was just

1284
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,559
surprised because it was just a really

1285
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:23,279
hard year

1286
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,099
um

1287
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,720
in Spring especially and like I feel

1288
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:29,640
like something's driving me to just keep

1289
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:31,139
doing it which is cool and I'm into it

1290
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:33,259
but

1291
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:33,259
um

1292
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,920
but yeah man the Market's hard I hope

1293
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,900
everybody's like holding on there and

1294
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,480
like you know I got solidarity with

1295
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:46,760
anybody holding onto a bunch of herb

1296
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,760
right now on the shelves for sure yeah

1297
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:52,440
but hash is really big I mean I see

1298
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:55,019
everybody kind of running into the hash

1299
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,838
Market I don't know about uh California

1300
00:50:55,019 --> 00:51:01,199
but in Washington it's like

1301
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:03,719
I'm doing it I mean I just I'm I just

1302
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:07,019
built a little washroom and that's my

1303
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:09,480
plan is people don't judge

1304
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:12,119
resin like they judge flower it's not

1305
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,639
outdoor versus indoor with residence

1306
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:15,660
it's like it's resin is it fire or is it

1307
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:19,139
not fire

1308
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:21,358
and uh I think that's a that's a

1309
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:23,460
potential I think that's the best shot

1310
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:25,199
actually a lot of small farms have

1311
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,039
especially

1312
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,558
um

1313
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:30,239
in in places where like indoors just

1314
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,880
heavily consumed and like the stores

1315
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:34,379
want indoor and like that's that's a lot

1316
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,420
of people have been taught to judges

1317
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,720
that way yeah it's like in the visual

1318
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:41,760
Market yeah yeah

1319
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:43,318
it's rough how did the sativa Indica

1320
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,940
thing where people are like to finish a

1321
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:48,599
few lives because you realize that music

1322
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:50,940
just kiddingly you care about the police

1323
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:54,019
you know what I mean or what do you know

1324
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:56,880
what I mean that's what they should

1325
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:59,039
it's endlessly frustrating like the big

1326
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,200
the idea of the visual market like we

1327
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:02,639
it's important for sure to have

1328
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:03,960
something that's visually pleasing like

1329
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:06,058
something that we want to eat or put

1330
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,619
into our body that looks like ooh that's

1331
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:10,140
juicy like give me that like it's a

1332
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:12,720
steak or whatever but

1333
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:15,179
um but yeah like that's literally all

1334
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:16,558
the Washington Market is like I said I

1335
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:18,358
have to sell my you know stuff

1336
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,240
pre-packaged

1337
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:23,519
and like no nobody even does sniff jars

1338
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:25,139
anymore like when I started wreck like

1339
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:27,119
you'd sell some weed and they'd be like

1340
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:28,739
send a sniff jar with it and at this

1341
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,019
point like we're like 10 years into

1342
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:33,239
legalization in Washington like

1343
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:35,759
we don't nobody gets no we don't even

1344
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:36,779
fucking do that anymore it's just it's

1345
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,700
weak

1346
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:42,119
oh yeah

1347
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:44,639
Echo does like uh break down on their

1348
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:48,480
packaging in like the dream area and

1349
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,480
stuff like that you know yeah

1350
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:52,800
um and uh I kind of wonder why I don't

1351
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:55,380
see that more in Washington when I'm up

1352
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,059
there turkey and cats you know just like

1353
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,740
so you can't open the package is what

1354
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:00,720
you're saying no that's right I think is

1355
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:03,419
insane

1356
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:05,159
um then like why can't you list what it

1357
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,599
should like if people understood the

1358
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:08,460
person you break down what flavor

1359
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,500
profile they might be hitting off those

1360
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,300
servings then at least you could show

1361
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,579
the consumer like but here's what it

1362
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,920
here's the serpent breakdown of it on

1363
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:18,599
the back but they haven't even gone down

1364
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,039
that one they're just like nope you just

1365
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:22,440
have to guess I hope you know this

1366
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:24,539
string yeah actually in Washington you

1367
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,838
know I I am able to put my troops on

1368
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:29,099
there on my packaging so you do I do

1369
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,219
yeah yeah

1370
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:33,598
[Music]

1371
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:35,159
everybody does something different like

1372
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,838
there's actually it is cool in

1373
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:38,578
Washington we can brand our own stuff

1374
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:41,219
like I have my brand it's called Eagle

1375
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:43,440
trees that's my farm name that's the

1376
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:44,039
farm me and my sister you know run and

1377
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,220
um

1378
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:51,659
yeah we like Jarred up and everything

1379
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:53,759
and uh we put our like top let me take

1380
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:56,460
like the the top like five chirps and we

1381
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,140
put that on there like you know we kind

1382
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,000
of art it up our tee it up a little bit

1383
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:02,219
you know make it nice looking so people

1384
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,440
know like oh this is an osamine or the

1385
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:05,879
summer scene kind of dominant just put

1386
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,460
the dominant Terps on there I don't put

1387
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,838
like the whole test but a lot of fun a

1388
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,338
lot of places now I don't know if in

1389
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:13,500
Cali I'm sure they're doing this but

1390
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:15,539
they do like a QR code and it'll take

1391
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,980
and that'll take you to the test and

1392
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:19,039
that's super cool

1393
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,039
um

1394
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:30,000
yeah I've seen that in other places

1395
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:31,679
where I'm just like are you sure that's

1396
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,659
really what it is or somebody just tell

1397
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,379
you that it's you know it's all in the

1398
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:38,818
honor System and yeah

1399
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,559
you know like my my whole Farm is

1400
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:42,358
hammered out like in Washington we're

1401
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,700
required to have like every square inch

1402
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:47,000
hammered out but in in the end it's all

1403
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:49,980
it's all on your honor and like it's

1404
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,338
frustrating from the perspective someone

1405
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:57,300
who is like trying to play by the rules

1406
00:54:53,338 --> 00:54:59,159
and that are set forth seeing how much

1407
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,599
of it is on the honor System and at the

1408
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,699
same time not wanting more regulation

1409
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:06,480
but knowing the Bad actors can do so

1410
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:09,139
much you know they're just so so I mean

1411
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:13,039
God damn like so much

1412
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:16,139
yeah and uh this guy was saying

1413
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:18,960
like I was like by the time you're

1414
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:21,179
accustomed like those cards is gone I'm

1415
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,280
like because we're doing two small batch

1416
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:25,019
you know and then I kind of went down

1417
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,059
the lines of like what if that QR code

1418
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:29,280
just took you to a website that was more

1419
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:30,900
along the lines of what to look for to

1420
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,579
ask this guy well first of all he

1421
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,380
probably ask them about this because

1422
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,880
they're going to scan the QR code so one

1423
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:38,480
of you just directed their knowledge in

1424
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,480
a different way

1425
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,180
it would have to be safe

1426
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:07,920
you know you get something and steer

1427
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:10,980
towards you know hey you know I I like

1428
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:14,519
the the suggestion of something and then

1429
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:16,139
make them know yeah

1430
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:18,780
yeah

1431
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:21,299
it's like it's all about like what the

1432
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,800
bud tender knows like really in the end

1433
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,900
like

1434
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,780
so from like the farmer's perspective

1435
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:31,619
like for my like I think we just need to

1436
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:33,540
be really transparent and almost like

1437
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:35,160
I don't know what else you do besides

1438
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:37,440
like you gotta have the bud tenders come

1439
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:39,299
to like your farm you know like that's

1440
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,760
what I literally do I have like every

1441
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,500
summer this summer I didn't do it just

1442
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,619
because like it was a rough year but uh

1443
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:49,019
I usually do like a summer uh Bud tender

1444
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:52,079
party and I have like all the butt

1445
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:54,900
tenders from all my accounts and the I

1446
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:57,660
just invite their whole staff and we put

1447
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,639
on this party and like

1448
00:56:57,659 --> 00:57:01,440
you know it costs the money to put the

1449
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:03,900
party on like you know have some food

1450
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,760
and like get some rent some tents and

1451
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,940
some chairs and stuff but yeah we get to

1452
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,220
have like 50 bartenders come through

1453
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:13,318
like three times during the day and like

1454
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:15,539
see what we're doing and get the whole

1455
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:17,579
rundown and I I answer every question

1456
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:20,400
and like

1457
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:22,859
yeah to have them know what the what the

1458
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,960
fuck's going on at the farm like

1459
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:26,699
you know if if you don't have your farm

1460
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,679
they won't know shit about your farm I

1461
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:30,239
don't know like it's yeah that's it's

1462
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:31,318
important especially to stand out

1463
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,419
because

1464
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:35,759
when they go to like a big wreck farm

1465
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:38,400
for a like a huge like you know

1466
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,079
corporatized wreck Farm it's gonna be

1467
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,818
cool because they're like walking

1468
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:45,059
through the fields and they're gonna be

1469
00:57:41,818 --> 00:57:46,558
like oh yeah this is like runs and this

1470
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:48,720
is GMO

1471
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:52,260
but if you take them through your field

1472
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:55,199
and you're like oh this is my this is my

1473
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:57,180
Rolex F5 I've been breeding this here on

1474
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,799
this land for four years and I've been

1475
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:01,019
making all the soil it's like literally

1476
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:03,599
meant to grow here and it grows here

1477
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:05,460
super well now and like there's just so

1478
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,160
much more of a story to tell you're like

1479
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:11,519
all of a sudden you're like

1480
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:15,299
you're not growing mids you're growing

1481
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:17,219
that fine wine like you want them to

1482
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,559
to know you're you're putting something

1483
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:22,078
out there that's actually special and

1484
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:25,260
not just like

1485
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,700
yeah not a men's Factory so yeah I think

1486
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:28,740
having people out to the farm is the

1487
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:30,118
shit like buyers like don't be smoking

1488
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:31,799
mirrors like

1489
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:33,780
have them out and show them what you're

1490
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,940
doing and like be real like you know

1491
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,740
maybe clean the place up but you're

1492
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,480
walking by something like

1493
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:41,399
yeah maybe you're like yeah that doesn't

1494
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,318
look as good as I want it to look like

1495
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,139
modesty goes a long way I think people

1496
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:48,000
like

1497
00:58:45,139 --> 00:58:51,239
appreciate when you want to do better

1498
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,280
you know as a farmer I think like a lot

1499
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:54,179
of the Farms are just real broad out and

1500
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,599
like

1501
00:58:54,179 --> 00:58:59,578
you got these numbers we're fucking like

1502
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:01,619
full on canopy like

1503
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,000
like perfect and

1504
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:04,680
in the end they're just got all these

1505
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,260
dirty little secrets they're spraying a

1506
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:09,419
lot of pesticide and they're like they

1507
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:10,260
got arrested mites and so it's just been

1508
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:13,318
like

1509
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:15,720
a war and

1510
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:17,039
I don't know like at least if you have

1511
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,838
an award like maybe you have the

1512
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:21,179
Bloodhound be like yeah we had this war

1513
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:22,980
we sprayed JMS and like we made it with

1514
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:25,019
the mint in the garden here and this is

1515
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:26,880
how we did it it's like

1516
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:30,179
it's just so much more interesting and

1517
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:33,559
like palatable the small farm aspect you

1518
00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:33,558
win every time so

1519
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,440
I don't think the small farmer has the

1520
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:39,539
option of like hiding anymore I think

1521
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,880
like that's where I came from like I was

1522
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:43,500
hiding in a basement growing indoors is

1523
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:46,140
kind of where I came from

1524
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:49,079
and like it's hard to come out of that

1525
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:50,338
for me I think it also creates a sense

1526
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:52,380
of mirror like you're saying about

1527
00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:55,019
educating your bartenders and the people

1528
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:57,720
and like drawing them into feeling like

1529
00:59:55,019 --> 01:00:00,000
they're part of this family whereas like

1530
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:02,699
you know like if they're all going to

1531
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,380
any other dispensary to them you know

1532
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:06,118
unless somebody's would really tie them

1533
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:09,298
into it it's just like going to Walmart

1534
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:12,000
or a 7-Eleven you know like what what to

1535
01:00:09,298 --> 01:00:13,619
them seems like some big box company and

1536
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,480
so by doing what you're saying having a

1537
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:17,579
summer party and bringing them into the

1538
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,798
and let them know deep knowledge like

1539
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:21,119
that allows them to feel like they're a

1540
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:24,059
part of something like that you know

1541
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,140
what I mean exactly as a and not even

1542
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:27,059
just like

1543
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:28,858
with blood thinners but also consumers

1544
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:30,359
and stuff you know like the amount of

1545
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:31,920
people you bring into it will give them

1546
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:34,380
that deeper knowledge I think builds

1547
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:37,579
into like the community aspect of a web

1548
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:40,380
of resource aspect yeah

1549
01:00:37,579 --> 01:00:42,420
a lot of the consumers are going in and

1550
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:45,079
they're just like what's the highest GHC

1551
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:49,700
contact on the number of flights

1552
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:49,700
and the problem that I see is that is

1553
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,059
seriously really what you're looking for

1554
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:56,279
or you know what I mean maybe try to

1555
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:58,680
read the rest like yeah that question

1556
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,059
and this is the same conversation like

1557
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:02,699
every

1558
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:04,619
every dispensary or any we every weed

1559
01:01:02,699 --> 01:01:06,899
store is having too I think they know

1560
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:09,019
this you know I think it's like

1561
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,639
it's not that they don't they don't know

1562
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:13,980
that but

1563
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:15,420
it's just the case you know people walk

1564
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:18,298
through those doors every day and say

1565
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:19,798
what's cheap and what's the most potent

1566
01:01:18,298 --> 01:01:22,079
you know what's the best and what's the

1567
01:01:19,798 --> 01:01:24,960
cheapest

1568
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,700
and yeah yeah exactly and volume and

1569
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,760
like

1570
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:32,159
it's just that's just the way it is so

1571
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,319
yeah I think like

1572
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:37,019
in my mind I'm like I can't I can't

1573
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:39,599
fight the indoor outdoor thing forever

1574
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:41,818
so the resin show them with the resin

1575
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,380
you know show them like your outdoor Sun

1576
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:46,079
grown resin

1577
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:47,338
so fire it's like just impossible to

1578
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,318
beat

1579
01:01:47,338 --> 01:01:51,358
and uh

1580
01:01:49,318 --> 01:01:53,699
yeah show them your farm you know I

1581
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:55,679
think that's like a huge thing like show

1582
01:01:53,699 --> 01:01:58,318
them show them what you're doing like

1583
01:01:55,679 --> 01:02:01,078
it's just interesting like we nerd the

1584
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,880
fuck out on all this like this like this

1585
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:04,859
shit and like

1586
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,440
it might be self-conscious about that

1587
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:10,739
but like the bud tenders come out and

1588
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,298
they're a lot of times I mean but every

1589
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:13,558
anybody could be a bartender but there's

1590
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:15,059
a lot of like young folks that really

1591
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:16,619
want to be Growers and they want to

1592
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:18,480
learn how to like there's a lot of

1593
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:20,400
people that want to learn how to grow

1594
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,619
that start their first job as a

1595
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,260
budtender like and they're super

1596
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:26,818
fascinated and they want to like they'll

1597
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,380
just eat up the knowledge so like you're

1598
01:02:26,818 --> 01:02:31,858
giving them an opportunity and the

1599
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:34,920
access is a really big thing and like

1600
01:02:31,858 --> 01:02:36,960
yeah like I do um I do

1601
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:40,559
like vendor days sometimes I haven't

1602
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:42,480
done them that much since covid but like

1603
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,280
vendor days are cool like you set up and

1604
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,740
you just table you know somewhere like

1605

01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:52,500
like just set up a table and sell your

1635
01:03:50,818 --> 01:03:54,239
stuff or like you can't sell your stuff

1636
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,739
feeling stickers or something you know

1637
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:58,318
it's so powerful

1638
01:03:55,739 --> 01:04:00,000
like I'm always giving people seeds too

1639
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:02,219
like tomorrow I'll probably be passing

1640
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,019
out seeds and it's just the best it's

1641
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:05,098
the best way to make a connection is to

1642
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:07,440
like

1643
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:09,240
either sell or trade scenes with

1644
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:13,318
somebody like there's this like

1645
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:16,558
interaction and like if I sell you seeds

1646
01:04:13,318 --> 01:04:19,318
or give you seeds like I'm in your life

1647
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:22,200
for a minimum of like you know five

1648
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:23,639
months or four months and so there's

1649
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:26,338
just a connection there that's really

1650
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:28,879
powerful and do it you know I think

1651
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:28,880
that's a good thing

1652
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:33,019
got anything else Jerry what do we want

1653
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:33,019
to talk about

1654
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:44,339
yeah wow yeah yeah

1655
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:46,619
can you just watch your hash real quick

1656
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:49,380
yeah

1657
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:51,119
um making some hash lately uh I do a lot

1658
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:53,579
of stuff with like Royal Kush and it's

1659
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:55,740
not even like a very like good yield or

1660
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:57,539
so it's kind of special I feel like it's

1661
01:04:55,739 --> 01:04:59,818
good like decently stuff

1662
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:01,019
I made some hash I made some melt I made

1663
01:04:59,818 --> 01:05:03,298
some like

1664
01:05:01,019 --> 01:05:05,338
this year I grew a bunch of kush Kirk

1665
01:05:03,298 --> 01:05:07,139
stuff because it's just the shit

1666
01:05:05,338 --> 01:05:09,239
everybody knows like he grows good hash

1667
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:13,199
varieties and

1668
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:16,379
um I brought some EMG sour garlic it's

1669
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:18,058
like a real Sour Diesel hash it's very

1670
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,798
dang

1671
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:22,500
um we'll dab that out if anybody's

1672
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:26,239
interested and uh

1673
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,239
yeah Royal sour

1674
01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:33,139
something else

1675
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:33,139
[Music]

1676
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:42,239
yeah yeah so yeah yeah I'm a I have a

1677
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:43,980
Dem pure Farm like and uh

1678
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:46,199
yeah you gotta talk to Josh and Kelly

1679
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:49,199
you know like that's the first step is

1680
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:51,358
like talk to them and like be like I'm

1681
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:53,279
interested in this and you'll get it's

1682
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:54,900
you get plugged into like events like

1683
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,640
this

1684
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,559
um

1685
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,719
but really making your soil like making

1686
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,460
compost I think he's like the biggest

1687
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:04,279
thing you can do because it's the most

1688
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:07,500
like meaningful like

1689
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:09,298
yeah making making your own potting soil

1690
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,219
is a huge step like

1691
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:14,099
get get away from that story about

1692
01:06:11,219 --> 01:06:14,699
potting soil I think that's a good step

1693
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:17,280
um

1694
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:20,039
but just finding like cool ways to close

1695
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:22,559
loops on your own you know thing like

1696
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:24,179
you know like I know Alex here is like

1697
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:27,839
doing like a human culture bedding he's

1698
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:30,538
making his own resin and it's like

1699
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:33,480
that's like just living it being that

1700
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:36,140
that dude like this is what Chris told

1701
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:40,559
me the other day it's like

1702
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:42,179
B yeah you gotta be the guy that that's

1703
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,920
cool like you're gonna be the the guy

1704
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:45,899
you want to be and like embody that so

1705
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,818
if you want to be a

1706
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:50,400
damn tier farmer you just had to embody

1707
01:06:47,818 --> 01:06:53,099
it and build a Hugo culture start

1708
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:57,000
raising a couple animals to make your uh

1709
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:58,798
nitrogen or start closing Loops for the

1710
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,838
mushroom farm that's local to your tree

1711
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:03,960
service or something like get on a chip

1712
01:07:00,838 --> 01:07:06,239
drop whatever.com and like make your

1713
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,400
spot a drop and just start like pumping

1714
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:10,919
out soil and

1715
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,780
um just like just make regenerative

1716
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,639
cannabis you know I think that's the

1717
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:16,740
best get in contact with us like the

1718
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,358
whole damn fan like there's so many

1719
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:21,000
farmers like

1720
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:22,679
just being in contact and like asking

1721
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,880
questions that almost everybody's really

1722
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:25,858
like

1723
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,660
pretty friendly I think you know and

1724
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:30,119
like willing to

1725
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:32,279
you know engage if you're engaging I

1726
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:33,599
feel like and

1727
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,640
um

1728
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,140
but I think

1729
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:39,298
like from a very like Baseline

1730
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:42,598
perspective questioning and being

1731
01:07:39,298 --> 01:07:44,818
skeptical of the inputs we use is like

1732
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:46,798
is just super important you know like

1733
01:07:44,818 --> 01:07:48,298
you can't just trust the mushroom farm

1734
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:50,519
that it's going to be clean you might

1735
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:52,858
like need a pesticide test that that

1736
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:54,719
soil like sometimes you gotta go a

1737
01:07:52,858 --> 01:07:56,759
little extra far like I don't pesticide

1738
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:58,980
test that soil every year

1739
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,960
but I might pesticide test it next year

1740
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,298
because it's been like a year or two you

1741
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,159
know so just going the extra step and

1742
01:08:03,298 --> 01:08:06,960
like caring and knowing like kind of

1743
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:08,818
trying to be aware that there's like a

1744
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,838
level of contamination in this world

1745
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:14,579
that is almost impossible to avoid but

1746
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:16,920
that we should be striving to avoid it

1747
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:18,539
not just giving up in our Gardens like

1748
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,600
it's so easy to be like yeah there's

1749
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:24,420
glyphosate and everything

1750
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:26,940
and throw up your arms but

1751
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:29,640
I think it's just wild like there's a

1752
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:31,019
huge level of contamination so I think

1753
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,160
that's what kind of what the damn cure

1754
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:37,440
idea is just like there is contamination

1755
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:42,000
make the most holistic decisions for our

1756
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:43,500
bodies and our Gardens and uh and be

1757
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,738
very thoughtful with what we put into

1758
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:48,539
our bodies it's like it's no joke like

1759
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:50,639
you know you can't take anything back

1760
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:53,838
that you put into your body

1761
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,838
and um

1762
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:59,640
yeah is that I can answer your question

1763
01:08:57,659 --> 01:09:02,460
the best way to become a Redemption

1764
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,619
farmer or get certified

1765
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:08,719
yeah just embodying the damn pure farmer

1766
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:08,719
and then then that's how you do it

1767
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:13,199
you're mentioning chip drop and I just

1768
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:15,239
want to say it but if you are it's good

1769
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:18,059
to like let those chips sit on your

1770
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:19,858
property for like a year or so

1771
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:21,779
be really careful because all that took

1772
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:23,640
the aggregated from all over the place

1773
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:25,739
you have no idea that one truck's

1774
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:31,020
probably from like 30 different spots

1775
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:32,519
and yeah chips are yeah a gamble you're

1776
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:34,679
right yeah

1777
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,179
everything's a gamble so just recognize

1778
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:37,500
that there's a level of contamination

1779
01:09:36,179 --> 01:09:41,359
yeah

1780
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,359
make the best decisions for yourself
