1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,019
if you have a strong enough case you

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,259
don't have to go all the way through

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:10,558
trial because you can you can file some

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:14,280
earlier earlier motions and submit some

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:17,039
earlier defense that may be able to hit

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,289
to avoid going to trial or you can bring

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,000
enough evidence to show the the other

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,699
side that they're not going to win you

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,350
can file certain motions to avoid going

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,560
to trial you can get to the place that

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,109
that you can show them look guys if you

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,759
force me to the result of this is going

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,100
to be that you walk away with an invalid

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,570
patent it's going to cost us both a lot

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,189
of money but you're gonna walk with an

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:44,670
invalid patent now can any one person

17
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:46,619
endure the cost of that no the the the

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,350
the good news bad news it's a good news

19
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,659
bad news thing nobody is going to be the

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,260
target of litigation that's that

21
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:59,339
expensive unless they themselves are

22
00:00:54,259 --> 00:01:02,429
creating an economic big enough economic

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,859
target but if you create a coalition and

24
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:07,200
this that's why I'm so big on creating

25
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:10,590
we need to have a mutual defense so that

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,210
whoever is that first target has a hell

27
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,609
of a lot of support behind them and

28
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,319
that's why this this litigation that's

29
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:20,069
happening in Colorado has me troubled

30
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,500
because I I'm not involved in it myself

31
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,500
but I don't know I don't see the whole

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,859
community coming up to say no damn way

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,950
no no way is this case gonna turn out

34
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:36,478
the way it it could possibly turn out

35
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,380
this is you know this one I'm talking

36
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,569
about yet

37
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:45,618
United or true United cannabis

38
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:49,500
yeah and it's it's basically a patent

39
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:54,209
that claims any liquid formulation that

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,909
is that is no it's at least at least 95

41
00:01:54,209 --> 00:02:01,919
percent of one cannabinoid either CBD or

42
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:05,210
THC and it doesn't even have to be it

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,210
doesn't even have to be pure it just

44
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,209
yeah

45
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:19,280
it's the bare minimum for FDA standard

46
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:21,919
so 95% is like yeah and so the defendant

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,689
filed an initial motion to get the case

48
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,369
dismissed on the basis that this is a

49
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:27,770
product of nature and shouldn't be

50
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,319
patentable in the first place and that

51
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,150
was thrown out because the the the judge

52
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,549
in this case considered that that

53
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,950
purification took it beyond being a

54
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:41,360
product of nature but I I mean I think

55
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:42,708
they're gonna lose on novelty grounds

56
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,100
they've gotta lose on novelty grounds

57
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:48,050
people have been purifying things for

58
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:52,159
way before that whatever the date of

59
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:55,130
this patent right so but what I don't

60
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,870
see is a coalition of the entire

61
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,750
community standing behind this defendant

62
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,590
saying we're gonna kill this patent dead

63
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:07,270
just for the purposes of showing that

64
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,890
there's a coalition behind defendants I

65
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,810
would I would think so but maybe not I

66
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:16,399
don't know I honestly don't think we do

67
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:18,769
I don't think like there's probably only

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,409
about a couple dozen of us who know

69
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:24,500
about the case really and even those

70
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:27,620
like I know about it I've made exactly

71
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,269
zero posts about it see they're mostly

72
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,519
because like I know about it but I don't

73
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:34,039
know about it I'm not a patent lawyer I

74
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,989
don't really know what's going on to the

75
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,729
level of detail that you do when you sue

76
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:41,209
someone when you sue someone for patent

77
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:46,310
infringement if you win great you get

78
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:48,949
some damages you might also intimidate

79
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,039
everyone else into taking a license but

80
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:54,469
if you lose because of on the basis of

81
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:57,439
patent invalidity your patent is gone

82
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:59,120
you can't sue anyone again with that pet

83
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,579
for that patent at least as to the

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,840
claims that get invalidated and so it

85
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:08,469
would be if I mean and I I'm not I have

86
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,969
to have to say this carefully I'm not

87
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:13,189
expressing a legal opinion about that

88
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:16,399
patent I haven't analyzed it as a lawyer

89
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:17,870
I'm I'm I'm echoing the sentiments of

90
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,358
the community that say there's no damn

91
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,870
way okay I want to be really clear about

92
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,478
that this is

93
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:28,220
not a legal opinion but what I am saying

94
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:30,139
is that if the patent is invalid the

95
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,030
whole community ought to be standing up

96
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:35,210
to say let's invalidate that patent now

97
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:37,369
before it gets asserted against anybody

98
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:40,159
else in the community that would be a

99
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,918
community benefit with it with a capital

100
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,490
C the capital B and there ought to be a

101
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:48,829
D in there somewhere so and and that's

102
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,639
that's the that's exactly the kind of

103
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:55,698
coalition that that ought to exists yeah

104
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,400
I don't think any of us knew that we

105
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:02,090
were getting involved in an agricultural

106
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:07,129
industry that has been subsumed by an

107
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:09,049
information economy like we were we were

108
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:11,000
pop farmers and most of us were pop

109
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,100
farmers like most of the people who I

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,949
learned how to grow weed from did not

111
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:19,580
have internet connection like until the

112
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:22,310
last couple years like we were not an

113
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:24,439
information economy was not something we

114
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:30,019
had prepared ourselves for we were

115
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:31,990
worried about cops the state the cost of

116
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:35,329
coming into compliance

117
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:38,300
thieves yeah no we were not thinking in

118
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:41,478
terms of like okay how am I going to

119
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,300
secure my data what are they going our

120
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,939
they going to take my IP and leverage it

121
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,879
against me that was just not in the

122
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:53,620
vocabulary and the vernacular of a

123
00:05:49,879 --> 00:06:01,089
cannabis farmer about five months ago

124
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:01,090
six months ago yeah yeah no exactly yeah
