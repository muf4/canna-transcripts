everybody to get out in the woods and

54
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,650

64
00:03:49,509 --> 00:04:00,280
drinking last one I did not quit

65
00:03:53,949 --> 00:04:05,949

the attic and yeah there's just a big

67
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:11,889

90
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,680
[Music]

91
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:52,449
[Laughter]

92
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,970
that's one thing I said is as long as

93
00:05:52,449 --> 00:06:06,129
I'm down here getting back up some tough

94
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:09,700
part so is this like the whole Fiddler's

95
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:13,230
greens lineup dad for the tinctures for

96
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:13,229
the tanker yeah it's just attention

97
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,658
their timing is amazing

98
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:29,280
[Laughter]

99
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:32,699
alright let's let's hold off alright so

100
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:35,769
tell me about the tincture is there

101
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,930
extracted solvent lessly right there is

102
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:39,639
no extract that's right it's an infusion

103
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,098
yeah there's strange specific whole

104
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,590
flower we grow the flowers ourselves on

105
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:46,449
our farm in Sonoma County we have the

106
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,609
very first primitive farm in Sonoma

107
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:51,250
County for outdoor cultivation and we've

108
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,468
been growing the ACDC for many years and

109
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:57,639
it loves the Petaluma windgap where

110
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:59,228
we're at Panama windgap and we infuse

111
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,030
the whole flower directly into organic

112
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:04,329
olive oil so we don't use an extraction

113
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:08,500
we don't use solvents or chemicals or

114
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:10,870
isolates or reconstituted funkiness just

115
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,240
whole plant goodness in organic first

116
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:16,598
pressed virgin olive oil and we do an

117
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,848
ac/dc for our high CBD strain we AG push

118
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:20,860
for our high THC strain and then our

119
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:22,329
kindred spirit it's a balanced blend of

120
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,158
both strains so you get the full

121
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:26,500
cannabinoid and terpene profile from

122
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:29,800
both strains and then we offer these

123
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:32,439
three in both the raw form in the tan

124
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,210
boxes and that's non decarboxylated

125
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:38,348
that's the flower as it is on the plant

126
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:40,989
so it's CBD a THC a CBG a all the acidic

127
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:43,778
cannabinoids which are extremely

128
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,379
bioavailable they work amazingly well at

129
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:48,908
low dose as a whole plant and like a raw

130
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:51,849
vegetable versus a cook that's been

131
00:07:48,908 --> 00:07:54,218
actually way better for you and you need

132
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:56,528
less of it for the same efficacy exactly

133
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:58,658
and then we have the exact same three

134
00:07:56,528 --> 00:08:00,399
but these have been decarboxylated

135
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:08,468
cannabis has to be heated to get you

136
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:10,989
high Jodi found a grocery store and got

137
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:16,240
a six pack and then came back with all

138
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:19,990
this stuff too so that's amazing you're

139
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,348
gonna get shit done exactly take care of

140
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,000
the bosses

141
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:25,819

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,350

00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,529
myth is that once you go there when you

167
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,030
die it's kind of a purgatory before you

168
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:31,879
have to go to hell and us being sailors

169
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,500
we know we're going to hell and once

170
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,360
it's your time to go you fill your cup

171
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,799
up one last time from Fiddler's Green

172
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,779
and March off to the gates of hell but

173
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,339
if your cup gets empty before you reach

174
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,009
there you have to turn around and go

175
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,210
back to Fiddler's Green to refill it and

176
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:46,220
Rudyard Kipling wrote a great poem about

177
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,500
it that I believe the army cavalry they

178
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,269
you know I love it when we have the army

179
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,340
Cavett's come in because they'll come up

180
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:54,889
and recite the entire poem to us at the

181
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,019
booth all the time yeah it's it's pretty

182
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:58,279
cool and then we also named our

183
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:59,750
distribution company high-tide

184
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,419
distribution because we want to raise

185
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,399
all the ships and you know be I'm a boat

186
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:07,309
captain a sailing instructor and we just

187
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,929
had the knot of what I love is you want

188
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:11,419
to raise all ships and that was

189
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:13,309
definitely not the philosophy of all the

190
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:14,539
companies that are just imploding right

191
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:16,759
now mm-hmm

192
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:18,889
and it's like Karma's a bitch yeah

193
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,220
together we'll survive separately we're

194
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:24,529
all down you know I'd go fast we go

195
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,330
further you know and this is there's so

196
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:28,370
many people that get Sonoma County there

197
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,730
is an estimated 5,000 cultivators before

198
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:34,669
prop 64 and now there's 18 permits I

199
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,990
believe and that's not sustainable and

200
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:37,549
that's not what the communities about

201
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,180
and this is you know the people who have

202
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:41,490
been you know kept this go

203
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:44,429
the real rebels and misfits and outlaws

204
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,930
and and the people who you know had the

205
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:48,629
balls to do this when they were sending

206
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:51,629
helicopters and and jackbooted thugs and

207
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:53,669
guns after us and the bureaucrats are

208
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:55,169
ruining that and we can't stop now we've

209
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:56,939
got to keep going at them and change the

210
00:10:55,169 --> 00:11:07,709
rules and change the laws and make it so

211
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:11,480
this plants available for everybody fuck

212
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,480
these hippies were just here to make

213
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:24,149
Kennedy on that board shouldn't he be a

214
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:28,169
crow three hundred feet from my house

215
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:30,600
and my parents won't let me have friends

216
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:32,669
over and my friend's parents won't let

217
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,810
the come over because they're afraid of

218
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:42,539
the grow near my house there's drug

219
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:46,429
dealers we're hanging out with tinctures

220
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:46,429
and that smoking weed so it gets to it

221
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:54,419
okay so so for example I take the CBD

222
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:57,240
THC blend because I smoke CBD and THC

223
00:11:54,419 --> 00:12:00,089
all day I don't need those cannabinoids

224
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,680
so the raw tinctures like we were saying

225
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,210
or better for you but it's a they're

226
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,459
cannabinoids that people don't get that

227
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,990
often in their normal diets since the

228
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,000
Kemp started gross stopped growing

229
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,769
fairly the cows the pigs the chickens

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,600
don't eat anymore so we don't get as

231
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,759
part of our natural diet which we were

232
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,129
supposed to but was coffee nature was

233
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,230
made illegal so now any opportunity you

234
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:22,409
can get to get the rock in AB annoyance

235
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:26,039
he at the CBD a the THC a so confusing

236
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:28,110
at high super high CBD well so that for

237
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,909
example the ac/dc raw is a forty to one

238
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:38,909
CBD a to THC a so that is zero

239
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:40,129
yeah and these are those plays you're

240
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:46,069
killing me

241
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:48,860
you guys oh it's under this bed you're

242
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,390
going to reveal chats can't what do you

243
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,720
want to really join up

244
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:56,019
let's do the grow off but hand me my bag

245
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:00,529
behind you there it's weighs a ton

246
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:02,419
this is the the CBD a THC a balanced but

247
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:05,509
there's still no TVs personally no THC

248
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:07,699
in it this is the best one because we're

249
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:11,450
gonna see her smoke see THC we don't

250
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,460
need that so the raw version wait so

251
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:16,129
what's the ratio on this one it's

252
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,080
technically a one-to-one but very

253
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,059
different from a normal one to one where

254
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,300
that you're getting all the genetics of

255
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:24,979
ac/dc which is a forty to one CBD a THC

256
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:26,959
a and then all genetics emoji coach

257
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,779
there's a high THC a oh it's a mix

258
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,860
formulated together to make a balanced

259
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,850
version of them

260
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,120
I think it's very people have anxiety

261
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,350
but not pain or pain but no anxiety and

262
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,879
things but supporters are different some

263
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,300
people CBD a horse great I don't know

264
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:43,189
either

265
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:44,389
some people th tau or excrete it's like

266
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:51,170
a multivitamin for your endocannabinoids

267
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:54,259
the childproof so we recommend you have

268
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:56,389
5 to 10 drops to start and it could be

269
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:57,980
treated as a sublingual which if you

270
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:59,809
swirl it through your mouth for 30

271
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,550
seconds a minute or so it'll go into

272
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:03,889
your bloodstream through your cheeks and

273
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:06,079
your gums and it'll take effect within

274
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:07,639
fifteen to thirty minutes however if you

275
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,139
just swallow it straight away it acts as

276
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,360
a yellow an edible goes through your

277
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,279
digestion gets processed by your liver

278
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,310
and you know does the conversion to 11

279
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,269
hydroxy metabolites just as an ordinary

280
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:22,399
edible would wait but can can all of it

281
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:24,590
good like if I hold it in my mouth long

282
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,879
enough all of it will go through the

283
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,100
bloodstream

284
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:30,860
I'm sure the majority of it yeah most of

285
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,840
you swallow is left not swallow it's

286
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,639
mostly saliva membranes are so thin here

287
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,230
that in about 30 seconds just absorbs

288
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,699
right into your bloodstream because so

289
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,710
many of you can have it receptors in

290
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,690
your head you get relief real quickly so

291
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,040
instead of eating in an Advil or an

292
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,020
edible or a xanax that's go through your

293
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,419
stomach acid your stomach and kidney

294
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,179
deliver this just goes straight there so

295
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:51,189
you're maximizing your bioavailability

296
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:53,679
it also gives you more option to treat

297
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,000
different types of sleep deprivation so

298
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,829
one of the big questions we ask people

299
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,909
and they say I can't sleep is well do

300
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,590
you have trouble falling asleep or do

301
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:01,569
you have trouble staying asleep and it

302
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:11,050
means a big difference in how you're

303
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:14,830
gonna go at the promise fucking

304
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:16,689
exhausted yeah no problem with that but

305
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,180
if I don't have fucking huge doses of

306
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,580
THC in me when I go to bed I have insane

307
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:24,309
dreams my brain goes crazy I go to work

308
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,810
on how to use yeah the THC will keep

309
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:27,939
your brain from going too far the REM

310
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:29,319
cycle so that you still get a good

311
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,660
night's sleep but you don't remember

312
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,860
your dreams as much so if you a PTSD is

313
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:34,389
like that it's showing really great

314
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,889
effects yeah

315
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:38,409
however if you wake up in the middle of

316
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:40,360
the night and you smoke again it's gonna

317
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:42,399
kick you back into the REM cycle where

318
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,800
you're gonna have a lot of dreams right

319
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,049
or if you take too much before you go to

320
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,599
bed you wake up to pee you're fucking

321
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:50,949
tripping we're not saying this you know

322
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,080
so are we are saying this from

323
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,420
experience we we're testing out the

324
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,770
quality of certain FICO's full extract

325
00:15:55,419 --> 00:16:00,269
cannabis oils or people calm Rick

326
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:03,610
Simpson oil and so we started taking

327
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:05,559
doses every night before bed and ramping

328
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,850
that dose up every couple days to see

329
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,279
how the effects were and what would

330
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,370
happen and we skipped a few days of

331
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,439
there and ramped it up when we doubled

332
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:19,299
or tripled the boat it turns out for

333
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:21,640
grains of rice both of us woke up the

334
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:23,879
next morning tripping eight hours later

335
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,080
eight hours later

336
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:32,019
you go to bed you expect to wake up

337
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:34,650

00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:34,929
vaping hole flour instead of instead of

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:37,240
oil yeah did you feel way better I love

370
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,230
it I just flew up to the northwest and I

371
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,049
had to stop off at a few different

372
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:43,150
airports with that and I was able to fly

373
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:46,990
and hit it the whole way and so the

374
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:51,430
first thing I said to the founders was

375
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:55,480
like I saved these things just to reuse

376
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:57,400
them for ya if you guys don't make that

377
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,240
someone else is it's not very hard to

378
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,710
figure out

379
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,660
yeah fillable ceramic yeah yeah actually

380
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,069
ceramic would be cool mm-hmm yeah it

381
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,680
would be perfect or you they make the

382
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:12,789
little ceramic one-hitters you know for

383
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:16,450
the dugouts those are nice Richard is

384
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:18,819
sending me a prototype no shit oh man I

385
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,039
love the old they could make a fortune

386
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:23,079
just selling the pokers because I think

387
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,680
anybody has ever owned a prototype has

388
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:28,119
bent or lost the poker on those things

389
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,039
that was the first pipe I ever smoked

390
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:33,429
out of when I was like in sixth grade

391
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:36,069
really was my so I'm the youngest for

392
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:40,210
the next brother is four years older and

393
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:42,309
so like he used to have a fake drawer

394
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,059
and that's where his weed was and when I

395
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:45,059
discovered it

396
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,820
your studies interaction with this thing

397
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,279
people love it yeah I guess such a

398
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:11,329
simply doing the packaging is crazy bout

399
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:13,099
them recyclable yes because I think the

400
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:15,500
whole lines consistent packaging right

401
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:18,139
like if someone else created a product

402
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,119
they'd have to use this yes well they're

403
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,830
sourcing from a lot of great farms we're

404
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,808
providing flour for several of their

405
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:26,259
SKUs and then we're also helping them

406
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:28,819
find flour from other good farms and

407
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:30,829
we're trying to keep the farm intact all

408
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:32,569
the way through the process so that you

409
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,879
know the end consumer knows where the

410
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:37,609
flour has grown what region who did it

411
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,610
what's the terroir so by the way people

412
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:46,459
were making fun of us for hanging out

413
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:48,558
with a Tish tinker is an hour thousand

414
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,850
different ways to have cannabis yeah so

415
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,250
you get three minutes on it

416
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:55,339
I usually Howard this thing so it counts

417
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:58,660
down you bought 15 hits ah but before

418
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,659
you yeah

419
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:12,910
got a great two kids fucking mark I gave

420
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:16,120
him three packs and I love you sure he

421
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,798
didn't got freaking nine bags wrote all

422
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:20,469
but Sanders names on him and then pull

423
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:23,139
one and then wrote on each stick what it

424
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,789
was and then post looking three of them

425
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:31,960
in each bag nice I was like wow man

426
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:35,470
that's fucking all right so sticking

427
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:42,669
with packaging is this good enough where

428
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:46,480
you fuckers if you need to feed him

429
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:48,220
lines you can but uh but like what was

430
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,130
kind of like one of you guys were

431
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,870
looking for a source in packaging form

432
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,030
factors and providers what were you

433
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:57,459
looking for it's a really tough thing

434
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:59,529
because the the packaging and compliance

435
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,960
laws are so difficult you've got to have

436
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:04,029
all of this room for everything that

437
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,240
they require on their from you know the

438
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:09,308
California cannabis symbol to your lab

439
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,990
testing you got to have tamper evidence

440
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:14,230
seals you got to have child resistant

441
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:21,519
packaging prop 65 the prop 65 everything

442
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:23,200
causes cancer what six times the last

443
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,410
three years yeah we have to keep

444
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,150
changing or using as this glass yeah so

445
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:30,160
I mean that's like a consciousness I

446
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,350
mean it's more expensive than plastic so

447
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,169
absolutely so can you talk about those

448
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:37,719
decisions like one guy just want to be

449
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:39,370
environmentally conscious and absolutely

450
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,679
and well the regulations make it very

451
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:43,719
difficult well and that most everything

452
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,390
with that's affordable within the price

453
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,769
range is all coming from China and of

454
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,690
course right now we've got the

455
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:50,980
coronavirus and we've got whole

456
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,110
provinces being shut down and we're just

457
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,000
coming off of Chinese New Year and if

458
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:57,308
you don't order around Chinese New Year

459
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,230
and so we've been really putting in a

460
00:22:57,308 --> 00:23:01,960
lot of effort to find locally sourced

461
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,329
sustainable small family businesses who

462
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,669
are putting on this all together so use

463
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:11,970
China like not being able to live

464
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:14,100
as another reason oh yeah it was like

465
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:16,079
American whatever like packaging

466
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:18,719
providers and then be able to tell that

467
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,398
story it's it's a real challenge

468
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,528
especially for people that are in the

469
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:24,808
cannabis industry that start out as

470
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:26,940
farmers and then as the cultivator and

471
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:29,879
they're used to having to do everything

472
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,440
from your seed stock your clone stock to

473
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,570
amending your soil you're developing

474
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,330
your hydro or developing your your

475
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:38,009
indoor system to growing the plants all

476
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:40,349
the way through the system being the the

477
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:42,058
horticulturist and then you would do

478
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:43,379
your own curing what you'd have to build

479
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:45,418
out in another room so you got to have

480
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,700
carpentry and electrical skills or

481
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,559
somebody that does that for you and then

482
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,690
you do your trimming or you bring in a

483
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:54,269
trim crew and then you sell it and get

484
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,440
your money and now the people that that

485
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:57,569
was the whole industry and you've

486
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,080
controlled it from end to end now we've

487
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:02,519
got marketing and packaging and

488
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,439
compliance you have to have a whole team

489
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:06,419
of people that specialize in every

490
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,519
little thing because when you go into a

491
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,440
dispensary with a product now the

492
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,808
compliance officers are back there with

493
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:16,139
a microscope and they're going over

494
00:24:12,808 --> 00:24:18,240
every letter of a bat shop they open

495
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:20,009
every box and if things don't match up

496
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,769
things aren't right they are obligated

497
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:25,349
under the regulations to reject it and

498
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:27,028
send it back which jams up the whole

499
00:24:25,349 --> 00:24:28,949
system and so this is where a lot of the

500
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:30,359
extra cost is coming and then the legal

501
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,269
market is we're all having to jump

502
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:35,428
through hoops to package repackage

503
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:37,440
unstick Arista Kerr change the size

504
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:39,298
we've even seen where the purchasers had

505
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,190
a ruler measuring the size of the

506
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:42,990
California cannabis symbol because

507
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,519
there's specs on that and if you just

508
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,440
make a photocopy sticker and put it on

509
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:49,288
there it might be just a smidge off but

510
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,288
it's out of compliance and because

511
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:53,609
everything's so complicated now

512
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:57,210
everyone's following the rules but

513
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:59,490
slightly different variations of 1264

514
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,630
they joke about it being like the Bible

515
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,370
where it's a great story being

516
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,130
interpreted in a hundred different ways

517
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:06,928
which is crazy gonna be n/a we have all

518
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,390
sorts of different places they require

519
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:10,679
different things of us you know this

520
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,299
place you can't do this this way you

521
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:17,970
can't do that that's kind of that I view

522
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:20,819
all the religions it's like Judaism to

523
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,250
Christianity to Islam like they all

524
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:25,168
believe the same starting stuff and then

525
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,839
it's like Christianity is like no there

526
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:29,909
is this next dude called Jesus and then

527
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,230
Muslims are like no no no no we agree

528
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:33,000
there with Jesus but then there was

529
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,028
another dude after him named Mohammed

530
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:44,788
but they all agree with everything

531
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:51,140
before and they're really virgin I gave

532
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:53,669
up religion for Lent again alright so

533
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:57,659
because you also have the pre-rolls and

534
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:59,278
then you have the human bomb with it we

535
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:01,890
have a healing balm as well that we use

536
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,470
the Ross sit at kindred spirit and we

537
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,630
named it kindred spirit because THC and

538
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,669
CBD are spirit molecules or sister

539
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,559
molecules they take care of each other

540
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:12,059
they boost each other up they temper

541
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,269
each other out they make each other work

542
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:17,278
better together and that's also the name

543
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:18,599
of the sailboat that Shen and I rebuilt

544
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,519
and lived on for a while as kindred

545
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,019
spirits so we like to tie it back in and

546
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,089
that's another thing with your packaging

547
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:28,918
make some make it mean something no just

548
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:30,298
listen you guys say you lived and you

549
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,070
guys knew each other from what Island

550
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:34,168
from st. Croix in the Virgin Islands you

551
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:42,148
over 20 years ago there I was there

552
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:45,809
about ten years and you yeah yep we live

553
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:50,599
together from 2001 to 2004 yeah I think

554
00:26:45,808 --> 00:26:50,599
2004 by the way it's Celtics double over

555
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:58,658
I thought football was over I was quite

556
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:02,589
a walked into bricks hidden those and

557
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:04,059
they had a plan and we started out

558
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:06,250
making pot icecream in the Virgin

559
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:08,079
Islands over 20 years ago and we would

560
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,548
make pot brownie ice cream sandwiches

561
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,109
and wrap them in foil and we had a

562
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:13,359
sticker on him red beards nice creams

563
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:15,599
and we had a little mobile ice cream

564
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:18,250
cart pushed it on out of the boardwalk

565
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,658
but so we paid bills in fact for Shannon

566
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:23,099
and I our first date I was selling pot

567
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:37,510
brownies out of the backpack at the

568
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:39,879
locals at that time we have and really

569
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:41,919
well but it's 12 and 12 year round so

570
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,870
you know your veg cycle is a little bit

571
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,429
different and then curing you know you

572
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:48,189
have a lot of humidity that's why a lot

573
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:50,798
of the Caribbean flour has that golden

574
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:53,409
or brown color especially humid areas

575
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,879
because they're curing it in places are

576
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:58,149
drying it in places where they don't

577
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,860
have AC or or humidity controls so

578
00:27:58,148 --> 00:28:01,418
they're generally doing it just blocked

579
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:06,339
from the shade with as much air flow as

580
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:07,419
possible so it doesn't rot but the

581
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:09,129
Caribbean and that you know the

582
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:11,528
equatorial places you know there's some

583
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:14,440
great land race trains that are gonna

584
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:16,509
start popping back up again and it'll be

585
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,450
interesting to see because if you can

586
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:22,419
green house and light depth and get your

587
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,610
your plant sized up you could do some

588
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:25,899
really big full season turns in the cab

589
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:28,240
game they're gonna have to do mix light

590
00:28:25,898 --> 00:28:31,298
way around cuz I said good twelve twelve

591
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,859
the whole time and he can't do an indoor

592
00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:34,298
grow because the electricity is so

593
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:35,829
unreliable down there you'd have to have

594
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:37,720
a generator almost running for what you

595
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:38,980
eat is like what zelich has like you did

596
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,929
the other day Peter where you need a

597
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,179
glass greenhouse with Nick's white

598
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:45,669
inside you can do a combination of those

599
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:48,700
things and solar solar and led to reduce

600
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:50,080
you know your electrical and also

601
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,519
reduces the heat in there because you

602
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,648
know the Caribbean so hot already and

603
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,829
it's so humid you got to grow some

604
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,819
really strains that are mold and mildew

605
00:28:56,829 --> 00:28:59,669
resistant

606
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:15,089
he's a good candidate down the road

607
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:16,860
and if I can uh uncle Sal so are there I

608
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:18,480
need genetics that you took from there

609
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:23,339
that you grew up in Sonoma

610
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,559
there was but we had a partner who has

611
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:26,939
them but yeah that's one of those things

612
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:29,039
if you're in the industry at all you're

613
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,700
gonna have you're gonna Ryan run into

614
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,349
some safety people and so we've lost a

615
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,120
lot of our genetics over the years and

616
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:38,009
we found new ones and then we have like

617
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:39,509
our Durbin it's burned grown in our

618
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:42,059
family of cultivators for over 20 years

619
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:44,039
and so it's a family thing so whoever

620
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:45,419
needs cut somebody always has cuts and

621
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:49,769
we've always just shared and helped each

622
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:52,920
other out that was grown in the Virgin

623
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:57,690
Islands to for a little while the turban

624
00:29:52,920 --> 00:30:00,320
that you guys now have up and yeah some

625
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:08,330
cuts made their way to st. Croix

626
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:12,299
allegedly growing up in Sonoma like

627
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:16,349
progeny of what was growing in st. Croix

628
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:19,680
it came from Sonoma County to st. Croix

629
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:21,719
I believe they're out yeah there's

630
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,340
cousins there's a lot of people that

631
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,259
have this and have shared it out within

632
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:28,740
the screen as I was my question was

633
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:31,019
gonna be did these South African

634
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,970
genetics acclimate themselves to st.

635
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:35,430
Croix and then we're then moved like

636
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,539
like kids like like army brats moving

637
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,100
around the world were their parents or

638
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:41,430
something being like I totally new

639
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:43,500
climate I don't think so not so much I

640
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:46,470
mean if you keep cloning the same mother

641
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,779
in that location yeah you're gonna start

642
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,730
seeing that changed but I think if you

643
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:53,369
just take a cut to in a new environment

644
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,900
it's not gonna have that memory to do

645
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:57,509
the next generation if it's moved

646
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:01,650
immediately now I always think about

647
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:03,849
plants that like grew up and just

648
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:06,970
perfect weather environments and then

649
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:09,219
suddenly like they're moved to like a

650
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,769
much harsher environment well that's a

651
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:15,100
sin that's one of the theories on why it

652
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:18,279
produces cannabinoids that the Indus

653
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:21,339
Valley where it was in those areas when

654
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:23,710
the plates shifted and the Himalayas

655
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:26,649
were formed it was forced from more of a

656
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,630
sea level up into a higher elevation and

657
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,809
it forced the plant to produce the

658
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:34,750
cannabinoids and in the resin glands -

659
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:36,158
as a UV protection on the plant and so

660
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,720
they believed that drastic change in

661
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,220
elevation during its development was one

662
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,740
of the causes for the production of

663
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,529
cannabinoids so were those tectonic

664
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:48,659
movements like in a couple of days or

665
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:56,319
ever like millions of no idea about that

666
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:59,130
like a gentle acclamation of like gentle

667
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,599
earth 20 million years right no yeah

668
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:05,190
that would be it would CalPERS like how

669
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,189
long did mountain this take to four

670
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:21,820
[Laughter]

671
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:36,730
where's where's your young Jaime to pull

672
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:39,819
up over here have my car here that's the

673
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:46,419
only reasons restraints these clouds

674
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:47,879
have seen the best lowers to me or

675
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:50,850
sometimes led the way

676
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,920
[Music]

677
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:57,599
or Tuesday night when I drove home from

678
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:59,759
here I was like super high and my

679
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,819
contacts were like dry and glued to my

680
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:15,390
eyes and it was just like stress

681
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:16,409
miserable problem for me there talk

682
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,000
about the package you got to make your

683
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:21,150
package thing mean something just don't

684
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,250
go to a marketer and say this color

685
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:25,410
pattern and this is the logo that's

686
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:27,450
going to be an eye-catcher of this

687
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,700
season's go look at the dispensary

688
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,519
shelves there is it all looks like the

689
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:35,610
same company design happen there's no

690
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:37,529
personality big part is just nothing

691
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:40,829
like this has no personality and I like

692
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:48,990
that no it's fun mm-hmm yeah that we got

693
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:50,699
a little Cresco it's very clean

694
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,410
everything's very crisp I get it

695
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,940
but it doesn't show your personally

696
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,950
really 11 people in this company no

697
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,600
we're still a family run business so

698
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,890
it's important for us to have our social

699
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:05,839
so how many people came from st. Croix

700
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:08,280
to work cuz you what once was five of us

701
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:10,920
well there's a lot and a lot of people

702
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,510
you know we've gotten from California

703
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:16,099
and wound up in the Virgin Islands and

704
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:18,350
came back and and it's just if you drove

705
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:20,969
California Washington Oregon and Idaho

706
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:26,339
like we're in California I was born in

707
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:29,429
San Diego okay oh yeah sure we've lived

708
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:31,890
in Tahoe Marina del Rey

709
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:33,750
then we Juneau Alaska I've earned some

710
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:37,500
seat I'm working out of Juneau Alaska

711
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:41,159
Vancouver British Columbia Lake Tahoe LA

712
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,929
San Diego Ensenada I wouldn't know I was

713
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,179
a professional captain at the time and

714
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:48,679
couldn't touch anything unfortunately

715
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:50,569
from what other people's

716
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,799
it was crippling it was some really nice

717
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,180
stuff because some of them some of the

718
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,580
first strains I ever got to smoke were

719
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:58,879
from Alaska and like Alaska Thunder fuck

720
00:34:55,579 --> 00:35:04,460
in Northern Lights and this is all grown

721
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:07,220
indoors yeah you know what I was saying

722
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:10,300
about like like let's say you're some

723
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:13,119
happy land race and some chilled

724
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:17,630
Mediterranean environment and then like

725
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:20,960
the next seed pops and it's in like a

726
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,760
shitty indoor grow like not a good one

727
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,740
but I get terrible one you're just like

728
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,140
I don't know sometimes this dress makes

729
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:28,819
the plant perform better yeah like our

730
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:31,009
ac/dc if you give it a perfect

731
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,960
environment and an indoor grow with all

732
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,640
the right nutrients and happy soil and

733
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,740
perfect light and temperature and

734
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:42,159
humidity it looks like an octopus on

735
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:49,989
quaaludes yeah it just kind of lays down

736
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:49,989
I don't know oh he fell out of my paw

737
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,259
and then also production of cannabinoids

738
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,260
and terpenoids

739
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:02,600
defense of the plant so the heavy wind

740
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:10,389
or predation or bugs strengthen and

741
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:10,389
build the plant up no we go out and

742
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:16,099
that's what I'm miss doing that and

743
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:18,739
there's yeah

744
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:20,509
I started making edibles and cultivating

745
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:22,219
and you know now being in the business

746
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,010
of cannabis I haven't touched a plant in

747
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:27,139
years you know would love my cultivation

748
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:30,730
team to death but I wish I was with them

749
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:34,940
everyday instead of you know outside

750
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:36,349
this isn't too bad but yes but all the

751
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:39,019
hoops we have to jump through instead of

752
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:40,699
just being cannabis people you know it's

753
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:43,369
it's the most regulated market in the

754
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:46,599
world and it's led by the misinformed

755
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:46,599
and yeah

756
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:59,319
yeah this is my favorite one I use this

757
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:01,900
one every day because we as we smoke we

758
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,150
get a lot of decarboxylated cannabis in

759
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,889
our diets and so the acidic cannabinoids

760
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:12,910
especially the balanced ratio of the

761
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:16,569
kindred spirit mm-hmm and so that

762
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:18,279
balance is the balance out all your

763
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,840
other major systems so you've got your

764
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,490
mood you're paying your appetite it's

765
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,440
all balanced out by your endocannabinoid

766
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:27,189
system and the kindred spirit is

767
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,159
actually ac/dc and og cush so you're

768
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,929
getting twice the genetics working

769
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,549
together not just a one-to-one strain

770
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:35,019
mm-hmm so you're maximizing the

771
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,269
combination of cannabinoids in Turkey

772
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:38,739
there ain't no cannabinoid system which

773
00:37:37,269 --> 00:37:40,119
in turn is maximizing the balance the

774
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:44,649
rest your systems are you guys gonna

775
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:47,049
make a hash weave yes we've we used to

776
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:49,869
make bubble hash but you know the old

777
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:53,140
backyard style with the trashcan and the

778
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:56,949
bubble bags and yeah that's in the works

779
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:58,989
now our manufacturing site is getting up

780
00:37:56,949 --> 00:38:04,329
and going and we're starting to back can

781
00:37:58,989 --> 00:38:06,759
that be on site yeah oh no no we have a

782
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:08,230
manufacturing facility for that so we

783
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,750
have cultivation manufacturing and

784
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:12,039
distribution we had to do that and keep

785
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,320
ourselves whole through the market

786
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,820
because it's you know we couldn't find

787
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,140
anybody to represent us the way that we

788
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,210
wanted to be where's how are you doing

789
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:21,699
fresh frozen are you like drying and

790
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,960
curing and then using that no we use we

791
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:25,119
believe in the Cure and it actually

792
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,980
helps retain the acidic cannabinoids

793
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,989
that and the olive oil

794
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,190
long slow cure is one of the most

795
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:31,539
important parts of the plant you can

796
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,250
grow the best cannabis in the world and

797
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:35,079
if you don't cure it it's gonna smell

798
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,300
like a and tastes horrible and smoke

799
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,889
horrible and you know why go through the

800
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,680
but you got an aged wine you know you

801
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:43,539
got to let it ripen and you accidentally

802
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:48,309
and you got to let the cannabinoids and

803
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:50,079
terpenoids to cannabis the market but

804
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:52,150
when you're making medicine it's

805
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,429
important to let it cure properly so it

806
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,200
settles into a song

807
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:58,460
the right cannabinoids in Turpan choice

808
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:02,009
people who talk about fresh frozen for

809
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:05,400
Hashmi and talk about like freezing the

810
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:07,800
maximum essence of that plant just as

811
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,300
it's harvest absolutely that's a one way

812
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,579
to go and I love it it's very fresh and

813
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:17,039
and bright tasting but I believe in the

814
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,720
old temple ball making hash you know I

815
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,029
love listening to Frenchy can only talk

816
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:24,959
about it he likes older cured flour to

817
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:26,280
make his hash with as well what are your

818
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:43,050
thoughts what are your thoughts and what

819
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:44,490
we're seeing right here you know I'm new

820
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,410
to the concentrate world I've been a

821
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:51,118
flower guy my whole life clearly the

822
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:54,588
bong is my best run and but they've

823
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,500
enjoyed trying two different versions of

824
00:39:54,588 --> 00:40:01,460
concentrates and so this is uh George

825
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,460
green thumb

826
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:24,039
that's also oh yeah that's why they have

827
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:30,170
the illegal grab bars down by this

828
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:34,660
allegedly one gene C code reading this

829
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,659
right yeah all guns are a legend

830
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:42,599
that's one of the craziest things about

831
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,670
the industry now is for so many years

832
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,259
you know you didn't tell anybody your

833
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,849
real name you didn't loan them let them

834
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,370
know what you're doing you never let

835
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:52,949
anybody come over to your house or talk

836
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:57,079
about what you did or how you did it it

837
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:57,079
wasn't that long ago I know

838
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:28,239
[Laughter]

839
00:41:46,099 --> 00:42:02,788
[Laughter]

840
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:02,788
No all right there's two on the bottom

841
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:19,630
all right I assume it's glass there's

842
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,130
pineapple Thai over there from all right

843
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:24,130
so yeah what are these two

844
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:26,789
all right so we think that caramel cream

845
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:29,470
was the grow off flowers of this year

846
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:31,059
and then the other was the pineapple

847
00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:34,088
Thai I thought there were three on the

848
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:38,069
table before no just just to either

849
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:38,068
durbin did your server yeah

850
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:52,910
the pilot I finally smell like pineapple

851
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:54,530
this year's they say we press it up now

852
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:58,250
because of the regulations we couldn't

853
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:59,960
grow these in our permitted space we had

854
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:07,489
to do this in our personal garden off to

855
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:08,510
the side man like I said I wish I could

856
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:10,339
be out there every day that was one

857
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:12,860
thing all the other plants know they're

858
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:20,539
your favorite yeah they're a little

859
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:23,870
isolated down there actually yeah well

860
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:26,599
in the year we wanted to grow off we we

861
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:28,880
really let the plants just go for their

862
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:31,329
own we had a end none of the Hugo

863
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,849
culture yeah we did it in the Hyuga beds

864
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:37,610
and it was turned into a challenging

865
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:39,380
season we helped another farm that was

866
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:42,349
having issues we help them through their

867
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:44,780
harvest and just didn't have time to

868
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:47,569
give to the grow off plants and they

869
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:50,570
just took off and ran and loved where

870
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:53,690
they were we took first place for

871
00:43:50,570 --> 00:44:10,070
potency with with that year and third

872
00:43:53,690 --> 00:44:12,980
place for terpenes yeah so you own a

873
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:15,380
distribution company sue yeah we have

874
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:18,469
the farm we have manufacturing and

875
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:20,960
distribution but it's all out of form

876
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:23,750
and function because we could we made

877
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,159
all of our own products before but we

878
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:27,619
couldn't find anybody who could do the

879
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:29,029
way we wanted it done and then the same

880
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:31,039
with the distribution when you know

881
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,930
we've been growing CBD strains for seven

882
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,429
years now back before anybody really

883
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:37,879
knew what it was we got our original

884
00:44:34,429 --> 00:44:41,989
seeds from lawrence ringo and that was

885
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,130
for us our tsunami and been working with

886
00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:45,349
it for quite a while and when you walk

887
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:47,059
in with flour to somebody and say hey i

888
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,380
grew this beautiful flower but it won't

889
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,400
get you high you know they were

890
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,349
originally they call it the hippies

891
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,670
disappointment because they grew these

892
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:53,460
great-looking flowers and then smoked

893
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,960
them and they didn't

894
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,480
but they noticed how much better they

895
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,829
felt after they smoked it and he's

896
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,838
always saying why didn't get us high but

897
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:03,210
it was a much better feeling they have a

898
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:04,980
better balance the CBD and THC back then

899
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,690
mm-hmm and that's what Lawrence Ringo

900
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,849
was noticing because he had back issues

901
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:10,500
and he knows he was able to to do more

902
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:13,710
things and so they started working more

903
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:17,969
on breeding the CBD strains if you

904
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:20,760
smoked like eight joints of super high

905
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:24,568
CBD would you eventually just get super

906
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,740
at like with the THC catch-up no it

907
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:30,690
would be like trying to get drunk off of

908
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:33,149
non-alcoholic beer alcohol exactly so by

909
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,650
the time you got to the 30th one you

910
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,539
would be out of your system from already

911
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:40,019
before that but if you did it within

912
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:41,639
like an hour good question there's no

913
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:43,230
way well we've also done good day

914
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:48,108
because if you drank this whole ball you

915
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:56,429
wouldn't get high have you ever tried it

916
00:45:48,108 --> 00:45:58,679
we've taken quite a bit of it what CBD

917
00:45:56,429 --> 00:46:02,759
does is it changes the way that THC

918
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:05,129
binds to the cb1 receptor and it lowers

919
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,349
the threat of how high you're gonna get

920
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,088
with the THC but it makes it last longer

921
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:10,920
because it slows down the reuptake and

922
00:46:09,088 --> 00:46:12,509
Road transmitters and so you're gonna

923
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,980
find that balance that's why a kindred

924
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:16,260
spirit with the balance of the two at

925
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,849
the CBD and the THC but what's your bet

926
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,920
do you think of Jodie drank that whole

927
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:24,170
bottle he would get higher or not no I

928
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,170
don't think so we've taken a lot of that

929
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:35,460
[Laughter]

930
00:46:32,298 --> 00:46:37,079
CBD is also can be very focusing like

931
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,179
you know almost an adderall where you

932
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:43,609
just want to sit down and do things you

933
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:51,690
could drink a small bottle of the OG and

934
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:53,909
that was yeah that's 300 milligrams it's

935
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:57,210
all THC well there's there's just a

936
00:46:53,909 --> 00:47:00,058
minimal it's the exact same thing as

937
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:01,530
this but this is not decarboxylated

938
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:04,530
cannabis has to be heated to get you

939
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:06,150
high and so this is THC a this is the

940
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,550
exact same plant probably came from the

941
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,160
exact

942
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:10,810
same branch except this the cannabis was

943
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,379
heated and decarboxylated before Oh in

944
00:47:10,809 --> 00:47:13,239
the olive oil

945
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,550
and this is the raw natural plant the

946
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:17,469
way it is in the garden so if you think

947
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:19,380
if you think dressing so each of those

948
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:23,319
went through a different process yeah

949
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:31,809
flower this one was in the oven fern for

950
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:36,460
a period of time a couple round number

951
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:38,170
now so ever so like we try to be so open

952
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,300
and transparent about everything we do

953
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:43,590
and then we realize you know some things

954
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,590
we have to keep really know

955
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:48,519
and we're just open people so it's it's

956
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,709
tough for us to like you know go oh well

957
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:53,320
this is what happens and this is how we

958
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:56,230
do this and we just love talking about

959
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:58,720
it it's so much fun but this one you

960
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:04,690
know this is THC a is amazing for aches

961
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:06,909
pains its scrapes exactly arthritic dog

962
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,950
you're a threaded gram the info

963
00:48:06,909 --> 00:48:10,179
anti-inflammatory anyway a car two

964
00:48:08,949 --> 00:48:13,839
months ago when I use that as my

965
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:16,960
anti-inflammatory yep I use this after

966
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,610
doing a long demo because your feet just

967
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,710
getting all nasty but it's it's great

968
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:22,269
but they won't snot psychoactive so if

969
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:24,730
you have the day job you have to work

970
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:26,860
with kids and you need THC for the pain

971
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:28,750
relief you can do THC a without the

972
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,610
secular activity now this one is the

973
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:32,860
exact same flower this one will get you

974
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:35,800
a high as a giraffe's ass because it's

975
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,809
been decarboxylated and heated but now

976
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,510
you don't need the third glass of wine

977
00:48:37,809 --> 00:48:41,769
the ambien the painkiller at the end of

978

00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:03,670
patient education just because we make

985
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:05,349
when you make five products that will

986
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:08,159
get people high education means

987
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:08,159

his passion to sell that okay well we

989
00:49:21,568 --> 00:49:27,449
have to learn to talk about this so we

990
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:28,618
go and sit and work oh yeah if they

991
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:30,389
don't come up to the booth we're gonna

992
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:32,220
bring them up to the booth does your

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,309
anxious or as arthritis is your Kindle

996
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:46,019
an adderall I can help you even if it's

997
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:48,450
not for you - it's like a sublingual

998
00:49:46,018 --> 00:49:56,459
edible I promise I travel it just take

999
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:58,139
the label off but we really had to dive

1000
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,210
into the education to be able to explain

1001
00:49:58,139 --> 00:50:01,348
this to purchasers who explained it's

1002
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:03,720
the blood tenders who explained it to

1003
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:05,430
the patients and so we try to educate at

1004
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:07,500
all the levels and so we go and listen

1005
00:50:05,429 --> 00:50:09,690
to the people who do the research the

1006
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,849
doctors and the clinicians we go and sit

1007
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:15,358
in their continuing education classes we

1008
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:16,890
go to medical conferences we've had to

1009
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:18,719
go to learn everything about the

1010
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:21,900
endocannabinoid system and cannabis

1011
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:23,098
dosing and and learn about the support

1012
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,440
groups and all the people that are

1013
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:28,890
actually putting this to practice every

1014
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,289
day as a medicine as you know a healing

1015
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:32,759
tool and so we're trying to raise this

1016
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:35,099
you know they didn't go to college for

1017
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:44,338
making a prescribing medicine for babies

1018
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:48,150

1019
00:50:44,338 --> 00:51:01,349

again oh there we go yes a hash bowl is

1040
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:39,690
ease these guys yeah it's one so the

1041
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:41,579
yeah the back the bat on the side is a

1042
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:43,108
lot like so it doesn't just

1043
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:45,599
automatically side you have to pull the

1044
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:54,869
bat down with your thumb to say get this

1045
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:57,869
to slide yeah it's like child yeah pull

1046
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:59,068
that down and then slide the lid and I

1047
00:52:57,869 --> 00:53:00,930
always love I've been carrying one of

1048
00:52:59,068 --> 00:53:03,480
these for over 20 years with me that's

1049
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:04,889
one of the best things ever you know to

1050
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,139
have with you but the problem is when

1051
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:08,879
you're with a group of people it's a

1052
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:10,259
bummer to sit there and have to pack one

1053
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:14,720
for each person and knock the ball out

1054
00:53:10,259 --> 00:53:18,380
and it's relatively clean uh yeah

1055
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:20,959
there sure is it's a it's a nice mix

1056
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,820
salad I used to like those things

1057
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,190
because I would rather people thought

1058
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,230
that I was smoking pot and smoking a

1059
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:28,700
cigarette and so it's always frustrating

1060
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:31,010
you're like I saw you smoking a

1061
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:33,309
cigarette now it was I love that is I

1062
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,310
love it

1063
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:39,639
me too and there's so much fun I

1064
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,640
remember being in a bar and Billy Bob's

1065
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:49,098
seeing Willie Nelson at Billy Bob's

1066
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:50,598
and having this in my pocket and we were

1067
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:53,269
standing a couple people behind the

1068
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:55,340
bouncers and you could still smoke

1069
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:57,530
cigarettes and bars back then so I took

1070
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,910
that thing took a big puff blunt in the

1071
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:00,380
back of the bouncers head put it back in

1072
00:53:58,909 --> 00:54:02,239
my pocket and stand there like nothing

1073
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:04,099
happened watch them run around trying to

1074
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,149
find out who is smoking pot and then

1075
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:15,289
wait till they settle down and then do

1076
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:18,440
it again so what was in here it's a

1077
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:20,900
mixed salad it's a little a little

1078

1088
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:50,739
growing that isn't making it to market

1089
00:54:56,108 --> 00:55:01,489
yeah the pineapple type the skittles

1090
00:54:58,579 --> 00:55:07,039
yeah we did some co2 caramilk the Carol

1091
00:55:01,489 --> 00:55:09,829
cream yeah that's the stuff thing is you

1092
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:11,929
have to make so the most use you can out

1093
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:14,269
of your permitted space and that only

1094
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:16,159
leaves you your six personal plants

1095
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:19,030
outside of that to do R&amp;D or personal

1096
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:22,129
stuff and it's nice because for our farm

1097
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:23,450
we grow a bunch of all of our six plants

1098
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:25,910
and then it's going to be divided among

1099
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:27,348
the staff so you know we all get to

1100
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,819
share this is the first time we've

1101
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:29,920

been in our tinctures there's so much of

1106
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:46,599
it yeah we had since it was such an

1107
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:50,730
awesome representation 30 to 1 CBD to

1108
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:53,559
teeth straight out of the garden so we

1109
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:55,329
so we uh we finally took me on the best

1110
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:57,429
of the best the top of the tops and

1111
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:59,590
threw them into jars and when you spoke

1112
00:55:57,429 --> 00:56:03,190
this ac/dc it's amazing it's just so

1113
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:04,809
calming and relaxing imagine without me

1114
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:06,909
the cycle activity that's how you know

1115
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:09,159
you can smoking zbc all day it not get

1116
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:14,440
high but you feel fucking great

1117
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:15,519
yeah as I like to say that CBD does have

1118
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,460
psycho activity but it's

1119
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:23,289
non-intoxicating believe that the

1120
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:26,440
burning end up yeah because because it

1121
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:29,170
it's calming it's anti-anxiety it makes

1122
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,269
you feel better it focuses you it quiets

1123
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:37,200
the circus running between your ears it

1124
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:37,199
allows you to you know to have that yeah

1125
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:44,619
[Laughter]

1126
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:47,770
on that one Ebola if you look at it it's

1127
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:50,889
we're talk about how you have to pack

1128
00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:58,360
one for everybody pull the the bat out

1129
00:56:50,889 --> 00:57:02,259
and then close that back up and then

1130
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:04,510
look on the side there you go that's a

1131
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,880
bowl and now if you stick the bat into

1132
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:09,040
the small hole on the side where your

1133
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,500
thumb is yeah there you go

1134
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:14,070
now it turns into a bowl so you can pass

1135
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:18,010
it around or no you still draw from the

1136
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:20,320
turn wait you still draw from there but
