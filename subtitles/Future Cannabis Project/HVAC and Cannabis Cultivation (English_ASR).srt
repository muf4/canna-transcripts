00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:13,519
I robbed Addison with inspire hi I'm Sam

3
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:16,039
burger and crop scientists I'm Nadia

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,899
Saba the president of dr. greenhouse all

5
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,000
right let's talk HVAC that's awesome

6
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:21,259
yeah so I got into this business about

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,028
eight years ago just kind of stumbled

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,929
into it and then for the last three

9
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:28,399
years I've been doing HVAC for

10
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:33,140
agriculture typically indoor some

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:36,018
greenhouse and it's been a race to

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,030
understand the plant science along with

13
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:41,359
the HVAC challenges that go along with

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,698
it you know you start by using

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,798
commercial equipment and stubbing your

16
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:48,259
toe again and again and again and not

17
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:49,728
really understanding why the plants

18
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:52,548
aren't yielding what they're supposed to

19
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:55,969
and thinking maybe we shouldn't be

20
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:57,320
slapping a leaf weed leaf sticker on the

21
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:00,439
side of a commercial air conditioning

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,030
unit right and so that led us to develop

23
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:03,439
you know better products use

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,368
tried-and-true dehumidification

25
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:10,090
technologies and you know start really

26
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:12,859
reading the papers and the latest

27
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:16,250
understandings of how it's particularly

28
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:17,480
cannabis reacts to the nine cardinal

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,359
principles you never talk to doctor

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,880
Bugbee about this kind of stuff you find

31
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,459
out what's in our control that's you

32
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,909
know wind speed temperature humidity and

33
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:30,530
co2 delivery right as HVAC people we

34
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:31,670
don't control the lights the growers

35
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,859
gonna pick a light that they think is

36
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,359
gonna give them the best result we don't

37
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:37,069
control the root condition directly I

38
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,260
mean we can do underfloor heating and

39
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:40,429
things like that in greenhouses and that

40
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,990
kind of thing and the room temperature

41
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,950
does affect the route temperature but

42
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:48,379
yeah those are those are the four

43
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,079
cardinal things that we play with so I

44
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:53,269
would add air quality to that we also

45
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,319
have control over the constituents in

46
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:58,849
the air such as mold spores biosecurity

47
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,709
tests and things like that through air

48
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:03,079
filtration and purification yeah

49
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:04,369
absolutely yeah and in your presentation

50
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,899
earlier you made a very good point

51
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:10,340
people are blasting money away in Merve

52
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:12,680
Merve 15 or better like hepa type filter

53
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,180
ation systems which are complete

54
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,390
overkill

55
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,540
you know merv 13 is like it's a very

56
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:21,119
readily available filter

57
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,370
the pressure drops are much better since

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,280
they became like a lead standard as well

59
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,480
the filter designs have gotten better

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,878
and that's you know that's basically

61
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,219
where we stopped our units don't use any

62
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:34,530
of that stuff so anything happened

63
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,060
beyond it's just kind of overkill but

64
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,280
yeah I don't know we see these

65
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,650
challenges all the time one of the

66
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,449
things I would say is that you know we

67
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,719
see this VPD term being thrown around

68
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:48,089
constantly by growers who are picking a

69
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:51,180
number and they are using it as gospel

70
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,219
and that drives me nuts it probably

71
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,170
drives you nuts too and there so there's

72
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,989
a lot of adaptations the plants have to

73
00:02:55,169 --> 00:03:00,988
deal with changes in VPD just a model

74
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,730
control they have active uptake of water

75
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,469
through their root systems so like if

76
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,119
the humidity levels too high during the

77
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:07,829
night period you'll see water actually

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,359
coming out of the tips of the leaves I

79
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,709
think it's called good tation they'll

80
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,420
start to just build up a ton of pressure

81
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,878
inside themselves even when the VPD is

82
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:17,939
totally maxed out or sorry the humidity

83
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,739
is totally maxed out yeah so again

84
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,419
that's is that so as that is that

85
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,099
happening because there's another

86
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,899
mechanism driving water out of the plant

87
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:26,280
yeah the roots or the roots can actively

88
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,049
take up water to build up a root

89
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,189
pressure West Drive which also helps

90
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,269
drive water through the plant as well

91
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:31,709
got it yeah

92
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,120
and there's also aquaporins that are

93
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,128
just like active open channels that are

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,569
constantly drawing in water okay yeah

95
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:38,489
yeah it also has to do with solute

96
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:40,500
gradients inside between the actual

97
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,180
rhizosphere and the root itself as well

98
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,530
so giving the you know keeping your

99
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,909
humidity levels in check in the room is

100
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:51,019
giving the water a place to go yes yeah

101
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:51,019
yeah otherwise it the plan just like

102
00:03:54,229 --> 00:04:00,598
yeah I think one of the reasons that

103
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,120
high VPD numbers you know obviously very

104
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,469
low VP DS when you draw a VP D chart at

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,750
a hundred percent relative humidity in

106
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:08,789
the room it's zero and that's a red zone

107
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,560
on every chart because you're not

108
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:11,789
getting any carbon dioxide in because

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,939
the water molecules that would be

110
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:17,279
leaving due to vapor pressure are not

111
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,168
exiting the stomata and therefore co2

112
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,149
can't get in on the opposite side if

113
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:23,250
it's too dry you have so much water

114
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:26,069
leaving that's such a rate that co2

115
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,680
can't get in but you know I just looked

116
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:30,478
at some research from last year that

117
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,160
indicated you know as long as you have a

118
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:36,719
high enough level of co2

119
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,010
VPD was not so much a factor all the

120
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,960
things being equal VPT wasn't

121
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:42,149
necessarily a factor for photosynthetic

122
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,639
rate or carbon synthesis or an

123
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:46,889
integration simulation inside the plant

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,889
so if you can keep your co2 levels high

125
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,839
enough you can have a high VP D or a low

126
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:54,000
V PD and still have decent

127
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,669
photosynthesis again you have to be

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,980
mindful of how you get water through the

129
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,569
plant and whatever nutrients and how

130
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,770
that affects nutrients exactly because

131
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:03,180
there's you're gonna get different

132
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:05,189
transpiration rates out of different

133
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,600
leaves at different you know levels of

134
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:08,160
the plan going from the newest growth

135
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,110
down to the older growth where the leaf

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,760
is very mature it's very large you can

137
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,439
get such a high transpiration rate out

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,089
of these large leaves just not

139
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,920
necessarily like per area but there's

140
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:18,839
just so much of that leaf at that point

141
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,240
it's very developed a vascular system

142
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,459
it's gonna draw nutrients into that

143
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,810
larger leaf the nutrients that are

144
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,430
dependent on water flow through the

145
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,319
plant at least some are more mobile and

146
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,819
can be moved around or phloem dependent

147
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,199
but the ones that are really based on

148
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,180
movement and the water tubes throughout

149
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,129
the plant are gonna end up getting drawn

150
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,930
to that larger leaf and that's why you

151
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:38,909
see a lot of the tip burn issues like in

152
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,490
lettuce plants it's because there's no

153
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,080
calcium making it to the actual new

154
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,090
growth because there's so much water

155
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,589
movement coming out of the larger leaves

156
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:48,539
that you just start to get these

157
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:50,159
crinkled edges where and when the leaf

158
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,230
actually expands it's like pinched on

159
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,210
the edges because there was no calcium

160
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:57,360
movement into it so you know I

161
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:59,069
definitely can see that a very high V PD

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,420
can be very risky just in terms of that

163
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,279
because you're not getting an even

164
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,790
movement of nutrition through the plant

165
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:08,039
yeah VPD also affects how much water the

166
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,610
plant uses i mean if you just think

167
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:14,010
about it right so if you just think in

168
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,379
terms of water efficiency and water

169
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:19,079
utilization when you have a higher VPD

170
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,449
the plant has a greater demand for water

171
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,250
and so you're going to have to irrigate

172
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,370
your plant more to keep it well watered

173
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,519
so that you know it can keep growing and

174
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,910
it's gonna not wilt and all these things

175
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:34,859
and at a lower VPD the plant has less

176
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,439
pressure on it to use that water and

177
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:41,910
like I mentioned in my talk earlier that

178
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:45,180
you can we can actually control VPD when

179
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,639
the plant is very young to turn it into

180
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,500
a

181
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,769
tolerant plan so that when it grows up

182
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,579
and it's an older plant it requires less

183
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:57,188
water right those plants have more

184
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:59,228
smaller stomata so just like in terms of

185
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:01,180
controllability like right like you have

186
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:02,908
you know variable speed compressors

187
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,110
almost it's like you have all these

188
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:08,050
stomata that when they're all open it's

189
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:12,819
like three big stomata right with thirty

190
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,620
tiny stomata I mean it's always

191
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:16,509
mimicking its environment or at least

192
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,038
like it's it's a reciprocity between the

193
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:19,210
environment of how its gonna develop a

194
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,490
leaf even down to just like the

195
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:23,258
chloroplast level where the chloroplasts

196
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,150
are positioned inside of the Mesa fill

197
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:26,740
cells inside the leaf is going to be

198
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,149
dictated by the type of light source the

199
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,379
intensity of the light source the

200
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:29,769
thickness of the leaf will change as

201
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:31,150
well

202
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:32,500
so when you're in that type of light

203
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:34,568
setting and then you go to another light

204
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,490
setting you know now the plant has built

205
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:37,750
itself for this light source at this

206
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,278
intensity and it has to totally change

207
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,319
there's a tremendous amount of energy

208
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:44,110
that's why you'll see these like long

209
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,218
lag lagging acclimation times going from

210
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,710
one environment to another and it's the

211
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:49,389
same thing with VPD because it's built

212
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:50,709
that it's built that way it's I mean

213
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:52,088
it's intense to say that you could build

214
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:53,348
a drought tolerant plant but I get what

215
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:55,838
you're saying for sure that it's like

216
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:57,128
it's it's adapted itself to that can do

217
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:59,978
those conditions and now it has to

218
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:01,449
change it's still model density or you

219
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:04,568
know if the quantity per area or the

220
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:07,088
size like to adapt to that change one of

221
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:09,338
the things I'd like to see because again

222
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:10,959
this strict adherence to a VPD chart

223
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:14,288
that they took off the High Times

224
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,668
magazine website article whatever it's

225
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:18,158
like we're gonna use this chart as

226
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:22,088
gospel and they've circled whatever

227
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:25,088
number you know the better charts they

228
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:28,449
are their temperature specific to leaf

229
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:29,918
temperature and our you know relative to

230
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:31,538
the atmosphere because you have to

231
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,728
redraw the chart based on the radiation

232
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:36,338
source but even to that end like you

233
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:39,158
said within a gradient of canopy which

234
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:41,469
leaf are you going to measure to get

235
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:43,899
your VPD from it it's more an argument

236
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,730
against using VPD without understanding

237
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,019
all the variables right and

238
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,570
understanding that when you say I want

239
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:51,759
this VPD in my room that you've taken an

240
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,980
average leaf temperature and

241
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,659
and a good estimated guess of what the

242
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,149
leaf temperature is and understand that

243
00:08:55,659 --> 00:09:00,699
that's the VPD for those leaves at that

244
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,259
temperature so what is an average leaf

245
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,790
temperature and how do you get that what

246
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:05,559
what exactly does that mean well it

247
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:07,750
depends on the radiation source so a

248
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:11,739
radiation source is going to have a lot

249
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:14,169
of infrared or no infrared and depending

250
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,330
on whether it's one or the other the

251
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:18,969
transpiration through the leaf is going

252
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,940
to cool that leaf and if I have a high

253
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:25,000
infrared and you know hid in light like

254
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,100
an HP s system leading heating my plant

255
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,529
leaves I need to keep the room a couple

256
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,840
degrees colder than where I'd like the

257
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:33,339
leaf temperature so a couple three four

258
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,600
degrees Fahrenheit below the leaf

259
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,970
temperature temperature I'm trying to

260
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,470
maintain in an LED system I still have

261
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,240
transpiration even though I've got

262
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,509
mostly photosynthetically active

263
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,580
radiation hitting the leaf I'm gonna

264
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:47,049
keep that room warmer because I don't

265
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,360
have I'm not cooking the leaves with my

266
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:51,669
light source but I'm still transpiring I

267
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,009
need to get heat into that leaf to get

268
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:55,509
the water to turn into vapor so I've got

269
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:58,149
to keep that lieth at room temperature

270
00:09:55,509 --> 00:10:01,330
warmer hella d rooms 82 to 85 degrees in

271
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:04,419
the flowering stage for cannabis HTTP

272
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,070
rooms 75 degrees you have to play with

273
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,079
those numbers because we're shooting for

274
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,240
a leaf temperature we're shooting for a

275
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,160
temperature where the metabolism when

276
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,169
you give it enough carbon and all the

277
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,719
other right elements is gonna be in that

278
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:19,269
optimum band too hot and that band falls

279
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,920
off too cold that band falls off they

280
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:23,019
like to play within you know between 20

281
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:24,819
and 25 degrees which is probably too

282
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:26,559
large a number for what we're talking

283
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,140
about if you guys have better arranges

284
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:33,759
or you know an optimum for a cultivar

285
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:39,129
for leaf temperature I'd love to hear no

286
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:41,110
pressure probably 80 degrees for

287
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,460
something like tomato in cannabis I'm

288
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,129
sorry for mixing up Celsius and

289
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:49,990
Fahrenheit it's fine so that's 27 or 28

290
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:53,049
degrees Celsius and for a lettuce plant

291
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:56,379
we're probably looking closer to 70

292
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:57,469
degrees Fahrenheit so 21 degrees Celsius

293
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:00,500
is

294
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,480
is you know the the target but you know

295
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,370
route temperature also has a play in

296
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,409
this you know I mean we could have an

297
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,210
excessive air temperature and leaf

298
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:10,279
temperature but if we can also control

299
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,080
the root zone temperature then maybe we

300
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,759
can compensate for some of the high

301
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,620
temperatures at the leaf but the thing

302
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,679
is is that there unless you're doing

303
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,360
true like hydroponics where you have you

304
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,250
know deep water culture or something and

305
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,600
you can really control the water

306
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,149
temperature to control the root

307
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,580
temperature I mean you're really

308
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:30,079
controlling the plant with the air most

309
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,300
people are most people are dependent on

310
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,220
just where their water storage is that's

311
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:35,959
the temperature of it with it's inside

312
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,129
maybe it's a conditioned space and they

313
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,810
can have a little more control that way

314
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,490
but I've seen some people where they

315
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:41,989
have it outside and so the water is

316
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,820
coming in at like 50 degrees Fahrenheit

317
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,049
like as it's been sitting out there

318
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,870
during the winter and then you water the

319
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:49,729
plants with that and that is detrimental

320
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,490
vice versa I've been in a greenhouse

321
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:54,889
where they had their water storage tank

322
00:11:52,490 --> 00:12:02,419
outside it was in Nevada and so as you

323
00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:06,409
know 110 degree water algae actually

324
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:08,409
because it was a clear tank so can I can

325
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:11,539
I ask the play outside just something

326
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:14,059
why does the VPD chart have a band of

327
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:17,599
green a band of yellow and two bands of

328
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:18,769
red typically and those bands extend all

329
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,420
the way up to these temperatures where

330
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:22,460
you'd never want to grow a plant in the

331
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:25,729
high range into a very very low

332
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,590
temperature in the low end where you'd

333
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,149
never want to grow a plant anyways why

334
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,160
is that green band there why is the

335
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:34,730
yellow band there what are the why did

336
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:36,230
those colors come about I mean it's just

337
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,730
different research that's happened with

338
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,500
different crops and like extension

339
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,480
services trying to actually create

340
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,340
something to give a reference to it's

341
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,139
largely just like it's it's just

342
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,780
physical values presented in that way

343
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:50,360
and those have those have been shown

344
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:52,189
with various crops to like to have high

345
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,590
productivity cannabis it's the only one

346
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,660
that's really just brought in like a

347
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:59,300
different practice historically okay I

348
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:01,370
mean I would say I mean when we look at

349
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:03,709
the vbe chart and when we create them

350
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:06,080
for different crops I mean we will try

351
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,519
to trim off the edges depending on what

352
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,670
the plant is so if you look at our

353
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,980
lettuce chart it's very small compared

354
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:14,329
to say the Cannabis chart but also I

355
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,769
mean if you think about with cannabis

356
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,680
and tomatoes and and let's say we're

357
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:20,509
growing in a greenhouse and you know we

358
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:23,000
didn't oversize the system for the peak

359
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,350
load or whatever and so we know that

360
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,110
there's gonna be days that it might be

361
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:30,230
90 degrees in that greenhouse okay

362
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:35,450
that's not ideal but if it is 90 degrees

363
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:37,430
in there what is it's only about water

364
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,470
movement the VPD charge so it's it's

365
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:41,899
these it's it's fairly theoretical with

366
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,370
some some experimental information put

367
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:45,379
in there but it's some of that some of

368
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,700
the ends of that chart are kind of

369
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,509
irrelevant because it's only about

370
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,230
whatever them

371
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:53,480
yeah the VPD gosh sure yes so I mean so

372
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,730
when we're talking about Rubisco

373
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,620
activity which is the it's the 50%

374
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,870
protein of plant leaves is what's being

375
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,669
used to actually fix carbon that has its

376
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,340
own temperature limits as well so

377
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:06,769
whereas like your VPD may be okay at

378
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,389
this like high range on that graph which

379
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:11,299
is it's still in that green zone still

380
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:13,069
around 1.0 you know but now you're

381
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:14,750
Rubisco activity is starting to fall off

382
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,940
right or you're having leaky cells

383
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,470
because the membranes cancer membranes

384
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,270
are made of fats and they'll they'll

385
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,800
change out the types of fats to make

386
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:24,110
sure they're keeping the contents inside

387
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:26,269
of the cell so that you know they'll put

388
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,789
in more liquid fats or more solid fats

389
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:30,289
and based on what the temperature is so

390
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:33,500
like if it's a really hot day you want

391
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:35,509
more or is it unsaturated fats in that

392
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,279
place that are gonna actually like have

393
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:39,049
more fluidity and build withstand higher

394
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,909
temperatures you know I'm sorry

395
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:42,589
saturated fats and then in the other

396
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:44,149
direction if it's really cold you don't

397
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,620
want fast that are gonna harden in cold

398
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,909
temperatures and separate and create

399
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,500
pockets where there can be things

400
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:50,600
leaking out of the cells so there's

401
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,639
other things related to temperature that

402
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,360
are not related to VPD or transpiration

403
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,279
got it yeah well the one thing one thing

404
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,680
I would say about that is as soon as you

405
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,509
get out of the temperature band and you

406
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:05,839
start moving the humidity's around your

407
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:08,750
leaf temperature changes right so the

408
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,629
same room with even if you played along

409
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:15,769
and went to a green part on the VBA

410
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:17,600
chart in the same room it's not gonna be

411
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:19,490
a two degree temperature leaf difference

412
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,290
and you have to redraw your chart for

413
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,060
whatever the new leaf temperature is so

414
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:25,879
I think what I'd like to see

415
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:27,679
the building control world at the

416
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:29,629
building automation world is a good

417
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,059
leave temperature sensor that will help

418
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:34,370
you redraw the leaf temperature help you

419
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:36,199
redraw the VPD chart and let you play in

420
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,120
the new numbers when you get to those

421
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,009
spots I think it's less important in

422
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,590
Indore because we have very tight

423
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:44,509
control over the room temperature but if

424
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,670
you're going to have different cultivars

425
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:48,409
and play in different temperatures and

426
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:49,610
humidity you have to be able to

427
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:51,769
understand that belief temperature has

428
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,019
changed and your adherence to an old DPD

429
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:56,629
chart needs to be revisited like for

430
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:58,549
sure and in you know to that and I would

431
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:00,919
also say if you're not getting airflow

432
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:02,240
into the canopy in a consistent way no

433
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,219
matter what you do with your air

434
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,740
conditioning system which is doing bulk

435
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,210
removal of moisture and ten changing the

436
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,750
temperature to keep the temperature of

437
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,820
the room

438
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,529
somewhat accurate if I can't get that

439
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,510
dry air into the canopy or that

440
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:17,959
conditioned air into the canopy along

441
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:19,519
with co2 it really doesn't matter you

442
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,070
know air flow inside the rooms is as

443
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,049
important as anything else yeah and and

444
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,470
the old ways of doing oscillating fans

445
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:28,639
inside the rooms that has got to go

446
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,950
especially as we go to two and three

447
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,169
tier type systems you just you're not

448
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,259
going to get that consistency of product

449
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:38,059
yeah you're gonna end up with pockets of

450
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:41,689
very bad pathogen growth higher higher

451
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:44,629
resolution air flow more locations yeah

452
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:47,600
we're all three of you in the HVAC

453
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:49,610
session I was I was asleep

454
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:55,250
you were speaking yeah all right were

455
00:16:49,610 --> 00:17:00,589
you there you your key takeaways from

456
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:03,200
his presentation okay it was a very

457
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:06,980
intense discussion of plant physiology

458
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:11,269
and how it pertains to HVAC very you

459
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:14,480
know it was I felt it was very well

460
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:16,189
spoken but also there was some like new

461
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,959
information presented that no one's

462
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:20,630
really paying attention to yet it was

463
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,310
talking about comparing different BPD's

464
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,430
at different co2 levels which is

465
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:27,708
important you said some stuff just about

466
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,940
demonstrating that you're getting the

467
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,100
same photosynthetic rates at different

468
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,840
VP DS but you're also getting different

469
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:34,399
transpiration rates so you know you can

470
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:35,740
it's demonstrating you can get similar

471
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,559
productivity

472
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,370
even at a much lower energy cost because

473
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,529
you're not having deal with so much

474
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:43,389
transpiration but then that also that

475
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:45,460
also introduces some more like pest

476
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,900
issues because not you know if you don't

477
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,460
if you don't have clean starting

478
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,660
material coming into the gross space

479
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,730
like a lot of people are dependent on

480
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,320
nurseries to get clones and those

481
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,819
nurseries aren't always clean they don't

482
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,109
sometimes they're already coming in with

483
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:57,669
spores all over them or they're coming

484
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:59,439
in with bugs on them and so you don't

485
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,058
have an opportunity to defend yourself

486
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,380
against that so that's why traditionally

487
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:07,089
a lot of people have just worked with

488
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,809
the higher VPD low humidity values but

489
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:10,299
yeah

490
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:11,678
I also think it was important - it

491
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,450
wasn't necessarily highlighted in the

492
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,470
discussion I think it's just because of

493
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,759
what we're there to talk about was

494
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,079
mostly about water and energy and

495
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:21,970
productivity but the effects of co2 are

496
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,678
also there they're affecting the

497
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,329
transpiration rate as well as they're

498
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,610
affecting how the system how the stomata

499
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:29,199
operate which is affecting how water

500
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:30,969
moving water is moving through the plant

501
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,759
and so we didn't really get a chance to

502
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:37,360
go into maybe some of the effects of co2

503
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:43,539
levels on VPD as much as I really wanted

504
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:47,079
to so B for another we have a camera and

505
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:49,269
microphones I feel like he put the ball

506
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:52,089
on the tee for you so now can you

507
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:54,039
reinforce the like give us the give us

508
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,899
the juicy key points that you made and

509
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:57,369
you wanted people to walk away from and

510
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,450
then elaborate on the thing that he

511
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:04,149
wished yeah so the the takeaway is we

512
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,220
have those four cardinal points that you

513
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:09,240
know biosecurity is the fifth

514
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:12,490
temperature humidity wind speed in co2

515
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,960
plants are very reactive they are

516
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,690
smarter than most people give them

517
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,569
credit for they will react to their

518
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,970
environment and do their best to

519
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:23,799
increase their metabolism in the most

520
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,440
efficient possible way given the

521
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:29,940
materials they need to get by if you

522
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,529
give them more co2 enough co2 to

523
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,850
increase their photosynthetic rate they

524
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:36,220
understand that they no longer need to

525
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:37,959
keep their stomata so open and they can

526
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,299
start to close them off and along with

527
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,829
that closing of the stomata comes a

528
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:44,049
reduction in the transpiration rate

529
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:46,960
which means it needs to move less water

530
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:49,158
through the plant to maintain the Turner

531
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,278
in the plant to maintain

532
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:53,720
take of the nutrients and it's just it's

533
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:55,519
better all around for the plant the

534
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,749
plant is gonna grow typically at a much

535
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,058
higher rate and have much higher

536
00:19:56,749 --> 00:19:59,868
photosynthetic activity correct yeah

537
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,970
there you go

538
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:03,738
so the talk yesterday was very similar

539
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,858
to what you talked about today which is

540
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:09,499
your VPD line your vbd

541
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:10,970
is the difference between the vapor

542
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:13,548
pressure at whatever leaf temperature

543
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,368
you're at minus whatever the room

544
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:18,558
condition is and you can draw that chart

545
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:21,348
and adhere to that chart as much as

546
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,788
you'd like but your chart has everything

547
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:24,259
to do with where you put the leaf

548
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:26,509
temperature and every time you change

549
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:28,429
that leaf temperature you have to redraw

550
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:31,639
the chart to know where you are on the

551
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:34,278
VPD you know with your VPD and to that

552
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:37,638
end wind speed affects leaf temperature

553
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:39,769
relative to the room temperature the

554
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:41,778
humidity changes the leaf temperature

555
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:43,249
relative to the room temperature there's

556
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:46,519
all sorts of other things like stomatal

557
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:48,579
conductance these things affect and and

558
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:50,808
lighting intensity on the plants affect

559
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:53,298
leaf temperature relative to the room

560
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:54,499
temperature but now that we know those

561
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:57,229
things that we're starting to understand

562
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:59,419
those things better we have a better way

563
00:20:57,229 --> 00:21:01,788
to figure out what that leaf temperature

564
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:03,590
is with all these other sensors we have

565
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:05,628
in the room without actually having to

566
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:07,878
go and take the temperature of all the

567
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:10,128
leaves in the plant in the room and that

568
00:21:07,878 --> 00:21:12,408
is you know it's a surrogate for

569
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:14,478
actually doing that to know all those

570
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:16,099
other components we don't have to go and

571
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:18,859
take the measurement of every leaf and

572
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:21,378
we can do a better job of producing

573
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:22,878
plant matter out of a room using the

574
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:25,308
sensors we already have you know we've

575
00:21:22,878 --> 00:21:28,219
got rooms with 16 sensors in them

576
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:30,589
2-tier co2 temperature and humidity each

577
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:34,278
sensor has got those built into it we

578
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:35,839
can pull that data out and and make some

579
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:38,538
assumptions on wind speed because we're

580
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,408
doing static tests and those fans are on

581
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:42,739
24/7

582
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:44,629
running all the time inside the racks we

583
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:47,450
can come up with a leaf temperature at

584
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:48,769
whatever condition we're in and we're

585
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,288
gonna see we're doing the test right now

586
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:53,538
right we're running those rooms and

587
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:55,669
we're gonna figure out which conditions

588
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:57,190
are better for the environment we're

589
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:59,580
sending all that data to the cloud

590
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,950
amazon's analytics or

591
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:04,439
through millions of points of data I'm

592
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:07,500
gonna tell us hey this cultivar in this

593
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,150
room is going to give you 2% more THC

594
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,160
right

595
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,009
you know we if we feed the data back in

596
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,340
then we'll have something to work with

597
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:16,289
here

598
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:18,869
we'll do some real good interesting

599
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:20,309
research yeah kind of the way I wanted

600
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:22,349
to express what you guys are doing is

601
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:23,970
like you know you're you're maintaining

602
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:26,069
the architecture of the plant like

603
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,799
because it's basically it wants to have

604
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:30,389
its leaves upright fully expanded so it

605
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,980
can constantly be harvesting sunlight

606
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,480
and if the conditions are not

607
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,339
appropriate for it to be able to control

608
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,839
its its water content if it's just

609
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:39,299
getting water ripped out of it there's

610
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:40,619
too much it's not able to keep itself in

611
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,629
a perfect position to harvest sunlight

612
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:44,099
if the temperature is off it's not able

613
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,440
to put actually like performance

614
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:48,419
enzymatic activity at the proper rate I

615
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,400
just recently saw for the first time

616
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,680
I've seen a lighting company advertising

617
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,450
that it's set on their site like

618
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,490
activate your Rubisco content of your

619
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,259
plants like I was like that's deep you

620
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,150
guys are really make because if you look

621
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:02,160
at some of the like they'll have like

622
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,870
co2 assimilation co2 assimilation rate

623
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,460
against like different temperatures you

624
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:07,859
know often you'll see like a peak of

625
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,380
activity at like you know 30 degrees

626
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:13,799
Celsius or higher and that's mostly just

627
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,420
because of the Rubisco activity so it

628
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,069
has it has its own thresholds to deal

629
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,990
with but it's there's also to consider

630
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:21,029
you know we talked a lot of other stuff

631
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,380
but long-term adaptations to these

632
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:23,970
different conditions are very different

633
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,890
than a short-term measurement that we

634
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,240
could take as well how does the plant

635
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,970
respond to that when it's endured it for

636
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,650
two months yeah so one of the things

637
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,049
that we we're doing with the data that's

638
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,280
you know paying back immediately is you

639
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:37,289
know you mentioned I think someone asked

640
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,670
the question in the previous talk how do

641
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:40,470
you measure transpiration rate right

642
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,930
what's the standard testing you measure

643
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:45,360
the plant over time you see how much

644
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:47,430
water's gone through it we can in a well

645
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,339
fill the room the sensors we put on our

646
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,840
air conditioning units we care so much

647
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:52,889
about it because with so much more

648
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,649
efficient we're trying to prove it to

649
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,480
the market we're using our sensors to

650
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,340
tell us how much water we take out of

651
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,089
the air every single minute of every

652
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:05,250
single day and we can see when the

653
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:06,980
emitters in a room get clogged or the

654
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,109
solenoids didn't fire to water the

655
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,058
and because the watering rate changed so

656
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:13,189
drastically from one day to the next we

657
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:15,470
can immediately fire an alarm right and

658
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,390
in one day if someone didn't notice that

659
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:20,269
the plants were wilting they can go in

660
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,620
there and fix that problem so so you

661
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:23,629
know we do have the ability to do

662
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:25,579
transpiration rate measurement which is

663
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,590
you know it's just one of those metrics

664
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:29,659
that is going to help us indicate plant

665
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:33,589
health and plant vitality and increase

666
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:38,480
our yields it helps a lot for planing

667
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:41,029
girl rooms too to have that data I have

668
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,360
a question you had spoken about training

669
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:47,269
plants when they're young to need less

670
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:50,119
water if you're successful at doing that

671
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:53,629
when they get older

672
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:58,579
are they tougher is or is the VPD less

673
00:24:53,630 --> 00:25:03,799
of an issue is the leaf temperature less

674
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:05,058
of a factor because they've been trained

675
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:07,009
properly

676
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:10,039
I've actually been sitting here thinking

677
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:12,169
that same question I don't know the

678
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:13,308
answer to that but I feel like the

679
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:15,740
answer has to be yes

680
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:18,710
I mean if we've conditioned them to be

681
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,720
drought tolerant and to be acclimated to

682
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:24,410
a certain environment where there's not

683
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,200
you know I don't know just a lush source

684
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:29,269
of water all the time then why wouldn't

685
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,759
there leaf temperature be different than

686
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:33,440
a different plant that wasn't

687
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,359
conditioned to be drought tolerant why

688
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,580
wouldn't there Rebeca levels be

689
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,709
different I don't know I actually don't

690
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:41,029
know the answer to that question I guess

691
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,529
it would depend on what environment it's

692
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:44,509
moved into after that you know if you're

693
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:47,058
doing it because these plants are going

694
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:49,308
into it a drought a drought type

695
00:25:47,058 --> 00:25:50,660
environment after being conditioned that

696
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:51,889
way then it's you know it's probably

697
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,360
gonna stay pretty similar to what they

698
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,650
were already existing in but if it's

699
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,939
going into something else I mean they're

700
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,740
constantly just adapting to their

701
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,750
environment and trying to reflect their

702
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,660
environment so I would think it would

703
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:05,390
change well why would you take a plant

704
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:09,620
that had been trained to be sort of

705
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:12,080
drought resistant and put it into a and

706
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:14,719
and then a smother it with water like

707
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,069
you know wouldn't you drown it will you

708
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,529
do whatever it took to get the most

709
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:19,819
productivity out of the plants so you if

710
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:20,250
it meant that that's how you got the

711
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:22,439
most part

712
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:25,470
to be out of it sure but it is

713
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,330
drug-tolerant resistant and but I guess

714
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,730
the whole point of this would the whole

715
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:33,629
point was that these younger plants that

716
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:37,279
have been trained this way are those

717
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:42,840
yeah and are still productive oh yeah

718
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:49,009
not necessarily for cannabis yeah so we

719
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:49,009
don't know we just take it we grow it

720
00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:01,579
[Music]

721
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,579
talking about energy resource

722
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:07,620
I'm een we're all talking about energy

723
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,260
but when it comes to agriculture and

724
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:12,779
farming really the question we should be

725
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:16,589
asking is about water the liquid gold

726
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:19,259
that's used to irrigate our farms you

727
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:21,649
know 65 to 70 percent of all the fresh

728
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:24,960
water on earth are used for irrigation

729
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:27,960
so ultimately when we solve the problem

730
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,919
about energy the next big question and

731
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,960
the question we should already start

732
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,690
asking ourselves is about water use

733
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,829
efficiency and you know being able to

734
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:41,009
collect the water that's condensed on

735
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:43,829
these air conditioning systems is a huge

736
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:45,900
opportunity and is probably one of the

737
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:47,939
something that we should be screaming to

738
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:51,480
the rafters that hey yeah we use a lot

739
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:54,000
of energy but we're recycling between 65

740
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,940
to 95 percent of the water that we

741
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,700
initially charged these facilities with

742
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,269
it's never leaving it is almost a closed

743
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,529
system

744
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:03,980
you know that's why we you know we're

745
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:06,359
not proponents of desiccant or

746
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,460
economizer cycle type systems that are

747
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:10,709
just blasting the water out to the

748
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,569
atmosphere you know we use an energy

749
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,909
recovery system around our cooling coils

750
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:16,288
which makes it way more efficient but

751
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:18,090
also we get to collect all that water

752
00:28:16,288 --> 00:28:19,980
none of that water leaves the facility

753
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:22,230
it comes out of the condensate drain so

754
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,599
as you treat it appropriately don't just

755
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,950
feed it back into your plants you know

756
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:27,779
make sure it's clean and everything else

757
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,240
and then you can feed it back in but

758
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:32,658
yeah we capture all that water a gallon

759
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,638
in 99% of that gallon comes

760
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:36,409
of that pot so I don't know if it's

761
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:39,738
relevant to this discussion but I've

762
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:41,809
been on a couple of dry farms cannabis

763
00:28:39,739 --> 00:28:43,579
dry farms in southern Humboldt are kind

764
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:46,009
of scattered along the eel River and

765
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:48,710
they're really amazing extremely

766
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:51,858
productive were you high I was not at

767
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:55,069
the point I was I was just doing well

768
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:57,949
well well III have been high from the

769
00:28:55,069 --> 00:29:00,618
produce from those farms really great

770
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:02,058
flower and the plants it's so like at

771
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:04,249
the base of the plant it's like

772
00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:05,839
literally like desert it's as dry as

773
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:09,679
desert and yet the plants themselves

774
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:12,499
were thick and luscious like you can't

775
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,849
believe now that's obviously very unique

776
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:15,848
you know you have to have the ground

777
00:29:13,848 --> 00:29:19,700
water at there at the right place but

778
00:29:15,848 --> 00:29:23,269
but it's real I mean these are these are

779
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:25,098
thriving and and I'm just wondering if

780
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:27,108
there's if anything to be learned its

781
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:28,398
outdoor obviously it's not an indoor

782
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:30,408
environment that sounds like an

783
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:32,598
application for a drought conditioned

784
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:34,580
plant you know it's it's that's produced

785
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:37,069
produced and produced in a controlled

786
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:38,569
facility yeah to be handled that way and

787
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:40,878
then well you know it's very interesting

788
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:43,460
I didn't or sunshine Johnson is the name

789
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:45,259
of the grower I did an article and it

790
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,840
was titled they are the the art of doing

791
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:49,308
nothing because you know I and she's a

792
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,319
wonderful grower she's a traditional

793
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:54,348
grower and she's only been doing dry

794
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:56,388
farming for a couple of years but she

795
00:29:54,348 --> 00:30:00,229
literally let's kind of nature do all of

796
00:29:56,388 --> 00:30:02,209
the work and and I get one of the

797
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:04,389
lessons is just how Hardy and how

798
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,919
powerful the cannabis plant is in

799
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:09,558
drawing the water and the nutrients that

800
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:12,379
it needs from the soil again I don't

801
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:14,239
know if there's any applications here

802
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:16,759
other than you know your training your

803
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:20,379
plant to be drought resistant to an

804
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:23,089
indoor more controlled environment but

805
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:24,528
maybe there is I would you know there's

806
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:26,418
so many there's so many considerations

807
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:27,919
to take it I could even say if it's the

808
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:29,659
right thing or not because how many

809
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,690
cycles a year could you get from that

810
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:34,369
plant right she does want to eat one she

811
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,349
does one harvest a year when I was here

812
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:38,269
and it might take so long because this

813
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:39,769
drought resistant to get to that spot

814
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,479
but even if you brought it indoors

815
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:43,038
you're not gonna be able to go through

816
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:43,720
the flowering stage in the same amount

817
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,808
of time

818
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,279
I think that though all those factors

819
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:50,500
need to be considered because growing

820
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:53,740
cannabis indoors is a business right

821
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:56,798
people are trying to save the energy and

822
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:59,798
balance that with get the yield and also

823
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:02,918
maintain consistent quality because they

824
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:04,569
have contracts to fulfill so all these

825
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:06,240
things need to be balanced with how to

826
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:08,619
be doing the most energy efficient way

827
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:13,569
also I mean we're talking a lot about

828
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:16,389
productivity and photosynthesis but you

829
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:19,089
know there's also quality considerations

830
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:21,640
and you know when we have flowering

831
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:23,139
fruiting plants they're flowering and

832
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,419
fruiting because they're stressed and

833
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,580
think they're gonna die right I mean

834
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:30,280
they're like oh my god you know winter

835
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:32,889
is coming I'm about to die so I better

836
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:34,960
start the propagation process so that I

837
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,788
can send out my seed I can send out my

838
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,240
pollen I can accept the pollen from a

839
00:31:36,788 --> 00:31:42,129
male plant and so stressing them through

840
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,339
you know through drought conditions

841
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:47,289
through you know not giving them

842
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:49,240
nitrogen in the last week of their life

843
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:51,940
by dropping the temperature making them

844
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,319
think that the weather is changes these

845
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,429
are all techniques that they're using

846
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:57,308
and what they're doing is they're

847
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:59,409
inducing a stress response they are

848
00:31:57,308 --> 00:32:01,509
making the plant think that it's going

849
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:08,530
to die I mean it is gonna die don't get

850
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:11,379
me wrong exactly and so keeping things

851
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:13,960
from it and creating not a good

852
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,630
environment or not a great condition for

853
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,900
productivity is actually going to

854
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,880
improve the quality of what it is that

855
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:26,080
we want to consume unless it's a lettuce

856
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,970
okay I mean unless ya controlled stress

857
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:31,658
exactly it's controlled controlled

858
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:33,940
stress and steering in the plant that's

859
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:36,429
a really excellent point I think because

860
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,110
that speaks to really what it's all

861
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:39,730
about you know and what a lot of these

862
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:42,069
growers all about that's what they're

863
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,929
going for especially the small ones the

864
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:46,509
Kraft ones where it's all about quality

865
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:49,659
or they're out of business they're just

866
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:52,419
not mass producing to generate some oils

867
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:55,600
right you know a gummy bear or something

868
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:57,880
I shouldn't say that for a gummy

869
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,849
some sort of gummies shaped animal

870
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,470
creature delicious so um what else can

871
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:03,788
we talk about HVAC wise

872
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,850
what do you anything else you guys want

873
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:09,839
to cover any new Jimmy to get on a

874
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:11,798
soapbox sure no you do a soapbox or

875
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:14,589
absolutely you can plug it a little bit

876
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:17,440
or that's usually best done in terms of

877
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:19,538
any sort of new technologies or

878
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,980
innovations that are on the horizon fair

879
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:27,099
enough yeah we see data every single day

880
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:29,980
of brute-force dehumidification systems

881
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:33,369
or miss applied dehumidification systems

882
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:36,279
that create either microclimates or huge

883
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:39,399
energy bills and the technologies exist

884
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:41,440
now there's no excuse for people not to

885
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,179
be using these new technologies they

886
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,700
involve those energy recovery systems

887
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:47,860
around the cooling coils which is you

888
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,769
know a primary way to do this or liquid

889
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:53,859
desiccant systems these technologies are

890
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:55,900
out there and until people come to

891
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:57,908
realize that there is a better way to do

892
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,159
it and still get the precision you need

893
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:02,679
inside the room look at the airflow you

894
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,090
need inside the room but also understand

895
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:05,830
that airflow is such a big deal you

896
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:07,569
can't just buy an air conditioner and

897
00:34:05,829 --> 00:34:10,539
strap it to a room and expect it to do

898
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:13,090
the work so we don't like fans we don't

899
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:16,929
like air conditioners ideal all air flow

900
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:18,190
is natural no you what we need two air

901
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,570
conditioning and dehumidification if

902
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,820
we're gonna do an indoor grow we're

903
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,859
supplementing co2 to such a level that

904
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,990
if I just try to use outside air and

905
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:28,659
pump in a lot of co2 I'm gonna lose all

906
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:30,878
that co2 as the outside air comes in and

907
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,679
gets exhausted back out so I think air

908
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,628
conditioning and dehumidifying should be

909
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,220
done we should be doing it with more

910
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:40,929
efficient technologies so that's my one

911
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:42,579
rant and rave so buy a fish more

912
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:45,730
efficient mean more just simply more

913
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:47,648
energy efficient machine ologies

914
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:52,869
technologies yeah

915
00:34:47,648 --> 00:34:57,009
such as such as so one way to dehumanize

916
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:58,809
more efficiently is to run an energy

917
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,330
exchange system around the primary

918
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:03,309
dehumidification mechanism so like you

919
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:04,900
said in your talk mechanical

920
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:07,630
dehumidification means I'm gonna cool

921
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,010
the air down to or below the dew point

922
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:11,410
which is the temper

923
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:14,680
which do we'll form I'm gonna do that

924
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:16,719
with a cooling coil and before I get

925
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,579
that air to the cooling coil I can

926
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,349
exchange energy from both sides of that

927
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:22,539
coil so that the air that reaches the

928
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:25,150
cooling coil is already saturated I take

929
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:28,509
away all the sensible temperature based

930
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:30,760
cooling I needed to do using the energy

931
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:34,750
exchange from behind the coil to the

932
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,750
front of it so the effect is I get to

933
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,670
reduce the amount of compressors I use

934
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:43,260
inside my air-conditioning unit by about

935
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:45,909
50% somewhere between 35 to 50 percent

936
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,620
so that's a technological solution

937
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:49,690
absolutely that has been done people

938
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:51,519
like you would would do we've already

939
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,380
implemented all of our lives and we've

940
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,449
been the industry has done it probably

941
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,519
for about 40 or 50 years you know in

942
00:35:55,449 --> 00:36:00,189
places where you know we're in San Diego

943
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:02,019
many many engineering firms out here are

944
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:04,510
not familiar with the challenges of

945
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:06,219
dehumidification if this was Florida

946
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,750
we'd be having a different set of

947
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:09,969
engineers who can jump right in and say

948
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,769
yes we all do this yeah

949
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:14,379
up north I'm sorry go ahead go ahead I

950
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:19,000
was just gonna say I mean one thing also

951
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:21,220
is that conventional HVAC equipment has

952
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,239
been you know over the course of 20 30

953
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:27,009
40 years has been set to a higher

954
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:30,009
standard to meet certain energy

955
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:35,380
efficiency ratings and in order to meet

956
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:38,950
an ER and se ER and ier certain things

957
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:42,760
have certain changes in the design of

958
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:46,210
the HVAC system have occurred to reduce

959
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,720
compressor energy to reduce fan power

960
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:51,420
energy and the bummer part about that is

961
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:56,259
those things that have been done to

962
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:59,099
improve energy efficiency have have

963
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:02,170
resulted in less dehumidification

964
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:04,750
capacity of those equipments so I love

965
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,940
talking to mechanical engineers in the

966
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:09,159
south because they really understand the

967
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:13,030
challenges that energy efficient

968
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:16,420
equipment put on dehumidification

969
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:19,990
potential so it's fun I mean it's not

970
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:21,519
funny but it not funny ha ha funny but

971
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,389
you know you talk to a mechanical

972
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,159
engineer and

973
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:27,578
giorgia you just designed the

974
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:32,768
super-tight apartment building right and

975
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:35,829
they're using 17 or 18 seer vrf systems

976
00:37:32,768 --> 00:37:37,538
and they can't control humidity so what

977
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:40,528
are they doing in these buildings

978
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:41,710
they're installing standalone

979
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:47,440
dehumidifiers

980
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:49,179
Wow exactly so they're the same pains an

981
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,710
apartment building yeah in residential

982
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:52,868
building even commercial buildings but

983
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,639
I'm just giving this one example I mean

984
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:57,220
I have this image of an article in my

985
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,739
head where they're literally installing

986
00:37:57,219 --> 00:38:01,659
like in the wall standalone

987
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:03,788
dehumidifiers that look like like those

988
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:05,739
old radiant heaters that you would see

989
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:07,750
in like an old-school apartment they

990
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:15,098
make the same type of model but for a

991
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:17,559
dehumidifier and so structure - yeah

992
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:20,109
build the HVAC such that it took care of

993
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:22,119
both right and an ashtray is not

994
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:23,710
tackling this issue it's like this

995
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,539
elephant in the room and it's such a

996
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:28,750
bummer like there should be different

997
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:30,278
standards different codes based on your

998
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,659
climate zone I mean there are for a lot

999
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:36,548
of different things but for whatever

1000
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:38,710
reason energy efficiency is God yes no

1001
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:41,349
well they've started come up with MRE

1002
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:43,929
ash MRE and some other like heart load

1003
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:46,329
MREs but as it applies to the cannabis

1004
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:48,219
or indoor grow in general those

1005
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:50,619
standalone dehumidifiers are the bane of

1006
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:52,989
many growers existence I mean we go into

1007
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,548
grows where they have a graveyard of

1008
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:56,229
spare parts because they've all broken

1009
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:57,940
down and they've got new ones in and

1010
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,009
they're mixing and matching components

1011
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:02,139
and then they go and install them inside

1012
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:04,750
their rooms stuff as many between the

1013
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:06,639
lights as they can and the condensates

1014
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,608
fill up and drip dirty condensate water

1015
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:11,318
on top of their plant right we're

1016
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:14,500
proponents of get everything out of the

1017
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:15,808
room use one or maybe two units per room

1018
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,159
that are both temperature and

1019
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:20,230
dehumidification control systems have

1020
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:22,239
them like outside have them outside and

1021
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:24,519
duct it in and use that ductwork to

1022
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,629
deliver the air in a consistent way to

1023
00:39:24,518 --> 00:39:28,629
circulate the air through the room

1024
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:31,358
properly get it to the in rack fans and

1025
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:33,730
distribution systems you need to just

1026
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:35,088
that whole model boggles my mind and

1027
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,219
that's that's really essentially

1028
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:38,929
where we had our first kind of victory

1029
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:40,639
it was going up against one of the

1030
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:44,358
larger manufacturers who was first to

1031
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:46,759
market in the cannabis specific HVAC

1032
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:49,038
space and sitting at a table with them

1033
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:51,199
and having them justify their decisions

1034
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:53,900
and how they designed equipment and once

1035
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:56,598
you lay out every single aspect of that

1036
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,450
design versus a more holistic well

1037
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:01,430
thought out and well engineered design

1038
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:03,768
it's a no-brainer really it is and part

1039
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:07,278
of it comes down to having the tools

1040
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:08,808
I mean it's 2020 right we model every

1041
00:40:07,278 --> 00:40:10,699
single room there's no excuse for us not

1042
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:12,859
to we have very expensive bottling

1043
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,449
software we're going to use it we're

1044
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:16,489
gonna model every single room to make

1045
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:19,248
sure that I get the air where I need to

1046
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:22,429
inside the canopy it's just whether it's

1047
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:25,518
a greenhouse or indoor proper yeah

1048
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:26,989
that's has to do that too it's critical

1049
00:40:25,518 --> 00:40:29,748
also with these types of systems that

1050
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:30,978
enables you to actually it reduces the

1051
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:32,868
differential you have between the air

1052
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:34,098
coming into the space and the air

1053
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:36,829
conditions you want to maintain within

1054
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:38,660
that space as opposed to the redundancy

1055
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:40,759
brute-force methods that are traditional

1056
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:41,420
to the industry so far which is just you

1057
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:43,248
know commercial air conditioning

1058
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,358
equipment standalone dehumidifiers

1059
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:46,189
exactly what you guys have been talking

1060
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:48,348
about in that case all of your air

1061
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:50,389
mixing is happening in the room instead

1062
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:51,950
of supplying this like pretty close to

1063
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:53,838
what you actually want it to be supply

1064
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,968
air to the space you know you've got hot

1065
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:57,710
dry air you've got cold saturated air

1066
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:59,150
inside the space so then you have this

1067
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:02,778
little climate around the plants and all

1068
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:05,269
that's mixing on the plants yeah short

1069
00:41:02,778 --> 00:41:06,710
cycling air back to themselves right you

1070
00:41:05,268 --> 00:41:07,248
know they stopped a humidifying five

1071
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:10,789
hours ago

1072
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:13,159
yeah so like audience say Desert Hot

1073
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:17,479
Springs in it where it's desert and it's

1074
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:19,159
dry so that's a different problem in

1075
00:41:17,478 --> 00:41:21,379
solution isn't it you don't have a lot

1076
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:23,028
of humidity out there so you have to put

1077
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:27,979
moisture in are you talking about inside

1078
00:41:23,028 --> 00:41:30,170
a greenhouse in an indoor farm typically

1079
00:41:27,978 --> 00:41:32,748
we don't bring in a lot of outside air

1080
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:36,710
were recirculating the majority of the

1081
00:41:32,748 --> 00:41:39,738
air co2 levels right so the outside air

1082
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,478
has less of an impact on what's going on

1083
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:43,009
inside the farm but in a greenhouse

1084
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:44,868
environment that in a greenhouse

1085
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:47,179
environment sure I mean in that case we

1086
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:49,068
want to humidify your greenhouse so we

1087
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:52,159
want to use evaporative cooling we want

1088
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:54,889
to use high pressure fog system and add

1089
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:57,078
moisture because the VPD will be too

1090
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:59,058
high in there which is great I mean in

1091
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:00,979
terms of cooling efficiency evaporative

1092
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:03,200
cooling doesn't get more much more

1093
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:04,639
efficient when it comes to energy the

1094
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:08,838
problem is is that it uses a lot of

1095
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:10,848
water yeah so for my PhD I actually

1096
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:13,099
looked at water use efficiency of

1097
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:16,130
evaporative cooling systems for

1098
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:17,450
greenhouses and when I included that to

1099
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,338
the entire water balance of the

1100
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:21,439
hydroponic system all of a sudden it

1101
00:42:19,338 --> 00:42:23,568
looked like growing tomatoes in a field

1102
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,278
in terms of water use efficiency okay

1103
00:42:23,568 --> 00:42:26,808
yeah of course I would say that there's

1104
00:42:25,278 --> 00:42:28,460
a lot of benefits to growing in a

1105
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:29,778
greenhouse I mean just the quality of

1106
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,969
the product the control of the

1107
00:42:29,778 --> 00:42:34,190
environment year-round production you

1108
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:36,499
know t OVI me and it's gonna ripen right

1109
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:38,568
there and be as nutritious of a tomato

1110
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:41,659
as possible the altitude of the

1111
00:42:38,568 --> 00:42:45,079
greenhouse impact these factors the

1112
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:47,960
environment yeah sure so there's a

1113
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,710
reason why you see green houses being

1114
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:54,739
built at higher altitudes because the

1115
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:56,960
high maximum high daily temperature is

1116
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:59,239
lower also

1117
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,389
there's less obstruction to sunlight

1118
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:04,849
just through you know the particles in

1119
00:43:02,389 --> 00:43:09,528
the air so I mean really you're closer

1120
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:12,499
to the Sun so you get better light

1121
00:43:09,528 --> 00:43:13,960
transmission so it's cooler better light

1122
00:43:12,498 --> 00:43:18,498
transmission

1123
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:20,179
yeah there's absolutely I mean from an

1124
00:43:18,498 --> 00:43:21,528
HVAC perspective if you're designing a

1125
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:25,909
piece of equipment yeah absolutely

1126
00:43:21,528 --> 00:43:27,559
altitude changes everything but we have

1127
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:29,838
calculations to solve that problem and

1128
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:31,309
it's it's not a hero there I think it's

1129
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:33,858
a bigger deal for greenhouses for sure

1130
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:35,989
are your machines geared for certain

1131
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:39,798
size grows or do you work with all

1132
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:42,170
different size you know just in terms of

1133
00:43:39,798 --> 00:43:44,630
our bandwidth as a company we're trying

1134
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:47,659
to focus on 10,000 square-foot Ciotti in

1135
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,309
a facility or you know of but are we go

1136
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:51,929
into rooms that are about a thousand of

1137
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:56,370
1500 feet up to you nee

1138
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:58,139
that there's no top limit on that so my

1139
00:43:56,369 --> 00:44:01,079
kind of general takeaway from this is

1140
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:04,409
that there's still a lot of conversation

1141
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,679
to be had with the cultivators you know

1142
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:09,829
and education in order to get all of

1143
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,750
this right that there's still some

1144
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:16,230
misunderstanding and there's so many

1145
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:18,059
factors to consider and you know despite

1146
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,250
the fact that so many of them have been

1147
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:23,009
grow you know growing for a long time

1148
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:25,829
the learning curve is still you know

1149
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:28,200
there and straight up and that's just

1150
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,789
kind of my takeaway it's not the growers

1151
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:32,039
it's the science it's everything about

1152
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:35,940
this it's still so news right so there's

1153
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:38,519
yes so in general we just we need better

1154
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:41,059
communication education across the

1155
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:43,259
aisles if I can you know I mean

1156
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:45,650
manufacturers and engineers and

1157
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,810
technical people really need to

1158
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:50,820
understand the plant better they need to

1159
00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:52,860
understand the grower better they need

1160
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:55,110
to understand that farming is a business

1161
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,420
you know and just the complexity that

1162
00:44:55,110 --> 00:45:00,329
we've all been talking about in terms of

1163
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,849
growing a plant it's not just throwing a

1164
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:04,590
seed in the ground and then you know

1165
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:06,449
watering it and it's just gonna poof

1166
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:08,850
grow into you know the beautiful plant

1167
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:12,629
that you want it to be and then we need

1168
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:15,480
growers to understand the engineering to

1169
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:17,400
understand the implications of their

1170
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,559
choice of vapor pressure deficit you

1171
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:23,220
know also needs to understand this is

1172
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:25,349
home growers yeah sure you know because

1173
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:28,079
home grow is a really important part of

1174
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:29,940
this industry and hopefully will be

1175
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,190
allowed throughout this country you know

1176
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,440
there some states they don't want to

1177
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:36,809
allow it but that would be a really big

1178
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,269
mistake well they especially need to if

1179
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:41,190
they don't want to ruin their homes you

1180
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:43,920
go into any room that's how to grow in

1181
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:46,380
it and go looking for mold and you don't

1182
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,240
need to look too far right you put a

1183
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,920
high humidity room in a cold environment

1184
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:53,309
that wasn't meant to have a high

1185
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,110
humidity room in it I'm so sorry if you

1186
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:58,920
have other people living there besides

1187
00:45:55,110 --> 00:46:01,260
yourself but you've made a mistake is

1188
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,639
hugely problematic it's probably the

1189
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,310
reason that we have grocery stores today

1190
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,339
the fact is

1191
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:09,440
the production quality you can get from

1192
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:11,480
a craft grower is most likely gonna

1193
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,179
eclipse what most people can do at home

1194
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,760
right and look there's a novelty to it

1195
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:18,649
my parents are Italian my dad every year

1196
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,910
we harvested all the tomatoes and

1197
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,889
lettuce we know that we wanted to eat

1198
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:24,079
from our own backyard so I get the

1199
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:25,190
homegrown approach but if you're gonna

1200
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,909
put it indoors we're talking about

1201
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:30,740
indoor AG I think is an efficiency thing

1202
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:34,279
just be very careful are there any like

1203
00:46:30,739 --> 00:46:35,569
little grow rooms that work have you

1204
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:41,390
ever seen them work but I know that they

1205
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:44,590
exist the girl attends and they have

1206
00:46:41,389 --> 00:46:47,150
like cute really cool-looking

1207
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:50,420
architectural boxes with the lights

1208
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:52,280
inside and HVAC included and they do all

1209
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,990
the things but I've never seen them work

1210
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,090
they seem to be a novelty I'm sure they

1211
00:46:53,989 --> 00:46:58,279
do well with the problem be that there

1212
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:00,440
but porous or there they don't they

1213
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:04,910
don't maintain the correct environment I

1214
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:06,950
just haven't seen them work but they

1215
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:12,799
look very cool very cool looking for

1216
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:15,079
sure I really really enjoyed listening

1217
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,310
to this conversation I'm just curious to

1218
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:23,590
know about the the best way to price

1219
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:26,029
HVAC is it dollars per ton is it is it

1220
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:30,110
pounds of moisture removal per kilowatt

1221
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:34,160
and is there are there ways to specify

1222
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:35,840
it by square footage of grow or other

1223
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:41,329
are the challenges and pitfalls doing

1224
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:43,340
doing it that way I mean if we're

1225
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:48,710
talking about conventional equipment

1226
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:52,430
where a ton of cooling is includes both

1227
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:57,800
the temperature heat removal and the

1228
00:47:52,429 --> 00:48:00,829
latent moisture removal then you know we

1229
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,630
can use kind of our typical HVAC rules

1230
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:04,279
of thumb which ranges you know from a

1231
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,809
thousand to three thousand dollars per

1232
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,790
ton let's just call it that

1233
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:12,320
however because of dehumidification

1234
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:15,949
because it's not so II I mean you can

1235
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,869
convert you know pounds per hour to BTUs

1236
00:48:15,949 --> 00:48:19,669
per hour to a ton

1237
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:22,160
but really if we're talking about a

1238
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:26,180
dehumidification or moisture removal

1239
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:29,319
efficiency then basing a price on

1240
00:48:26,179 --> 00:48:31,699
tonnage might not make as much sense

1241
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:34,250
it's dependent on room conditions as

1242
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:39,710
well correct yeah yeah well your set

1243
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:41,719
points are oh so I agree with dollars

1244
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,760
per ton from our perspective because we

1245
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:46,699
have that energy efficiency mechanism

1246
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,329
inside of our unit which reduces tons by

1247
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:52,368
thirty five to fifty percent we use way

1248
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:54,980
less tons but we moved as much air and

1249
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:56,390
we have as many components in there the

1250
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,789
dollar per ton doesn't make sense so

1251
00:48:56,389 --> 00:49:02,809
we're looking we are striving for that

1252
00:48:58,789 --> 00:49:06,108
metric dollar per pound per hour is a

1253
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:07,880
good metric for us because the numbers

1254
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:09,049
work out to be you know not astronomical

1255
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,789
and not too small they're just kind of

1256
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,470
enough how do you figure this out how do

1257
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:14,000
you figure out ahead of time before you

1258
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:16,039
have to buy it how much you're gonna

1259
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,250
need what how much you're not gonna need

1260
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:21,380
to remove from the environment so before

1261
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:23,838
you purchase the thing or yeah so we

1262
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,880
have a most most manufacturers will have

1263
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:28,400
a project input form and that project

1264
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,800
input form is going to look at well what

1265
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,230
they're trying to get is what are the

1266
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,660
inputs of energy over the course of 24

1267
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:38,300
hours of the highest load of that room

1268
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:41,659
both in electricity and in water so

1269
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:43,369
remembering that transpiration is 99% of

1270
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:45,949
the water you put into the plant is

1271
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:47,660
going to end up out of the plant we need

1272
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:49,818
and into the air that we have to remove

1273
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:52,608
we're gonna look for the number of

1274
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:56,300
plants and the water per plant per day

1275
00:49:52,608 --> 00:49:57,889
at the peak time of transpiration to

1276
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,599
determine and that's that's not

1277
00:49:57,889 --> 00:50:01,368
necessarily the same thing as how much

1278
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,530
water I put in the root zone and how

1279
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:05,660
much water stays in the root zone in the

1280
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,650
course of that 24 hours I need to be

1281
00:50:05,659 --> 00:50:08,299
able to remove that with my

1282
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,250
dehumidification and temperature

1283
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,318
controls can you determine that while

1284
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,940
there while they're under construction

1285
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,829
we do it before they're under people

1286
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:18,019
okay yeah so there's usually a grower

1287
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:21,440
who's on board with the development team

1288
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:23,568
that grower will say I did this before

1289
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,849
and this is what we're gonna do here and

1290
00:50:23,568 --> 00:50:28,099
then we look at those numbers and say

1291
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:30,980
well those numbers are wrong because

1292
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:32,380
they are not accounting for

1293
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,269
you know they're not accounting for

1294
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:38,088
drainage or those numbers are right

1295
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:39,289
because they seem to fit a set of ranges

1296
00:50:38,088 --> 00:50:41,539
that we've run into time and time again

1297
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:43,519
or they're right because they fit the

1298
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:46,460
data we get out of rooms that are

1299
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:47,929
similarly designed to this with the same

1300
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,019
lighting technology in the plant density

1301
00:50:47,929 --> 00:50:53,419
things like that so we can advise and

1302
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:55,579
say your weed we think you might want to

1303
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:58,369
revisit this or we think your bang on

1304
00:50:55,579 --> 00:51:00,650
and then give them a size of equipment

1305
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:03,019
that they can then go and take to the

1306
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:04,900
market have you dealt with any and I

1307
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:07,608
know that several grows have hired

1308
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:09,548
growers from the Netherlands to come

1309
00:51:07,608 --> 00:51:11,960
over because they've worked at scale

1310
00:51:09,548 --> 00:51:14,000
have you dealt with any of them and is

1311
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,250
this stuff are they are late queued into

1312
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,010
all of this because they're so

1313
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:21,798
experienced some of them are amazing yes

1314
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:24,410
so at the Canadian greenhouse conference

1315
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:26,059
I ran into a number of them who had such

1316
00:51:24,409 --> 00:51:28,338
an incredible understanding of

1317
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:29,990
temperature and humidity control it was

1318
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:32,239
almost unmatched and I was very happy to

1319
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:34,789
be talking to them there were others who

1320
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:38,209
were 50 years in the greenhouse industry

1321
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:40,429
looking at newcomers like ourselves who

1322
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:42,619
come from the commercial and indoor AG

1323
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:44,298
space saying you don't know what you're

1324
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:46,068
doing this is a huge mistake

1325
00:51:44,298 --> 00:51:48,048
and you know this you know these things

1326
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:50,358
well these ideas will never work

1327
00:51:48,048 --> 00:51:52,429
those same growers those sorry those

1328
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:54,558
same greenhouse manufacturers you know

1329
00:51:52,429 --> 00:51:56,838
had their facility shut down because it

1330
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,730
wasn't a Canada fybel cannabis facility

1331
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:00,469
you know two up two months after it was

1332
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:02,210
bought they pulled all the plants out

1333
00:52:00,469 --> 00:52:04,279
had to destroy them all because the

1334
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:06,740
powdery mildew outbreak and it turns out

1335
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:10,130
that cut flower greenhouses are not

1336
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:11,328
ideal for cannabis so when people you

1337
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:14,660
know what we have to take what people

1338
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:17,269
say and their experience with a maybe a

1339
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:19,129
grain of salt sometimes they have a firm

1340
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:20,449
belief that they are the best right

1341
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:22,670
we've been doing this in the Netherlands

1342
00:52:20,449 --> 00:52:25,039
for so long how could dare you question

1343
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:27,260
us and then well look it's a it's a

1344
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:30,349
whole new world so what happens when the

1345
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:33,710
day comes and we've solved the mildew

1346
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:35,480
problem in cannabis if that day could

1347
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:38,409
ever comment below they're working on

1348
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:41,409
share the Sun is expanded in the or or

1349
00:52:38,409 --> 00:52:41,409
genetically

1350
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:50,129
new strangers say that we're done what

1351
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:51,960
does that change everything here does

1352
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:54,838
that change it's not just about powdery

1353
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:58,230
mildew or mold yeah it's about plant

1354
00:52:54,838 --> 00:53:01,108
health and but its nature of the more

1355
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:03,119
that causes growers to behave in a

1356
00:53:01,108 --> 00:53:05,250
certain way so their behavior might

1357
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,809
change that well it takes away one of

1358
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,699
the many variables they're concerned

1359
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:11,460
about okay yeah there are so many other

1360
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:18,538
pests and pathogens to worry about for

1361
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:18,929
sure right waterborne yeah okay thank

1362
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:21,109

1363
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:24,889
