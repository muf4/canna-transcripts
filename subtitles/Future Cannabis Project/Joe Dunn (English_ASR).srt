1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,400
[Music]

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,399
when Dr pmell called me weeks ago about

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,000
this potential conference uh and the

4
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,079
involvement of the law school here at

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,079
UCI he told me it was going to be on

6
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:26,719
Friday

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:30,518
afternoon uh in uh May 5th at 4:00 in

8
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:34,359
the afternoon CCO deile

9
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:37,079
I literally said to Dr py are you crazy

10
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:38,759
doctor I really didn't believe him that

11
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,558
we would draw this audience so a big

12
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,558
round for yourself for being here this

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:49,280
afternoon I also have to share a comment

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,920
uh about the congressman uh Dana and I

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,399
have known each other for probably 20 25

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,320
years uh I'm the flip side of Dana uh

17
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,198
Conservative Republican he is of course

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,198
uh I'm the progressive Democrat that

19
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:07,000
served in the state senate uh from here

20
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:09,158
in of all places Orange County 1998 to

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,680
06 County was a little more conservative

22
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,280
at that time I share that because uh

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,040
we're an interesting Dynamic on this

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,599
issue we disagree on most major policy

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,000
issues it's the nature of the Beast uh

26
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:26,000
but on this particular issue he's been a

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,719
leader his entire elected life I

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,438
struggled with these issues as a

29
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:33,078
progressive Democrat in Sacramento

30
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,679
at that time some of you may remember uh

31
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:38,359
now unfortunately he's no longer with us

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,600
Senator John vasconcelos who was one of

33
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:43,879
the leading advocates for both uh

34
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,158
medicinal marijuana as well as the

35
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:49,640
legalization of recreational uh

36
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,840
marijuana back at a time when everyone

37
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,640
scoffed at him in Sacramento uh but he

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,560
really through his own determination his

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,560
own passion really opened the door to

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,920
where we are today he sat right behind

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,039
me on the senate floor he talked to me a

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,840
lot as a progressive Democrat uh and

43
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,959
kept needling me of course about Orange

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,680
County uh so it's interesting that Dana

45
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,800
has been as a Conservative Republican a

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,000
passionate leader in this area for many

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,640
many years I a progressive Democrat

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,280
struggled with this issue but I have to

49
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:25,279
confess uh where I am today as uh one of

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,318
many who share the same views as some of

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,280
the folks who have already spoken I know

52
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:33,079
Dr uh uh Pali has focused solely on the

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,519
science uh but I'm a strong supporter

54
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,920
and I have to credit my daughter uh who

55
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,480
actually did that it's amazing how

56
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,000
daughters can affect dads uh and get

57
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,399
them to change their mind and my

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,439
daughter in fact did that I know some of

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,760
you in this room know her uh and I have

60
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:52,079
to credit her because she started uh

61
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:54,199
dad's Evolution uh as I was taught by a

62
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,959
younger generation I'm only going to

63
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,639
share a couple comments I know we're a

64
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,560
little behind and I want to turn the

65
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,279
podium over over to some of our

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,000
remaining speakers for a little extra

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:10,080
time uh but I am going to share another

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,878
part of this that it we feel here at UCI

69
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,920
is now necessary in the

70
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:18,518
evolution of all issues surrounding the

71
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:22,199
use of cannabis whether recreational Med

72
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:25,640
or medicinal um and that's something new

73
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:29,079
is as follows every time there's a major

74
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,598
industry that emerges on the scene and

75
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,120
grows

76
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:37,359
exponentially and everyone who observes

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:41,239
it uh Advocate or Foe knows that it will

78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,599
be uh in due time a massive industry

79
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:47,438
involving so many different elements in

80
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:49,719
society um and you know with cannabis

81
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:52,598
when we now have Venture Capital funds

82
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:55,598
that invest in the industry you have

83
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:58,719
major law firms uh uh that practice in

84
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,798
this area you have many of the very

85
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,199
established organizations in society

86
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,319
grav gravitating to this growing

87
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,598
industry what we feel at UCI is a

88
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,798
missing but

89
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:13,598
critical part of all of that puzzle and

90
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,959
you'll like this particularly Lori given

91
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,439
what you're doing um and that is to

92
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,280
create the nation's first academic based

93
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:23,279
interdisciplinary cannabis Research

94
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,279
Institute

95
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,800
I have to note uh as the congressman was

96
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:37,000
walking back up he and I have worked on

97
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
a lot of issues over the years that's

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,720
the way politics should work we'll

99
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,280
disagree on major issues but on those we

100
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,440
agree on we work together uh and he was

101
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,799
applauding uh the creation of that as

102
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,959
well we're in the early stages but I I

103
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,520
want to be very specific with everyone

104
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,879
about what that means because it may be

105
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,560
different than some of the Advocates

106
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,839
that may be here today there's something

107
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,199
very unique about an academic based

108
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,799
disciplinary Institute academic based is

109
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,439
critical it means it's tied to no

110
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,918
ideology it's tied to no specific

111
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,360
position in science or business or law

112
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:17,279
or art or communication

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,439
psychology it bases its positions solely

114
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,959
on academic

115
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:26,918
research that is critical it has always

116
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:30,399
been critical in mature societies to

117
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:33,560
ensure that we move forward based upon

118
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,359
independent research that is as free as

119
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,038
humanly

120
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,038
possible of outside

121
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,079
influence second I said

122
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,399
interdisciplinary there are a number of

123
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:50,318
centers around the country in uh

124
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,439
research institutions that focus in on

125
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,840
one area of

126
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:58,038
cannabis it may be the medic medicinal

127
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,799
impact such as Dr Pell's great work that

128
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:03,318
is known around the world

129
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,360
but for a new and growing industry it

130
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:09,080
needs interdisciplinary analysis it

131
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,439
means the law must grow in complement

132
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,439
with the science it means the theories

133
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,120
of business must adjust to the new

134
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,800
reality of a new industry it means the

135
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,120
financial industry must adjust with it

136
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,960
and adjust to an industry that is only

137
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,360
growing and is only going to grow bigger

138
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,638
and more established as we move forward

139
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,560
as a society the academic based

140
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:36,439
interdisciplinary Institute is frankly

141
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,519
the only way to fill that void so we

142
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:42,478
already have the involvement in setting

143
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:45,038
up this institute at UCI of course LED

144
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:49,598
and frankly it was his concept by the

145
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,598
great Dr pelli and now the law

146
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,120
school and there were some who advised

147
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,560
me when I went to ardan I think some of

148
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,240
you in the room have heard of him before

149
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,199
uh Dean Irwin chiminski uh that there

150
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,199
might be some concern and I sat down

151
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:12,360
with the dean and I said here's the

152
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:15,120
concept and he said well that's long

153
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,199
overdue thank you Dean chiminski we have

154
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,360
already been in Communications with a

155
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,759
number of the other schools on campus

156
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,639
from the business side to the

157
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,800
engineering side to the information

158
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,280
computer science side to the art side to

159
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,038
the communication side you name it we've

160
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,439
touched upon as many as possible with

161
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,478
more to go Go including for those who

162
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,120
are familiar with uh UCI the applied

163
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,318
Innovation Center which is on the back

164
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,720
side of the campus and that really is

165
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,360
designed to bring the scientific uh and

166
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,039
other research here on campus out into

167
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,720
the marketplace in a far easier fashion

168
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,839
than in the past when it comes to an

169
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,199
academic uh University setting uh so you

170
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,279
bring all those pieces together and it

171
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,319
will be the first in the nation that is

172
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,079
again I stress academic based

173
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,240
interdisciplinary Institute

174
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,758
and I want to share one out last thing

175
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,319
our hope is to do many Symposium and

176
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,759
Conference in addition to the great

177
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,199
research develop model policies The

178
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,199
Institute will never Advocate others can

179
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,079
take its work and Advocate but it can't

180
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,319
Advocate it would compromise its

181
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,198
independence we are in the process of

182
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,080
creating a large and diverse Advisory

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,199
board but I also want to stress it's an

184
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,560
Advisory board for those who are

185
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:30,080
unfamiliar with academic based Institute

186
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,320
it can only be governed by the academics

187
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,718
because that's the only way to protect

188
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,120
its independence on the research that it

189
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,039
does but The Advisory Board certainly

190
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,440
will be made up of experts uh throughout

191
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:43,679
and different perspectives of this

192
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,360
growing industry so that the academics

193
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,399
have that input can consider that input

194
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,600
but again all research will be

195
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,559
independent more to come stay tuned uh

196
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,519
and I will be by the way at the

197
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,039
reception later that's not a UCI related

198
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,360
uh reception but I know there'll be some

199
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,639
folks in the back of the room and out in

200
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,399
the hallway as we end today that we'll

201
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,958
have the invites and the maps I will be

202
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,759
there I believe the congressman will be

203
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:10,000
there as well we're happy to answer

204
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:13,278
questions uh at the reception as well

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,278
thanks everybody

206
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,428
