1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,039
do we want to talk about 2020 right now

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:09,539
well we're at we're at you just came

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,070
from all fires but I was at a fairground

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:15,419
so so a B 2020 by Bill quark is a bill

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,579
that also pending before the governor

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:20,698
essentially would expand the number of

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:23,429
license our number of eligible venues

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,470
for on-site consumption special events

9
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:29,189
the Bureau created the special event

10
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:32,250
license in through regulations you know

11
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,738
for the in the emergency regulations

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,769
there wasn't really statutory basis for

13
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,479
it but it goes and helps provide for

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,399
additional consumption opportunities

15
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,640
retail sale opportunities however by

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,719
statute it was limited to degree of the

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,939
consumption itself was limited to

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,929
fairground areas and so what this bill

19
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:53,339
goes and dies is expand the eligible

20
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:55,378
locations for consumption so it's not

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,989
just fairgrounds and district AG

22
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,179
associations it also could be wherever

23
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:02,878
essentially a city goes and license is

24
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:05,790
it if you know there is a restricted

25
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,618
access to 21 plus no minors going and

26
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,469
seeing the smoke I'm in a couple other

27
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:12,659
conditions so it's it's a bill that it's

28
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:15,179
anticipated to be signed and it will go

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,790
help cause an explosion of licensed

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,310
events but a licensed event is not

31
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,659
necessarily a compliant event and Pam

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,090
went to probably well the more compliant

33
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:32,850
events she's seen just earlier this week

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:36,450
but complain you can do a compliant

35
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:38,099
event that has what I will say the

36
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,140
version of sampling because you still

37
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:43,259
had to pay for your sample being very

38
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,509
important and there was one centralized

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,950
retailer that everything went through

40
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,840
interesting to note it was not a

41
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,820
retailer that was located in Sonoma

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,399
County or Santa Rosa so it will be

43
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,559
interesting to see where those tax the

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,570
the tax implications happen there with a

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,259
retailer not based within the county or

46
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:02,938
the city where the in bet was handled

47
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:05,188
but you got little tickets and you went

48
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,509
up and you had to pay a dollar plus the

49
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:07,799
excise tax also

50
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,719
a little weird since sometimes the

51
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,500
excise tax is embedded into the cost of

52
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:16,680
shipping but that is still how it went

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,930
uh this will sort of help I think what

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,640
we've seen more recently is these pop-up

55
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,030
events that are curved and how does

56
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:27,209
product get to such an event because it

57
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,090
cannot come from the manufacturer or the

58
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:33,090
cultivator it has to go through we do a

59
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,729
QC it at home to go through a retailer

60
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,840
so that the taxes are taken out and then

61
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:41,729
it goes to the event right so um this

62
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,860
will kind of help streamline getting

63
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:46,739
events in more locations which may then

64
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,450
help operators to understand that they

65
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,090
need to be compliant while they're doing

66
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:53,009
because it's if it's held at a licensed

67
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,950
facility that the city allows there's

68
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:57,599
gonna be a lot more robust regulation

69
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:59,458
that goes within that because it's

70
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,500
unfortunate with the level of pop-up

71
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,420
events that I've been seeing what would

72
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,539
happen if track and trace were truly

73
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:10,679
online yeah and you had to account for

74
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:12,870
how these samples got to an event and

75
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,959
didn't go through those proper channels

76
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,500
and just came your repair your

77
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,140
manufacturer and you bring your

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,389
manufacturing product to a private venue

79
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:25,199
it doesn't matter that that's a private

80
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:27,479
venue and isn't then eligible for going

81
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,629
through the event licensed rhetoric that

82
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,579
product is still licensed product and

83
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:35,900
needs to follow their correct supply

84
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:39,810
chain some whole thing that 20/20 does

85
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,760
more to instill an idea that you can

86
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,239
have more events that therefore are

87
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,620
responsible I think also there's other

88
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,599
challenges there though with this

89
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,000
special event license in general in

90
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,969
terms of the the fee per event is a

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,849
thousand dollars and is there a tent

92
00:03:53,969 --> 00:04:01,889
event cap as was in the radiation like a

93
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:03,269
proposed cap of ten events per year mmm

94
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:07,289
there was talk about that on some of the

95
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:08,580
toy 6:41 stuff but not not not in 2020

96
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,500
yeah we're still well we're I don't

97
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,980
think we are a statutory cap I believe

98
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,509
it's in I know we're going back and

99
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:20,009
forth sorry

100
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:25,379
gotcha sidebar Oh

101
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:27,689
ultimately there's there needs to be

102
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:30,089
other changes to the event language and

103
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,250
while we appreciate the fact that this

104
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:33,989
language is being moved in there there

105
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,300
are some just big questions on how

106
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,850
events or NIF events will work and part

107
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,009
of that's tied into if everything has to

108
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,360
be sold by a licensed retailer and move

109
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,269
through the supply chain violations

110
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,788
distributor to that retailer is there

111
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:49,978
what incentive is there for retailers to

112
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:52,110
take a chance on brands they don't know

113
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,060
if you have to have purchased that

114
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,069
product if you have to have possession

115
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,740
of that product for it to be at the

116
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:01,709
event at the booth of the manufacturer

117
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,350
or cultivator it's gonna disincentivize

118
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:07,379
you know a desire to go and allow

119
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,960
emerging brands to go and be at these

120
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:11,879
events additionally and that's why there

121
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,459
was some discussion and movement on the

122
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,620
bill 26:41 earlier this year which did

123
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:19,019
not make it through um it was held in

124
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,910
Appropriations Committee near the end of

125
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,819
the year which will allowed some degree

126
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,250
of farm direct consumer direct access by

127
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:27,899
licensed producers but even the

128
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,110
underlying issue there is there's just

129
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:33,060
some structural issues with events and

130
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,098
with running events through distro

131
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,930
through retail that I think we have to

132
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:40,199
address before we can have a successful

133
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,060
fix like 2641 or like something else is

134
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,620
just we need have a more discussion

135
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,620
about how to make events work

136
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,659
manufactures supposed to attract a

137
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,069
distributor without the ability to

138
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,570
provide them with a sample of their

139
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:01,569
products

140
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,569
well

141
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,550
