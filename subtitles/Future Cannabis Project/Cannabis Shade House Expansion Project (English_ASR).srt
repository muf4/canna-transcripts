2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,040
all

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:11,000
right so

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,279
we tripled the size of the shade house

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,280
the footprint we went out that way we

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,600
knocked that side wall out well not

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:21,640
sidew wall but we flipped it up and we

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,800
put the whatever kind of netting this is

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:28,240
up top so now we have

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,279
about 160 Square ft on this side to work

11
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:34,679
with and then we also upgraded from the

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,239
rain barrels we have two

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:40,238
275g

14
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:45,238
totes running out uh each will

15
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:45,238
eventually be running out to one to this

16
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:54,399
room you can see

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,399
we're getting to be about

18
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:03,359
8T about 8T now where this one is

19
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,679
and

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,560
then we extended this

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,880
way and this is iteration

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,040
one of the throw

23
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:18,519
Improvement clean come back and start

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:24,040
cleaning this up a little bit

25
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:26,158
but see 160 sare feet on this side ning

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,759
happy

27
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,560
plants and so yeah drip system for that

28
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:35,000
room and then a separate one for out

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,600
here so we have

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,959
19 different strains right now a lot of

31
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:43,478
different CBD

32
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:47,478
varietal bunch of different types of

33
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,478
OG so

34
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,799
and then one thing we eventually want to

35
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:25,119
do is put two drippers in each pot for

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,200
redundancy so these things get clogged

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,840
up although they're all working right

38
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:31,839
now so
