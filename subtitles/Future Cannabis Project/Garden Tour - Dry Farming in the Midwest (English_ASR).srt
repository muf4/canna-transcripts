00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,759
you guys

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,359
my version of a garden tour we're about

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,720
45 minutes south of chicago in the

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,440
midwest

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,040
and i just want to share some views i'm

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,798
not trying to show off i don't pretend

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,399
to be any kind of authority

9
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,759
i don't think any kind of growing style

10
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,959
like i don't think my style is better

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,960
than any other

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
i just want to show what works for me at

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,920
least what's working this season

14
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,839
where i am and uh i don't know hopefully

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,920
somebody out there needs to see this

16
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,879
i know maybe a couple years ago i wasn't

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,920
so sure that this

18
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:37,119
style would work where we are so

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,960
i'd like to see a video like this so

20
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,558
i do want to say thank you to future

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,239
cannabis project you guys are an

22
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,799
outstanding resource

23
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,479
the content you provide the speakers the

24
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,599
conversations they're bar none

25
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,439
especially when everybody's stuck

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
indoors so thank you so much for

27
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,920
allowing me to contribute

28
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,718
and i just really appreciate it

29
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
all right now one thing that's always

30
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,039
been fascinating to me it's always

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,558
been important is genetics

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,760
and selections and who's making those

33
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,959
selections

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,439
so i've always been interested in

35
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,438
breeding

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,320
everybody's lines that i choose to grow

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,079
they all seem to have very big heart

38
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,438
they put it forward with passion they

39
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,798
want to help people

40
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,959
and those are things that i personally

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,040
align with so that's what i choose to

42
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,719
grow

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,159
i also have been hobby breeding for a

44
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,560
couple years now

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,479
and then actually rizzo aka reached out

46
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,719
when he saw a male i selected

47
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,200
and i got to collaborate with him so we

48
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,078
have some stuff in testing

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,000
but yeah it's such a blast i don't don't

50
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,000
know how to explain how exciting it is

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,118
when something you make

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,319
gets uh grown by a friend that is in

53
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,519
need

54
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,279
um yeah hopefully hopefully more good

55
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,200
things to come from that

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,960
if you see i've got different sized

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,520
plants here

58
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,759
part of that is going to be when they

59
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,078
were transplanted

60
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,519
a lot of these smaller ones here

61
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,280
specifically are for the breeding

62
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,598
projects i have going

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,878
they are cuttings that have been tried

64
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,839
and true

65
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,479
and um like this season i found a really

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,719
nice

67
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,399
royal wedding mail right here we have

68
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,199
two royal wedding females

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,560
both from seeds so they are sisters and

70
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,439
royal wedding is from emerald mountain

71
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,039
legacy

72
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,598
if you don't know who they are please go

73
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,598
look them up

74
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,319
they're doing fantastic out here now i

75
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,000
am dry farming

76
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,119
and when i say that i just mean i do not

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,360
have irrigation and i am not watering

78
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,039
i did give them three solo cups of water

79
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,080
when i transplanted

80
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,959
and i also inoculated with mycorrhizae

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,959
and also used some super worm frass but

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,560
i'm not convinced those two steps are

83
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,360
entirely necessary

84
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,959
however they do seem to be happy they

85
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,959
might be

86
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,319
best looking plants in the garden now

87
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,319
you tell me

88
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,560
definitely very very happy cannot wait

89
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:08,799
to see how it goes

90
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:13,120
i plan on doing some fresh frozen help

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,120
friend and his family

92
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,439
what else can i say you know this one

93
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,919
got knocked down

94
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,199
and the cage sort of ripped open the

95
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,439
stem there

96
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,639
now i took curry powder made a paste

97
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,680
with some water

98
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:30,318
and put that inside where it was split

99
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,519
and it seemed to heal right over it's

100
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,639
just anti-bacterial anti-pathogenic

101
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,120
and that's something i picked up from

102
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,878
rising moon farms

103
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,120
if you don't follow rising moon go check

104
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,598
him out

105
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
and he's also a breeder he's a grows

106
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:49,359

cookies

120
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,560
i can touch briefly on what i did for

121
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,879
ipm this season

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,079
i leaned heavily on last coast plant

123
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,600
therapy with weekly

124
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:13,439
applications and once the pistols

125
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,560
went from lashes to more like palms

126
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,360
as my friend would say i stopped

127
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,879
spraying

128
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,520
and started to lean on these green lace

129
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,000
swing

130
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,918
eggs that are on these hangers here well

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,038
they were

132
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,038
and yeah

133
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,038
very minimal you will see some pests you

134
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,560
will see some damage

135
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:42,478
this plant

136
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,478
it's one that i really like looking at

137
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,160
it's really pretty it seems to be just

138
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,560
soaking up the sun

139
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,400
but this plant is black lime reserve

140
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,399
across the chem 91 death star

141
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,318

142
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,038

again

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,439
this tent does not have much going on

152
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,199
i'm not really sure what happened this

153
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,879
is gmo on the back

154
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,478
and right away i was going to lean

155
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,079
heavily in this tent this is what was

156
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,240
going to be my main thing

157
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,120
and immediately could tell something was

158
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,519
wrong

159
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,720
i let it go i sprayed with plant therapy

160
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,758
just kind of want to see what would

161
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,000
happen here

162
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,960
someone can chime in tell me what is the

163
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,839
deal

164
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,399
i appreciate it right here we have

165
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,279
another

166
00:06:52,399 --> 00:07:02,399
gorilla glue looks like it's

167
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:05,758
starting to show seeds here nice

168
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:09,839
okay this plant

169
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,560
is a sister it's another

170
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,560
royal wedding

171
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:19,120
but it has a totally different leaf

172
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,120
morphology

173
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,360
kind of likes to emphasize the middle

174
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:23,360
three

175
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:34,639
and she's definitely the furthest along

176
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:37,279
for flower starting to really smell just

177
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,280
really nice

178
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,639
we had a day of clouds and a little bit

179
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,319
of rain

180
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,240
and then last night it rained so they're

181
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,680
all

182
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,680
looking pretty happy right now

183
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:59,360
here we have another paradise circus

184
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,959
some of these big ones were actually mom

185
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,759
they weren't my mom's i should say

186
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,758
i had power outage for four days and

187
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,520
decided to do a round of cuttings and

188
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,639
put these bigger ones outside i thought

189
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,478
it'd be easier to take care of the

190
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,840
smaller ones

191
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,839
so far so good

192
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,038
sour dub

193
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,198
this one's interesting this is a bag

194
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,479
seed

195
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,199
and it's going to be valley girl valley

196
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,719
girl is

197
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:34,240
sfv og cross faceoff lg i believe

198
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,240
and so far so good

199
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,120
always check the lowers and everything

200
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,320
and so far

201
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:50,320
nothing to write home about

202
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,320
don't see any signs of

203
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,480
unhappiness but maybe i got lucky maybe

204
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,680
it just isn't unhappy yet

205
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,039
those things can sure hide

206
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:03,359
here i have two different

207
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,079
panama pupils that's mass medical

208
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,039
strains

209
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,600
we gave out some freebies last year my

210
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,799
friends

211
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,480
split the pack and gave me half and so

212
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,838
far so good

213
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,600
this one is obviously tighter

214
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,200
flower structure looks more like what i

215
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,720
see pupil pictures look like

216
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,320
so maybe it'll turn purple as we get

217
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,519
cooler here

218
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,680
and this one has more of a maybe a

219
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,080
cherry sort of a smell kind of a hemp

220
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,079
smell

221
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,159
it's also very pretty really like the

222
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,519
smell

223
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,519
also really like how the leaves will

224
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,278
track the sun if you come in the evening

225
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,320
it'll be just drooped down like it needs

226
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,679
water

227
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,160
if you come in the morning it's angled

228
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,599
totally sideways same with the evening

229
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,000
and sort of middle of the day like this

230
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,278
it's just all over so that's very cool

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,679
to watch then you know what guys i think

232
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,720
that brings us to

233
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,919
what i might be the most excited about i

234
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,839
don't know i'm just super stoked i'm

235
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:06,000
really glad i get to talk about it

236
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,760
so this

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,519
is unreal to me this is a test line

238
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,519
that i was very fortunate to be sent

239
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:22,240
and it is cashmere 22

240
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,239
across to a pure vintage afghani

241
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,838
how cool is that what do you guys think

242
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:43,919
genetics from middle east

243
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:46,879
growing illinois

244
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:49,599
in this dry soil like i said it just

245
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:52,159
rained but this soil really is

246
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,159
it's dry

247
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,278
and also another one i'm super excited

248
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,360
about is this

249
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,439
i wonder if you could guess from the tag

250
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,600
we got

251
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,440
b triangle pu i guess

252
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,879
it's going to be black triangle cross

253
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,760
purple unicorn f3

254
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,000
again how awesome i mean i give thanks

255
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,000

259
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,440
line

260
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,440
both test lines

261
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,320
i mean i've heard nothing but good

262
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,720
things about black triangle and nothing

263
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,760
but good things about purple unicorn

264
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,839
have not gotten a try either

265
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:42,319
so man i'm not trying to show off but

266
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,680
i do feel very fortunate

267
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,760
