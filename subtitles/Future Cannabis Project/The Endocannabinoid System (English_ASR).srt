2
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,480
good evening everybody thank you for

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,000
having me um I don't have a lot of time

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,560
so I'll just give you my background real

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,640
quick raised in New Jersey went to

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,799
Rucker undergraduate and then went to

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,840
Rucker medical school ated the weather

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,120
and came out here for internship and

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,320
residency and I haven't left been out

10
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,119
here since 1990 I did 3 years of

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,878
internship and residency at Children's

12
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:44,038
Hospital Los Angeles and stayed for a

13
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,960
year to be chief resident I went into

14
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,679
Critical Care transport and emergency

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,719
medicine after that and I did that for

16
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,679
about 12 13 years completely burned out

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,520
after having a child of my own trying to

18
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,079
be mommy during the day and doctor at

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,239
night lasts only a few years before your

20
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,920
endoc canabo system falls apart and you

21
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,280
need a mental break and during the time

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,599
that I took a leave of absence a friend

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,879
of mine developed breast cancer and her

24
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,640
husband called me and said we want to we

25
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:14,158
think we want to go get medical cannabis

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,759
she's really suffering with the

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,799
treatment and this was in 2ou late 2007

28
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,000
early 2008 and I was ashamed to say that

29
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,960
I knew nothing other than what I

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,719
experienced back in college which was

31
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:30,359
not MediCal at all so I decided and

32
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,679
since I had time and I'm I'm a science

33
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,478
geek I decided to do my research and

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,159
sure enough I was astounded once you

35
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:41,000
start reading and looking you will find

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,280
some incredible things it's criminal

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,040
that that I'm one of the few doctors

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,640
that knows this it's sad that all you

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
guys are here and there's are there any

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,040
doctors in the audience I mean come on

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,239
where are we you know so um I decided to

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,759
go into practice I joined a very nice

43
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,519
professional practice in Long Beach and

44
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,000
then ended up um buying Cana centers

45
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,879
which is um my practice I also do some

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,599
medical Consulting for a group called

47
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:08,799
ghost group and um they've been very

48
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,479
supportive so that I can keep my prices

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,160
down so that I can see patients for one

50
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,079
fee and then take care of them for a

51
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,680
whole year they do a lot they subsidize

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,360
and they don't ask me for very much at

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,719
all so it's a pretty uh they're kind of

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,120
a behind the-scenes group so we're going

55
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,479
to talk about the endocannabinoid system

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,920
I'm going to go fast if you have

57
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,000
questions at the end feel free to

58
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,919
approach me or um email me I have some

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,439
cards too if you have questions so

60
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,079
basically you have to remember that

61
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,359
people used cannabis for thousands and

62
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,879
thousands of years as a medicine they

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,800
saw it as a medicine and then what

64
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:45,399
happened in the late 1930s early 1940s

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,640
is that for political and economic

66
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,760
reasons mostly uh there was uh

67
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,518
propaganda against cannabis and it

68
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,399
basically got taken off of kind of the

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,680
medical uh formulary and was made

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,239
illegal and then fast forward to 1970

71
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,080
controlled substance act but in the

72
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,000
meanwhile in Israel in 1964 as you can

73
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,680
see uh Dr Rafael mulam who's still

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,360
around today doing cannabis research

75
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,400
he's really a tremendous uh contributor

76
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,920
to all of this he was trying to figure

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,480
out what compound in the plant made

78
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:23,079
people feel the psychoactive effects and

79
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:26,439
so he isolated in his very crude 1964

80
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,719
lab THC from CBD and from some of the

81
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,400
other compounds and he gave isolated THC

82
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,878
to young healthy men and sure they felt

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,680
the psychoactive effects he gave CBD to

84
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,840
young healthy men and they didn't feel

85
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,319
anything and some of the other compounds

86
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,560
as well and nobody felt psychoactivity

87
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:44,399
so he achieved his goal which was to

88
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,479
find out what caused psychoactivity but

89
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
remember that that was in 1964 you know

90
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,479
just a few years later controlled

91
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,560
substance act shuts down a lot of

92
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:56,479
research and we really didn't know how

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,079
THC worked for another 24 years and in

94
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,598
1988 scientists discovered this little

95
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:05,079
guy right here called

96
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:07,280
um uh the endoc canabo receptor or uh

97
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,439
cannabinoid receptor and initially that

98
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,919
was actually a a known receptor remember

99
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,840
a receptor acts like a lock and the

100
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,798
chemical key has to come along and

101
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,600
unlock it okay so scientists had

102
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:22,078
actually seen this receptor and they had

103
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,639
tried different compounds different keys

104
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,478
and they couldn't figure out what it was

105
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,879
so they called it an orphan receptor

106
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:30,038
because it didn't have a key and then in

107
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,199
another research lab elsewhere someone

108
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:34,560
decided to take synthetic THC and

109
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,120
radioactive dbel it and follow it in a

110
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,319
rat's brain and lo and behold THC went

111
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,879
every time to that orphan receptor so

112
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,879
they changed the name from Orphan

113
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,279
receptor to cannabinoid receptor what

114
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,159
scientists knew at the time very smart

115
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:52,079
scientists is that we do not have

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,039
receptors in our body for something that

117
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,198
exists outside our body we must have a

118
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:59,839
chemical key inside our body that works

119
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:04,400
at that receptor so it was in the

120
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:07,079
looking for how THC worked we found

121
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,758
basically the endoc canabo system now it

122
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,959
took four years you could see I write it

123
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,280
right here

124
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:16,079
1992 there was the discovery of the

125
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:18,679
first Endo canabo Endo from within like

126
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,318
endorphins okay and it took them four

127
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,918
years to discover it because it's a

128
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,000
fat-based molecule and they were looking

129
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,198
for a water-based molecule so it took

130
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,759
them a little while but they did find it

131
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,360
and lo and behold in 1992 they found the

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,680
first endoc canabo called anandamide and

133
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,520
then subsequently five endoc canabo have

134
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,879
been found in humans next

135
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,719
slide what is the role of the

136
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,839
endocannabinoid

137
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,560
system from

138
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:51,799
1988 1992 when all of this research was

139
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,038
taking place if you looked at how much

140
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,560
research there was on THC and CBD you

141
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:58,240
know there was just a few little studies

142
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,759
here and there since then it is hundreds

143
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,199
of thousands of papers have been looked

144
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,360
at because this was a receptor that once

145
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,879
it was mapped out they realized it's the

146
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,919
most widespread receptor in your body

147
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,279
and most doctors don't even know that it

148
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,079
exists most people don't know that it

149
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,559
exists in this research they discovered

150
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,560
and a tremendous amount of research has

151
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,038
been done just in the last 20 25 years

152
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:29,720
that the role of the endoc canabo system

153
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:31,399
is to maintain balance within the cell

154
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,520
of your brain and your body and balance

155
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,839
is called

156
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,038
homeostasis and so what the cannabinoid

157
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,519
system does is it sends signals between

158
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,279
cells to balance the neurotransmitters

159
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,758
so you can see in the brain it controls

160
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,000
and helps to balance cognition motor

161
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,479
control emotional response and motivated

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,839
behavior and in the body mostly immune

163
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:53,719
function but also gastrointestinal

164
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,279
microcirculation and the autonomic

165
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,840
nervous

166
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,758
system okay in this slide please don't

167
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:03,478
be uh over dazzled by it it's very

168
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,919
simple here's a neuron and it's talking

169
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:07,800
to this neuron by sending

170
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:10,240
neurotransmitters so dopamine

171
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,038
norepinephrine um serotonin and so on

172
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,639
and notice they have their own receptors

173
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,519
if it's an over me uh too much message

174
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,240
it's usually too much sometimes not

175
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,359
enough but usually it's an excitatory

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,720
message your brain is firing think about

177
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,520
anxiety epilepsy ADHD autism right too

178
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,879
much message actually disrupts the cell

179
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,639
and makes the calcium go up when the

180
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,479
calcium goes up this is a plus sign

181
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,720
turns on the factory that makes your

182
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:43,159
body's natural marijuana like substance

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,199
which then spins up here key in the lock

184
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,639
to send the message to turn it down turn

185
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,520
it down if anybody's used cannabis you

186
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,158
know for many people it turns down

187
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,799
anxiety it turns off pain now there are

188
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:58,240
other ways that it works it can turn on

189
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,319
things too like hunger

190
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,598
but but basically remember what it's

191
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,439
doing is it's trying to say hey cell

192
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,038
turn it down it's like me knocking on my

193
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,719
15-year-old's door and saying turn your

194
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,439
music down that's basically what your

195
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,319
endoc canabo system is doing and

196
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,560
remember that the receptor itself does

197
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,960
not know the difference between

198
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,038
your uh endocan canabo the one you make

199
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,878
within or the cannabinoids from the

200
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:27,639
plant and that is why many people can

201
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,000
achieve um medical use of cannabis

202
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,639
without feeling over psycho Ive and so

203
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,399
on which I I'm not against but many

204
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,199
people do find a nice balance because

205
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,879
they figure out the dose that just kind

206
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,320
of puts them right back in so really the

207
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,240
way I like to think about the endoc

208
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,959
canabo system is that you're a boat in

209
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,799
the ocean and you start to tip and your

210
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,879
endoc canabo system kicks in and

211
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:52,199
balances you that's really what the job

212
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:54,720
is this is one of my favorite quotes

213
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,920
it's by an Italian researcher who's has

214
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,839
done tremendous work Vincenzo demarzo

215
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:00,958
and it says the endoc canabo system is

216
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,640
essential to life and it relates

217
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:07,000
messages that affect how we relax eat

218
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:07,000
sleep forget and

219
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:13,319
protect so receptor location those

220
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,240
receptors are not on every cell they're

221
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,360
only on certain cells and if you look at

222
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,000
the slide and this is pretty well laid

223
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,440
out on the internet if you want to do

224
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,399
more research you can see pain memory

225
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,680
stress learning appetite higher

226
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,879
cognitive function movement and over

227
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,879
there I think that's nauseum vomiting

228
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:31,799
remember in the brain stem right here is

229
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,838
where you control heart rate and

230
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,879
respirations there are no receptors in

231
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,959
that area of the brain there are opiate

232
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,519
receptors but no cannabinoid receptors

233
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:42,119
and that's why nobody turns off their

234
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,000
breathing or their heart rate with even

235
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,120
the hugest overdose of cannabis it may

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,120
be trippy but you won't

237
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,639
die there's also cannabinoid receptors

238
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,959
from the neck down and actually they've

239
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,720
also found these second type in certain

240
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,559
areas of the brain and what's

241
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
interesting is this slide shows you the

242
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,278
density so red and yellow is the highest

243
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,639
density you can see they're everywhere

244
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,759
right um highest concentration in the

245
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,278
immune system so spleen tonsils your

246
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,679
thymus your white blood cells and

247
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,159
basically they Med mediate the way your

248
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,479
body responds to its environment so cyto

249
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,039
kindes can cause inflammation and that

250
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,440
is why we know cannabis to be a very

251
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,399
potent

252
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,600
anti-inflammatory they're also found on

253
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,078
certain cells in the brain the micro of

254
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
the brain just think of those as like

255
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:28,799
the pacmen that clean up inside your

256
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,799
brain they're not the neurons but they

257
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,519
are the cells that help clean up and

258
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,159
they also have cannabinoid receptors in

259
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,240
the gut um cannabinoid receptors

260
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,519
modulate inflammation and also uh they

261
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,440
mediate uh pain response in the

262
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:49,480
peripheral nervous system next

263
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:51,120
slide now in uh 2003 Dr Ethan rouso

264
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,079
who's a very well-known very

265
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,600
proliferative can uh medical cannabis

266
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:57,799
specialist he's a neurologist by trade

267
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,278
he floated this idea of people possibly

268
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:04,359
having a clinical endoc aboid deficiency

269
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,039
what if the same way diabetics type 1

270
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,879
diabetics don't make

271
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,919
insulin people with hypothyroidism don't

272
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,120
make thyroid hormone what if you don't

273
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,759
make your natural endoc can abinoid how

274
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,639
does that manifest and it turns out that

275
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:21,278
research just in the last 10 years has

276
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:24,240
shown that all of these diseases listed

277
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,039
here there is scientific evidence to

278
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,639
show that there's an endoc canabo

279
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,360
deficiency or

280
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:31,879
dysfunction that is May causing these I

281
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,480
will tell you that I have migraine

282
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,240
patient after migraine patient coming

283
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,920
into my office finding incredible

284
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,079
results fibromyalgia hands down I have

285
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,958
patients getting off hardcore opiates

286
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,919
and all kinds of pain medications

287
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:46,159
irritable bowel syndrome and I just want

288
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,838
to tell everybody that migraine

289
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:52,519
fibromyalgia and irritable bowel are

290
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,600
three um conditions where and I'm sorry

291
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,240
to the men in the room but male doctors

292
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,839
say oh you know she's one of those women

293
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,919
it's in her head well it is in your head

294
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,920
it's your end cannabinoid system ask

295
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:04,919
them if they've ever heard of that

296
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,759
it's so other conditions as well um

297
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:15,679
chronic motion anorexia ftt is failure

298
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:19,600
to thrive in in babies you have to have

299
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:22,599
a um normal functioning endoc canabo

300
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,440
system for a baby to suckle um anxiety

301
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,079
depression Parkinson's Huntington's

302
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,600
schizophrenia and the list goes on and

303
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,679
on and this is a big area of research of

304
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,199
course you know pharmaceutical companies

305
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,719
want to come up with a pharmaceutical

306
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:35,639
that's going to work at that receptor

307
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,879
but you know I say why recreate the

308
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,240
wheel Mother Nature has what we

309
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,639
need all right so I'm going to talk just

310
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,159
very briefly about receptors um the

311
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,839
number of receptors that you have can

312
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,919
change in response to the environment so

313
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,040
people who are sick seizures Crohn's

314
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:56,838
disease nerve pain sleep deprived rats

315
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:59,240
have been shown that in these types of U

316
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:03,519
medical conditions or Environmental

317
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,759
stress is your body makes more receptors

318
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,560
it's like your body saying Feed me more

319
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:11,480
cannaboid so I can get the boat Back in

320
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,679
Balance okay uh very interesting study

321
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,000
since someone brought up autism I think

322
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:19,198
this was uh 2013 they drew white blood

323
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,639
cells a regular blood test from children

324
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,159
with autism and children without autism

325
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:24,959
and across the board children with

326
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,759
autism in their white blood cells part

327
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:30,319
of their immune system they had

328
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:32,078
increased number of canabo receptors and

329
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,920
I'm seeing tremendous results for a

330
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,359
number of my patients with

331
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,039
autism so again the increase in

332
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,480
receptors is thought to be protective

333
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,719
it's like the cells are just saying

334
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,720
please send more

335
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,958
canabo downregulation of receptors is

336
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:50,319
the opposite if you overstimulate the

337
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,599
receptor what basically happens is the

338
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,440
receptor remember I showed you it's

339
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,000
sitting on the cell wall it can get

340
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,839
pulled into the cell if it's being

341
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,399
inundated usually with THC and so that's

342
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,399
how tolerance builds up because your

343
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,759
receptors basically hide inside the

344
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,519
cells waiting for the all clear and

345
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,959
that's why when people take a break from

346
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,919
Cannabis and then they come back to it

347
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,518
say oh my gosh it's so strong well

348
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,879
that's because all your receptors popped

349
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,198
out most people don't realize this but

350
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,000
there was a study done where they took

351
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:22,120
chronic heavy users and they mapped out

352
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,958
their receptors and they had very few

353
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,919
receptors compared to somebody who I

354
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,679
call cannabis naive who's never used

355
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,599
cannabis before and they took those uh

356
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,439
people volunteers and locked them in a

357
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,480
lab where they made them abstain and get

358
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:39,120
a scan every seven days and by day 28

359
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,320
they had the same amount of receptors as

360
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,278
a cannabis naive so I have patients that

361
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,120
say oh I took a 5-month break if you

362
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:49,838
need to psychologically that's fine but

363
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,120
physiologically based on your um cells

364
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,519
28 days 30 days usually does the trick

365
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,879
for you um establish your uh receptor

366
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,720
count to normal most many of my patients

367
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,879
with severe medical conditions can't go

368
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,360
that long so we tell them even 2 or 3

369
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,759
days a break in between will take uh

370
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,639
will help your receptors um let's see if

371
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:12,360
there's anything else oh um what I

372
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,799
wanted to say here otherwise is oh The

373
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,000
receptors can be uh you can develop

374
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,039
tolerance at different parts of your

375
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,278
brain so some people come and say well I

376
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:22,519
don't feel I still get high but it's not

377
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:24,919
helping my pain well so the part of the

378
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,600
brain that's feeling the psychoactive

379
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:29,278
effect is still working but the

380
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,639
receptors in the part that are receiving

381
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,519
pain may actually be developing

382
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,000
tolerance it's not tolerance all around

383
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,278
the same it's different parts can

384
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,078
develop tolerance nobody's really

385
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:41,039
explained why that happens

386
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:43,000
yet and then um down regulation so

387
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,360
receptors hiding in the cells can be

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,399
advantageous for those that require high

389
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,839
doses so if you don't mind me talking

390
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,278
about Sophie uh little Sophie who has a

391
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,639
brain tumor she's on high doses of THC

392
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:57,198
that's good she it's good that she

393
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,039
developed tolerance cuz now the the

394
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,719
Cannabis can work to fight the cancer

395
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,240
but not like wipe her out all day where

396
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,639
she's sleeping the whole day so she

397
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,318
actually has tolerance to that but for

398
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,919
most people like I said if you're not

399
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:09,838
getting the pain response that you want

400
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,159
because you're overdoing that's a

401
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,560
disadvantage um I recommend to people

402
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,120
you know it's very individual what are

403
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:19,838
we treating uh where are we going what's

404
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:24,959
the goal and so um for me I recommend

405
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:27,240
patients to um uh maintain sensitive

406
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,599
receptors and then I joke around that

407
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,879
I'm going to make a t-shirt that says

408
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,120
respect your your receptors um so it's

409
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,078
been shown that low Doses and acute

410
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,480
doses what acute doses mean is just not

411
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:43,519
all the time um actually enhances the

412
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,759
way your endoc canabo system works if

413
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,919
you feed the system and are nice to it

414
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,360
it works better and so it's been shown

415
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:53,159
that low doses acute doses of THC

416
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,480
increase production of your natural

417
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,240
endoc canabo so you may be deficient but

418
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,839
your body may actually run a little bit

419
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,000
better once you start using low doses of

420
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,880
C of THC it also increases the number of

421
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,240
The receptors it increases the way the

422
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,120
receptors bind to the THC so that

423
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,599
they're actually a little bit more

424
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:15,958
sensitive to it and then in rats it's

425
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:18,480
been shown that just low doses compared

426
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,480
with medium doses or high doses actually

427
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,279
enhanced the pain relief because when

428
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,919
they measured the endoc canabo in those

429
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,599
animals compared to the start of the

430
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,880
study in the end they had extra canabo

431
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,719
that they made on their own um so by

432
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,640
just feeding the system you can widen

433
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,679
the own uh the system actually widen

434
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,400
widens its own therapeutic window um if

435
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,480
cannabis use is below a certain

436
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,160
threshold you get this response if it's

437
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,440
over that then sometimes you know you

438
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,200
get into that tolerance

439
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,640
issue thank

440
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,600
you now um I always joke around about

441
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,120
this but the difference between THC and

442
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,079
CBD is very important THC likes the

443
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,359
receptor it's monogamous to to the

444
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:04,119
receptor okay CBD is a promiscuous

445
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,879
molecule I didn't make that up I stole

446
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:09,279
it from a a researcher but I love it it

447
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,159
works at lots of different places it has

448
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,480
some effect on the receptor but it

449
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:17,440
really has non-abo receptor effects that

450
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,558
really explain why it is such a

451
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,558
profound um medical molecule and so I've

452
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,839
listed here and I don't want to I know

453
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,879
we don't have that much time but there's

454
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,918
not a lot of affinity for The receptors

455
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,840
but it it modulates how other compounds

456
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,360
bind to the receptor specifically THC it

457
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:38,000
blocks certain nononono receptors it

458
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,599
activates certain nononono receptors one

459
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,599
of which is the Gaba receptor if you

460
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:45,279
know anything about Gaba Gaba promotes

461
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:47,839
calmness anti-anxiety and CBD binds to

462
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,678
that receptor it inhibits the uptake of

463
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,319
some neurotransmitters so your natural

464
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,840
neurotransmitters may hang around a

465
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:56,240
little bit longer it modulates the flow

466
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,798
of ions like sodium and calcium through

467
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,079
the cells um it inhibits the

468
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:03,759
enzyme um and this is wrong I wrote the

469
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,399
right the wrong thing here it inhibits

470
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,640
the enzyme that breaks down your natural

471
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,280
cannabinoids so when your body releases

472
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,080
that canabo and it binds to the receptor

473
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:14,558
an enzyme comes along and comes along

474
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:17,519
and breaks it down right away CBD blocks

475
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,119
that enzyme so your natural endoc canabo

476
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,918
can work a little bit longer at that

477
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,798
receptor and give a longer response um

478
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,559
very very important because I hear a lot

479
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:29,079
of people not understanding this you can

480
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,519
develop tolerance to THC why why because

481
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:33,158
it works at that receptor and the

482
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:35,240
receptor pulls into the cell there is no

483
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:37,679
evidence scientifically of tolerance to

484
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,480
CBD and I have lots of patients that

485
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,000
once they find their dose of CBD they

486
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,000
can stay there for a very long

487
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,919
time so I wanted to just include the

488
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,240
slide because this is a big area of

489
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,280
Interest right now what about the

490
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,880
endocannabinoid system in different age

491
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,678
groups right so we know a normal

492
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,880
functioning endoc canabo system is

493
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,880
critical for fetal development actually

494
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,240
implanting into the uterus you have to

495
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,200
have a normal endoc canabo system and

496
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,640
there's some evidence to show in animals

497
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,919
that if you if animals Mis carry they

498
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,799
may have an endoc canabo deficiency so

499
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:17,200
by giving them canabo they actually can

500
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:19,200
carry um pups to uh term but if you have

501
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,880
a normal endocannabinoid system and you

502
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,200
use cannabis you actually might get the

503
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,480
opposite effect so it's always the state

504
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,720
of the person or the animal that's using

505
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,279
cannabis you know we're not all the same

506
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,519
we all start from a different Baseline

507
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:34,399
um normal functioning endoc canabo

508
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:36,440
system is critical for Advanced Brain

509
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,200
development in adolescence you know

510
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,480
everybody I I've been interviewed how

511
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,720
can you promote this there's teenagers

512
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,159
you know I have a teenager in my house

513
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,600
he can tell you the difference between

514
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,400
THC and CBD what the indications are and

515
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,399
he's already told me I'm curious mom but

516
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm going to wait because you know what

517
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,440
my brain's good and I've said to him if

518
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,279
you get sick you know we're going to use

519
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,159
this medicine but you're not sick so

520
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,798
just wait and he keep keeps asking me

521
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:05,200
what age again mom what age so but he's

522
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,440
15 and so far we're good I told him that

523
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,240
I have like um a drug dog's nose so I

524
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,798
can sniff it out

525
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,599
so um so now one interesting thing is

526
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,759
that in children there's some evidence

527
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:19,319
to show that their canono receptors are

528
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:21,319
not fully uh developed so they may

529
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,558
actually be fairly insensitive to the

530
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:26,319
psychoactivity of THC and I will tell

531
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:28,158
you that my adult cancer patients have

532
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,720
way more trouble tolerating highd does

533
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,159
th than my pediatric cancer patients and

534
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,919
so there's no question that that's that

535
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,799
happens and then in aging and this is

536
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,278
very interesting remember as the brain

537
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:42,519
ages there's accumulation of free

538
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:44,400
radicals and damaged molecules and neur

539
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:46,158
what we call neuroinflammation and we

540
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,720
start to lose cell function we all know

541
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,360
elderly people who struggle a little bit

542
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,519
and what's interesting is that um some

543
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,399
initial research uh Recent research is

544
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,960
showing that um activity at the endoc

545
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,679
canabo system feeding that system

546
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,200
actually helps protect the Aging brain

547
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,320
and slows down some of the aging

548
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,278
process all right so how do you take

549
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:10,960
care of your own endoc canabo system and

550
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:13,839
encourage people around you to take care

551
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,919
of it obviously chronic stress impairs

552
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,639
your cannabinoid system by decreasing

553
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,400
your body's natural endoc canabo levels

554
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,520
so what I call mindful stress reduction

555
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,080
meditation yoga deep breathing there's

556
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,639
some evidence to show that that is

557
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,240
helpful obviously exercise with some of

558
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,240
us are programmed to do and some of us

559
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,519
are not moderate to high-intensity

560
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,278
voluntary exercise increases your endoc

561
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,119
canabo levels and there's some evidence

562
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:41,798
that show that actually the runner High

563
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:45,000
may be endoc canabo and not

564
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:47,119
endorphins dietary omega-3 fatty acids

565
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,278
so of course in the United States our

566
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,719
diet is high in the Omega 6 fatty acids

567
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:53,519
which you have to have but you don't

568
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,600
want it at a very high ratio you want

569
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,079
your Omega 6 and omega3 to be um to be

570
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:02,319
like a 3:1 or a 2:1 but most people are

571
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:03,960
like a 10 to one so supplementing I have

572
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,158
all of my patients that have severe

573
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,240
illness I get them on uh a dietary

574
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:11,120
supplement of Omega-3 and that's one of

575
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,599
I I don't tell people to get a huge

576
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,199
amount of supplements because it gets

577
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,079
very difficult to take a lot of things

578
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,720
when you're sick but that is definitely

579
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,399
something that will help the endoc

580
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,000
canabo system function better there's

581
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,919
evidence in animals that social

582
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,960
interaction increases your endoc canabo

583
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:31,400
system and then um there's a number of

584
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,558
intervention so probiotic acupuncture

585
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,400
osteopathic manipulation and uh kumin

586
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,359
which is in turmeric which is

587
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,840
anti-inflammatory have all been shown to

588
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:43,038
enhance endoc canabo activity and

589
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:45,918
obviously chronic alcohol use in binge

590
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:47,400
drinking decreases the endoc canabo

591
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,000
system and can actually affect it

592
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,278
negatively that's not a glass of wine a

593
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,278
night we're talking about people who are

594
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,759
overdoing all right and then the last

595
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,038
slide I just want to show you this I was

596
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:01,278
um honored to be able to participate

597
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,440
I'm not selling anything because I get

598
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:06,440
no money from this but I was asked to be

599
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,960
part of the faculty uh Dr Deborah Mala

600
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,400
up in um Santa Cruz who's part of a

601
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,440
group that I belong to called The

602
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,559
Society of cannabis clinicians developed

603
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,558
a 12 module CME credit and I believe

604
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:22,119
nurses can get credit as well to for

605
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,960
this um program and you just go online

606
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:25,439
and it's an online program and you sign

607
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,919
up it's a little pricey but I will tell

608
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,679
you it's worth every dime it's 12

609
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,320
modules plus a few extra modules and you

610
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:36,038
can go back through them it's

611
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:38,240
interactive um uh the uh faculty speaks

612
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:40,319
and you can you know hit play and hit

613
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,240
pause and do whatever and then there's

614
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,398
uh credits at the end and you can print

615
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,038
out a certification uh at the end

616
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:51,959
basically you know every um cannabis

617
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:55,319
expert that's standing out now um

618
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,360
including Dr Abrams Dr um Dustin sulak

619
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:00,599
in Maine um Dr Mala have all part

620
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,639
participated and it's a fantastic thing

621
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:06,678
and I'm going to tell you just in in

622
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,320
summary here that in my experience and

623
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,519
to answer one of the questions that you

624
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,960
brought up to what what's one of the

625
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:16,639
biggest barriers is that people who are

626
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,120
sick and people who have loved ones are

627
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,080
open-minded I cannot figure out why my

628
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,879
colleagues in the medical field are so

629
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:26,759
close-minded it is drives me insane and

630
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,360
I'll say what's an endoc canabo do you

631
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,599
know about the endoc canabo system and

632
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:33,278
when it's oneon-one

633
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:35,199
it's with me they're very open but as

634
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,960
you all well know there's a lot of ego

635
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,399
in the medical community and it's very

636
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,480
hard to break through so you know if you

637
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:42,798
have a doctor that is questioning and

638
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,919
saying well yeah sure you can use

639
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,639
cannabis and then they don't know

640
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,000
anything about it give them this website

641
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,919
say there's this wonderful you can get

642
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,519
CME credit which you need to have for

643
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:55,200
your medical licensing and they can use

644
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,278
this so that they have some basic

645
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,000
knowledge I find that most of my

646
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,839
patients know more than any doctor I

647
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,398
come across and it it's kind of getting

648
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:08,000
depressing and so we really have to push

649
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:10,839
uh the Physicians um by saying we need

650
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,480
you in this fight this is when I was in

651
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:15,480
medical school I was taught cannabis is

652
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,839
a drug of abuse it is not a drug of

653
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,319
abuse it is a very therapeutic drug and

654
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:22,398
we have to undo some of that

655
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,639
brainwashing so I encourage all of you

656
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:27,599
to take this website and to share it

657
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,330
with whoever you can share it with so um

658
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:32,399
and so that's

659
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:32,399
[Applause]

660
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:41,240
[Applause]

661
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,679
my limited understanding even though I

662
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,519
was Premed 40 years

663
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,960
ago um is that I mean I did not know

664
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:54,240
that we had an actual cannaboid system

665
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,558
in our body until tonight okay um it's

666
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,759
different than the Endorphin is what

667
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:00,359
you're saying right it is it is but it

668
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,679
interacts acts with the uh endorphin

669
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,879
system so it's here to produce when it's

670
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,679
properly working to produce a s a state

671
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,200
of homeostasis for us cor it is and what

672
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,798
it does and which I you know I couldn't

673
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,038
include everything but what I'll tell

674
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,158
you is that your endoc canabo system

675
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,119
sits a little dormant until there's a

676
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,799
trigger which is imbalance and then it

677
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,199
brings it back up so you make those

678
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:24,359
endorphins in response to a trigger

679
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,480
inflammation injury illness and that

680
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:29,519
kind of thing okay and so that from a

681
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,679
medicinal standpoint um when it gets

682
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,679
into a severe state of deficiency or the

683
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,278
presence of disease is when you need to

684
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,480
introduce external cannabis to to get

685
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,798
the system Back in Balance again yes I

686
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,558
wouldn't say extreme deficiency I mean I

687
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:46,480
see people who are coming yeah

688
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,319
sufficient deficiency right and some

689
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,440
people come in and say I have migraines

690
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,720
fibromyalgia irritable bow I know they

691
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,600
have an endoc canabo deficiency they've

692
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,679
taken 15 different medicines that don't

693
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,599
work and they say oh my friend gave me a

694
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:01,200
cannabis edible I've had the best in my

695
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:03,000
life well I mean you know where does it

696
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
work it's not magic fairy dust it worked

697
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,960
at the endoc can avonoid system so they

698
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,038
did their own test to figure out what

699
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,079
their deficiency

700
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:17,319
is El over there which

701
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:19,720
one hi I um my name is deay by the way

702
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:22,439
SP um I was I've read some research

703
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,278
where they've done um just research

704
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,278
where they've given people just THC or

705
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:28,960
just CBD and to see how it works and

706
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:30,880
they found that just TBD on its own

707
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,240
doesn't work unless there's some THC and

708
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,600
vice versa and I was wondering if you

709
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,319
might be able to speak a little bit

710
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:36,759
about the Synergy between both sure and

711
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:38,278
that's a great question because that's

712
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:39,919
what's holding up the pharmaceutical

713
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,519
companies from reproducing this is

714
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,799
they're interested in single molecule

715
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:49,120
the cannabinoid plant the cannabis plant

716
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:51,079
has 400 different compounds and Dr mulam

717
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,759
Who has been studying this for you know

718
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:55,558
as long as I've been alive he basically

719
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,200
discovered that each compound has its

720
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:00,720
own medicinal properties but when added

721
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,200
together it is very much much enhanced

722
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,159
and what he named that is called the

723
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:10,240
Entourage effect you need all of those

724
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,840
compounds to get the benefits so right

725
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,720
now we're seeing some pharmaceutical CBD

726
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,519
on the market uh it's from a company

727
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,399
called GW Pharmaceuticals in Great

728
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:21,880
Britain they're producing um a drug

729
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:25,000
called epidex for Pediatric epilepsy

730
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,760
they've removed all the THC now for some

731
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,440
patients it does work but not the same

732
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,200
we don't we're not seeing the same uh

733
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,480
success as what we're seeing with what

734
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,558
is called whole plant extract you want

735
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,360
the whole plant you wouldn't take an

736
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,000
apple and pull out one little vitamin

737
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:43,240
out of it you eat the whole apple right

738
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
this is Mother Nature it doesn't fit the

739
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,919
business model for pharmaceutical

740
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,240
companies and so that is why we

741
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,038
shouldn't treat it like a pharmaceutical

742
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,000
it should be treated as its own special

743
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:58,558
category so with that with that in

744
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,398
effect I've been

745
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,558
I've had um some friends who've had

746
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:07,079
people back East who are very very sick

747
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:10,720
and they're being you know whether it's

748
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:12,519
cancer or Crohns or liver whatever the

749
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,640
the the gist is is that they're being

750
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,399
given synthetic

751
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,840
marijuana Marisol or something Marinol

752
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,119
Marinol what Marinol is is just isolated

753
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,639
synthetic THC and they're not getting

754
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:27,439
the same results no and what happens

755
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,720
with with isolated uh THC is you either

756
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,038
get really stoned and it's uncomfortable

757
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,120
what we call

758
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,599
dysphoria or you don't get any result at

759
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,359
all I mean I had a patient tell me it's

760
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,199
like eating M&amp;M's he didn't feel it at

761
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:42,000
all the fact that they were saying that

762
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,880
they didn't even they were hoping they'd

763
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,119
feel something and some patients that

764
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,919
they got it some patients do get the

765
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,518
nausea reduction and the appetite

766
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:54,640
Improvement which is what it's indicated

767
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:57,440
for but if you compare and there is a uh

768
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,320
very elderly psychiatrist at Harvard by

769
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,720
the name of Lester grinspoon if you ever

770
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:05,000
get a chance you should Google him he

771
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,240
says anybody given a choice between the

772
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,200
two who's tried between the two will

773
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,278
always 100% pick the whole plant extract

774
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,480
over an isolated

775
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:18,558
synthetic so in your position then you

776
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,798
would you would not ever condone the

777
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,879
synthetic verision because you don't see

778
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,440
the results as POS I live in California

779
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,399
so I don't have to use synthetic

780
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,360
canas and I have patients who live live

781
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,599
I mean I do see sometimes see out of

782
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:34,439
state patients who are very desperate I

783
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,439
cannot tell you how frustrating it is

784
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,120
when somebody gets a CBD only product

785
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,919
because they have these stupid CBD only

786
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:41,879
laws I understand it may be a foot in

787
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,200
the door but politicians want to stop

788
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,360
there they there's millions of people

789
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,278
that can benefit from Cannabis and CBD

790
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:53,240
only cuts that down and that is not how

791
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:55,240
it should be and so those patients say

792
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,359
well CBD didn't work what would you do

793
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,278
well I'd add THC and try to find the

794
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,918
balance between the two compounds I

795
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:04,159
understand we may not want big psycho

796
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,320
activity especially in a child but at

797
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,880
the same time we can find a balance

798
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,398
between how much CBD and how much THC

799
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,399
that will work for that particular

800
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:16,119
person there's there's no reason to

801
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:18,158
discard THC it is medicinal it makes me

802
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:20,798
crazy when people say it's recreational

803
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,840
it is medicinal it can be recreational

804
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,558
but so can B it in and alcohol and all

805
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:26,558
these other

806
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,038
things thank you all right I think we

807
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,798
got time for one more here you want do

808
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:34,000
it take

809
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:36,599
it so I I'm sorry I have a cold um I've

810
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,398
done a lot of research and my

811
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:43,278
understanding is hemp versus marijuana

812
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:49,079
hemp has more CBD less

813
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:53,440
THC and cannabis has THC more THC less

814
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:56,398
cannabis so I was told that if I wanted

815
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,399
to not get high I should look at hemp

816
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:03,278
and hemp oil as opposed to cannabis okay

817
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:06,319
great question lot of confusion about

818
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:08,359
what is hemp and what is cannabis and

819
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,798
basically it boils down to the genetics

820
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:11,959
of the plant which nobody talks about

821
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,440
you don't hear about that in a

822
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,798
collective or in a doctor's office but

823
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,399
basically Cannabis sativa is actually a

824
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:22,359
hemp fibrous and cannabis indicia is

825
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:23,798
really programmed to make more THC

826
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,479
however everybody thinks it's the other

827
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:27,879
way around and so and there's a lot of

828
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,720
confusion what you have to remember is

829
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,679
go back to the Entourage effect you want

830
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,200
every part of the plant that you can

831
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:35,720
have and I didn't even get into What's

832
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,960
called the terpenoids cuz there isn't

833
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,399
time but you wouldn't want to take just

834
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,079
a piece of the cannabis plant hemp is a

835
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:47,158
very good nutritional source of Omega

836
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:49,798
fatty acids I encourage people it's it's

837
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,880
like a bonus nutrition product and

838
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:54,759
everybody should incorporate it hemp oil

839
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,399
hemp Parts whatever but I do not see it

840
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:59,440
as quote medicine it can enhance your

841
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:01,879
end cannabinoid system but if you are a

842
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,720
sick person you should be using the

843
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,039
cannabis plant that makes both THC and

844
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,679
CBD what you have to remember is that

845
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:11,519
freedom to grow cannabis in California

846
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,838
now we're going on 20 years of medical

847
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,559
legalization right and what's happened

848
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:19,878
is that with that freedom to grow people

849
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:23,119
have been Crossing strains and so on in

850
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:25,960
that um growing of cannabis what has

851
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,599
happened is everybody wants to max out

852
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,398
the high THC you know everybody like my

853
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,960
car has more torque than your car if

854
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:37,918
that even makes sense but it's more THC

855
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:41,519
at the sacrifice of CBD so if you go and

856
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:45,519
look at any uh test results of cannabis

857
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,719
99% of the plants in California are 20%

858
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:51,039
THC

859
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,918
0.02% CBD but what's happened over the

860
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:56,320
last few years because of kind of the

861
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:59,078
media attention to CBD and the and the

862
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,480
scientific knowledge that is come out is

863
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:04,599
that we now recognize that we need to

864
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,880
have some CBD as balance in these plans

865
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:09,000
and I find that my patients look I have

866
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,440
lots of patients that do really well on

867
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,679
THC but if they come in and say well my

868
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,480
pain you know I kind of distracted from

869
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,118
and it's not really helping and I ask

870
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,920
them what they're using invariably

871
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,480
they're using all THC with no CBD and if

872
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,880
we add in CBD they're going to get

873
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,880
better results because it's kind of been

874
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,880
bred down and now we're talking about

875
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,358
bringing it back so we've kind of come

876
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,920
Circle back to what Mother Nature may

877
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:34,799
have meant with some CBD one other thing

878
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,159
about hemp it's very important is hemp

879
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,480
is considered is a plant um that's

880
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:42,799
considered a bioaccumulator which means

881
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,838
that it sucks up a lot from the ground

882
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,000
and it can suck up heavy metals I've

883
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:49,078
actually had patients come in who have

884
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,559
gotten cannabis tested and there's some

885
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,400
nasty stuff in there the FDA if you go

886
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:56,400
to the FDA which is not my favorite

887
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,079
group but um if you go to their website

888
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,760
they actually have a list list of

889
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,318
products that are supposedly hemp CBD

890
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,560
products and most of them don't even

891
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:06,440
have any CBD in them because there

892
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,239
really isn't any regulation of what's

893
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,880
going on the the hemp that you would buy

894
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:15,239
at you know a grocery store usually is

895
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,358
is somebody's bothering to make it right

896
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,719
the hemp right now unregulated that's

897
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,598
available in some collectives is not

898
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,480
regulated you're better off just going

899
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,800
and buying and adding that if you want

900
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,800
medicine I recommend a medical cannabis

901
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,960
plant with some tested ratio of THC to

902
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,680
CBD what's the ratio it depends on what

903
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,199
illness you have so a lot of my epilepsy

904
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:40,679
patients use high CBD low THC a recent

905
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:42,559
study of patients with um neuropathic

906
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:45,399
pain nerve pain and chronic pain they

907
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:48,119
found four to one CBD is always first

908
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,200
okay so four parts CBD to one part THC

909
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,640
seem to work across the board for many

910
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:55,159
chronic pain patients some patients may

911
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:57,118
find that still a little psychoactive so

912
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:58,920
you could bump up on the CBD a little

913
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,920
bit I have a lot of patients that use

914
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,800
high CBD during the day so that they're

915
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,318
not feeling under the influence they can

916
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,800
still drive their car go to work take

917
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:08,318
care of their kids and then at night

918
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,760
they use a higher THC product so that

919
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:13,440
they can get sleep and relax and get a

920
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,640
little bit more pain

921
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,440
relief oh one more sure all right one

922
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:21,879
more you want to ask yeah yeah sorry I

923
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,838
can talk to you

924
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,280
after um yes my question is then is

925
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:29,239
followup to that uh when making your

926
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,160
whole whole plant extract how critical

927
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:33,118
is it that it's all in the same plant or

928
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:35,199
can you mix extracts from different

929
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,640
plants like say you have a a high CBD

930
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,078
strain and then a higher THC strain

931
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:41,000
would that still be the same effect or

932
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:43,480
would it be beneficial if you just have

933
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,440
a single plant extract so that's a great

934
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,679
question so the amount of THC is going

935
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,200
to be the amount of THC in that plant if

936
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:52,279
you add more to it you just add it up

937
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:53,399
the big difference is the other oils

938
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,400
that are in the plant called the

939
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,920
terpenoids which you may have heard of

940
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,519
when you're looking at terpenoids

941
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,838
remember so I'll just share one one

942
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,400
example a turpenoid is essential oil

943
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:06,400
found in the plant and it's cross

944
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,680
species with other plants meaning you

945
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,680
can find a turpenoid called linol in

946
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:13,078
lavender we all know Lavender is kind of

947
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,960
common linol is also found in certain

948
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,480
strains of cannabis many of them have a

949
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,000
name that hints towards lavender like

950
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,199
purple purple princess granddaddy purple

951
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,800
purple haze so sometimes the names

952
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,799
aren't just stupid they actually refer

953
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,960
to what the plant is so if you mix

954
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,880
though you know something with linol was

955
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,400
something with mirene you may not know

956
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,519
exactly unless you measure it you may

957
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,920
not know exactly what end result you're

958
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:42,440
going to get okay and so you know I'm

959
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,240
all for the regulation so that people

960
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,400
can walk into a collective and see how

961
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:50,039
much THC how much CBD solvents

962
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,358
pesticides and the turpenoid profile cuz

963
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:54,239
if I know I need linol I don't want to

964
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:56,838
buy a plant that doesn't have any linol

965
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,399
in it right so that is just just the

966
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:00,239
same way food food is labeled and my

967
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,160
doctor says you know eat more calcium

968
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:04,078
eat more fiber you want to look at

969
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,879
labels you want to be able to know you

970
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,440
know does Artic chokes how what do they

971
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,720
have I look on the internet and I can

972
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,039
see so it's the same thing with these

973
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:13,639
plants and this is completely doable

974
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:16,400
it's just California kind of got it

975
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:20,078
backwards we legalized first and then

976
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,480
didn't really regulate the way we should

977
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:27,519
have thank you

978
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:30,519
[Applause]

979
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,519
oh

980
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:38,780
[Music]
