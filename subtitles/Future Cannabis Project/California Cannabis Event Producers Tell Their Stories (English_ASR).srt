00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:23,350
can hear about your experiences free

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,850
regulation and how those events took

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,310
shape and what that was like

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,230
during this heavily regulated

7
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:32,729
transitionary period where you didn't

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:36,009
have really clear guidance until the

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,678
emergency brakes came out last year

10
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:40,988
right around the middle of November so

11
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:43,719

12
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:46,509

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,948
you're planning now I'm a cultivator

14
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:51,218

17
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:56,768
we gonna do with our events I was

18
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,448
throwing a farm-to-table dinner series

19
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:59,818
in Mendocino County for the last 10

20
00:00:58,448 --> 00:01:02,018
years I was bringing local

21
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:05,590
agriculturalists together to basically

22
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:07,899
share and you know promote local

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,310
agriculture so we have these

24
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:10,629
farm-to-table dinner series everybody

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,009
brought their wine and everybody was

26
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:13,899
having that just the best time of their

27
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:15,430
lives and we would have an entire you

28
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:17,530
know day where everyone would just bring

29
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,868
things to the kitchen we did an

30
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:23,079
impromptu curate and menu which was like

31
00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:25,688
whatever got brought there we cooked and

32
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:29,078
we served in a five-course like

33
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:31,089
fine-dining style setting like so of

34
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:34,239
course I'm in Mendocino we all you know

35
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:37,450
most of us grow and most of us

36
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:40,509
agriculturalists support our practices

37
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,939
of growing food by growing cannabis so

38
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:45,399
we were bringing you know our cannabis

39
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:46,928
to the events and we were smoking we

40
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,060
were drinking wine we were I don't drink

41
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:54,009
wine but everyone else was and we were

42
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:56,859
we're eating great food and you know Tim

43
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:58,509
Blake you know of course you know

44
00:01:56,858 --> 00:02:01,478
throwing the Emerald cup and all of us

45
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:05,379
every year we would have this just

46
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:06,789
amazing it's like a family reunion every

47
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:08,409
December like yeah all of us would get

48
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:10,679
together show off what it was that we

49
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:10,679
were do

50
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:16,009
and one day it just changed like

51
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,709
Colorado just decided to bring all their

52
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:20,060
slabs of dabs I just remember walking

53
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:22,520
through the parking lot and just seeing

54
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,939
all these freaking vans painted with

55
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,439
like you know just oil and I remember

56
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:29,870
seeing all these people just bringing

57
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,849
cases of dabs and then all the farmers

58
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,230
that you know the you know we've been

59
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,449
working together we're just like

60
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:37,399
bringing pounds out and that it just

61
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:40,129
became this thing like all of a sudden

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,409
just one day there's one day it became

63
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:45,379
all right to have pounds of weed and

64
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:48,620
slabs and dabs on the table and I looked

65
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:51,289
at Tim it was like like what's what's

66
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,719
regulating this you know he's like we're

67
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:55,609
just gonna do it it's gonna happen and

68
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:59,330
because every year it careful into that

69
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:01,280
point in time so we jumped into straight

70
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,989
into farmers markets we're like this is

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,590
this kind of happen all the time so we

72
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:08,300
started farmers markets linked to the

73
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,159
dinners so we'd have a farmers market

74
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,150
during the day and at night we would

75
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,549
have one of these really beautiful

76
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,709
dinners and he's usually fundraising for

77
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:18,319
a non-profit or a local organization

78
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,879
advocating for local agriculture so we

79
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,699
didn't really get into it like we're

80
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,780
gonna do this for you know publicity or

81
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:26,828
anything like that we were doing it to

82
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:30,409
actually support local agriculture and

83
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:33,290
bringing that into to Malibu I feel like

84
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:36,530
was our medicine culture and our small

85
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:38,870
batch cultivation Network looking for a

86
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,590
place that would honor that medicine

87
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,599
right that one spirit culture you know

88
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,539
mirroring or matching another spirit

89
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,009
culture the teepees and the medicine

90
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:51,139
ceremonies and all the things that we

91
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:53,929
had on site of the original exchanges

92
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:56,449
though days prior all the prayers that

93
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,549
went into the events to say we're not

94
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:00,500
pulling a permit we never pulled one

95
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:02,000
permit for any of the emerald exchanges

96
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,039
not one permit and people are bringing

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,659
down van loads a weed I'm telling them

98
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,219
to bring the rest of their weed and put

99
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:07,719
it in the

100
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:09,580
I'm gonna introduce him to the rest of

101
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:11,109
the people I know in Los Angeles and

102
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,210
like this is gonna be great but all

103
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,299
backdoor and all you know and all

104
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:20,079
unregulated and then Michael Katz is

105
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:22,899
like okay like January 1 2018 he's like

106
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,870
the fun's over you guys can't do this

107
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:27,879
like that we're fully fully compliant

108
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,949
fully legal and like he wouldn't even

109
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:33,550
like drive with weed in the car it was

110
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:35,199
hilarious like we you know we applied

111
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,610
for Ike the first events permit or one

112
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,219
of the first you know temp events

113
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,949
permits got it and as soon as we get

114
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,210
entered into the BCC I don't even like

115
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,459
we weren't even like really talking

116
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:47,229
about it was like it was just it just

117
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:50,229
felt like such a sterile weird

118
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:52,569
environment so we got out of events for

119
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,060
that period of time the farmers markets

120
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:57,490
shut down the the farm-to-table dinners

121
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,370
shut down of course the Malibu events

122
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:03,449
shut down and we moved into you know

123
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:07,990
trying to enter into retail and now like

124
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:10,209
sort of figuring it all back out so

125
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,550
Susan I'd like to know about from

126
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:14,620
somebody who started it with an

127
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,270
educational mission and being able to

128
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,959
experience the plant through a

129
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:23,409
conference how having these new

130
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:25,569
regulations came out really affected the

131
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,900
ability for you to showcase event and

132
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:31,500
provide both context and content and

133
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:37,389
where you see that developing in your

134
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:41,310
conversations with the regulator's in in

135
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:46,029
my case I'm purely educational driven

136
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:49,839
and some somebody has to pay for that so

137
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:52,659
I have to have sponsors that can give

138
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:56,139
them some type of ROI to help pay for

139
00:05:52,660 --> 00:06:00,070
the education I came from a background

140
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:02,680
of I was in Orange County Republican

141
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:07,870
soccer-mom leader in the Mormon Church

142
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,810
and I had I sustained a head injury that

143
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,569
left me with a migraine headache that

144
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,610
- two years long and I was going through

145
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,319
a divorce I had three little kids my

146
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,340
life was falling apart and I was never

147
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,709
not in pain and my neighbor was growing

148
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:25,918
weed in her garden and she said this

149
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:28,349
actually might help you and I knew that

150
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:32,189
if it did if it worked if I tried it if

151
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:34,379
it worked that I would lose my entire

152
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:37,079
community when you're a Mormon your

153
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:39,629
entire community your family your

154
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:42,839
friends that they will not accept you

155
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:46,168
anymore you know that was not okay back

156
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,209
then this was quite a while ago and I

157
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:50,909
didn't really have a choice I needed to

158
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:55,199
live for my kids so I tried it and it

159
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:58,350
worked and I promised myself that I

160
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,839
would make sure that I could change

161
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,430
people's minds because my mind changed I

162
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,739
mean I thought it was I thought it was

163
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,060
as bad as crack I thought cannabis and

164
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,759
crack were the same thing they were

165
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:14,819
drugs you know and I just felt like it's

166
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,430
you know just I have to do this I have

167
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:22,459
to I have to teach people and so I've

168
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:27,750
been very driven to teach and before

169
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:29,370
prop 64 I could have cannabis at the

170
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,110
events I could show people what it

171
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,490
looked like I can have big beautiful

172
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:38,509
plants all over the place you know and

173
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,949
invite in the the regulator's invite in

174
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:42,478
local elected officials and they can

175
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:44,279
stand next to a plant and take their

176
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:49,918
picture and they're not gonna you know

177
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:53,369
start shooting heroin mm-hmm so it's

178
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,959
interesting I've I'm trying to

179
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,639
rediscover myself I didn't know what I

180
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,069
was gonna do this year I didn't know how

181
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,769
I was gonna figure it out somehow I did

182
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:04,469
next year I don't know I don't know how

183
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:06,659
it's gonna work I do an event during

184
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,270
Coachella and I give the artists that

185
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,039
performed bags full of weed I can't do

186
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:12,859
that next year I don't know how it's

187
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,500
going to work out

188
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:19,348
so things need to be fixed we we have a

189
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,279
lot of work to do to you know just the

190
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:23,980
alcohol thing the premesis and

191
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:27,129
I was gonna ask you Pam you said premise

192
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:30,610
you said premise perhaps think so the

193
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:37,320
the permanent regs use the word premise

194
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:40,509
this 290 times in the word premise it's

195
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,060
well it's about context right so if

196
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:45,519
we're talking about the premise where

197
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:48,250
candidate commercial cannabis activity

198
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,649
may be taking place cannot be in the

199
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,799
same location where you have alcohol

200
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:56,919
premise then the use of the single word

201
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:59,079
is important so just like lawyers lay

202
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:01,389
over to argue over commas and comma

203
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,910
placement whether or not there are

204
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:07,360
premises right or you can use a premises

205
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:09,009
in in that instinct that's gonna be very

206
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,169
important and Susan you raise a great

207
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:13,870
point for all of you that are upset

208
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:16,689
about the events and the lack of

209
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,210
accessibility as you're hearing about we

210
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,240
have this wonderful unique opportunity

211
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:25,269
to comment on the draft permanent

212
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,659
regulations that opportunity ends

213
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:31,179
November 5th at 5:00 p.m. you can call

214
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:34,569
you can email you can send in a letter

215
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:36,129
to the three regulatory agencies the

216
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,890
Bureau of cannabis control the

217
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:43,960
Department of Food and Agriculture

218
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:46,240
comments on the Bureau of cannabis

219
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,280
control Laurie Ajax herself said she

220
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,379
thought she would receive a 1000

221
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:54,879
comments the last go-around she received

222
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:57,129
in excess of 4,000 so people speak in

223
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,740
numbers this is an important issue and

224
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:03,279
events access is and being able to be a

225
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,930
responsible consumer and enjoy cannabis

226
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,088
if you want to enjoy cannabis and learn

227
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:09,039
but also enjoy alcohol if that is what

228
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:11,920
your preference is and you are adult

229
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,569
over the age of 21 you should have that

230
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,849
right there was nothing that you voted

231
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,400
on that said that you couldn't have the

232
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,259
right to consume one or the other now

233
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,319
there is a responsibility and that's

234
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:26,830
both on the operator and on the attendee

235
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,230
to do so without causing any problem but

236
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,629
you can comment on that and help Susan

237
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,209
to understand and ask for clarification

238
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:34,889
on that particular point not to belabor

239
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:38,789
it

240
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:40,649
but it is important the same thing as

241
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:43,528
when your operators go to your local

242
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:46,678
jurisdictions and ask for them to

243
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:49,588
support their event please show up it is

244
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:52,918
is so important as I'm sure Doug will

245
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,629
tell you to have support of the event

246
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:56,458
that you want to do and even though now

247
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:58,109
we are allowed to have them not on the

248
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,789
fairgrounds that we wouldn't naturally

249
00:10:58,109 --> 00:11:03,509
go to the city of Victorville I'm sure

250
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:05,039
for anything ever again but you may want

251
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:07,470
to go to a different City and if you're

252
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,568
in that city if you were to show up and

253
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,609
there was an outpouring of people that

254
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:13,618
show up that would frequent the

255
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:15,689
restaurants that would frequent the

256
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:17,579
hotels that would frequent all of these

257
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:20,099
other ancillary businesses that would be

258
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:22,469
making money and they saw that support

259
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,359
it's going to motivate that city to not

260
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,399
only have a process but one that is

261
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:28,829
easier and can maintain some of this

262
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,859
great culture that Justin was talking

263
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:34,588
about so with that in mind Doug I would

264
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:37,139
love to have you talk about what your

265
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:40,110
experience was like for chalice during a

266
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:44,629
2:15 and then this most recent iteration

267
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:48,528
of difficulty that you experienced okay

268
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:48,528
how you guys doing

269
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:54,778
appreciate you coming out maybe you

270
00:11:53,249 --> 00:12:00,119
could raise your hands who's familiar

271
00:11:54,778 --> 00:12:04,918
here with chalice festival okay for the

272
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:07,619
people who aren't I'll start by saying

273
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:09,899
my name is Doug Drake up I'm from Boston

274
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:13,439
Massachusetts from the East Coast you

275
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:18,688
know in the building Red Sox you know I

276
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:24,149
don't but I'm not from the California

277
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:27,088
culture I am someone who has really been

278
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:32,208
blessed by the cannabis plant on all

279
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:37,309
levels in my life from my friends and

280
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:37,308
getting to know people and networking to

281
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:44,519
relief using the plan as relief are also

282
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:46,149
using the plant to make money and

283
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,179
getting benefits on of the

284
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:53,649
you know from this plant health issues

285
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:55,959
happen that's another point of you know

286
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:59,019
what a blessing I've had with this plant

287
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:04,750
you know in my life and the relief it's

288
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:10,269
given me and it's I moved to California

289
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:12,669
in 2011 thinking that medical marijuana

290
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:15,159
out here was a lot more legitimate than

291
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:19,389
it actually is or than it was at the

292
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:24,429
time I thought the you know from a East

293
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:28,059
Coast perspective I expected I expected

294
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:32,889
more like more of a control of it as far

295
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:34,689
as the medical side of it and when I got

296
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,730
out here being someone who sold weed on

297
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,360
the East Coast out of my apartment and

298
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:45,009
that's how I paid my bills and did shit

299
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,629
I just it took me about a month to

300
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:49,149
realize it was just a bunch of people

301
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:53,169
hustling and selling you know selling

302
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:55,809
weed out of storefronts and I guess the

303
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:59,379
difference was I mean yes it was more

304
00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:02,379
aboveboard out here but people had the

305
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:04,750
balls to go for it and just do it and

306
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:06,759
you know you'd get shut down and you'd

307
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,759
open the next day like on the East Coast

308
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,230
that shit's not happening and if you're

309
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,059
from there you know what I'm saying

310
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,710
that's just not like gonna happen at all

311
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:20,619
on the East Coast out here people are

312
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:25,210
cocky and they're about it because it's

313
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,370
not just a lifestyle or something it's a

314
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,650
way of life for people in California and

315
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,509
that's I think the difference that from

316
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:34,990
my perspective I've seen you know like

317
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:37,779
it's your much it's a plant for you it's

318
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,610
you knew some cousin or some uncle who

319
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,379
was delinquent growing some weed a lot

320
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,129
more so than on the East Coast where if

321
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:47,759
you knew a grower it was a big thing

322
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:50,529
well the reason I'm bringing this up is

323
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:53,649
the desirability for me to move to

324
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:55,899
California was how open it was right and

325
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,659
it was more accepted than where I was

326
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,279
living and I was going to go to jail

327
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:05,370
for being a weed person on the East

328
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:06,870
Coast a hundred percent so I was

329
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,860
somebody who went to the Amsterdam

330
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:12,659
cannabis cups when High Times was doing

331
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,389
them in Amsterdam and I you know like I

332
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:18,029
was that stoner who got out of high

333
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:20,340
school who went to Amsterdam a bunch and

334
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:22,589
went to the cannabis cups and I really

335
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,620
like expected this experience from high

336
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:29,100
times and how they presented it in their

337
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,929
magazine was that the being a judge was

338
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,960
fucking awesome I mean you got this

339
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:36,870
crazy experience how they presented it

340
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,180
and got to try the flavors but in

341
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:43,700
reality that unfortunately wasn't the

342
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:49,189
case and what it was as a money grab now

343
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:52,020
reason I bring this up is mmm it helped

344
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:55,680
sculpt what I created with chalice

345
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:59,309
festival is this experience of expecting

346
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:02,519
and experience as a judge and expecting

347
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:04,799
a certain level of you know a bar to be

348
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:08,490
set by who I thought was the ultimate

349
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,559
leader in the space and what it really

350
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,649
was as a lanyard saying you're a judge

351
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,809
so you look like a fucking cuss T out in

352
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:18,240
Amsterdam and you get charged top dollar

353
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:20,699
to go around and indicate that your

354
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,470
there is a tourist to get charged top

355
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,410
dollar for some bait-and-switch weed

356
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,420
that the coffee shops switch up when the

357
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:32,519
Americans and out-of-towners come into

358
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:36,599
town now like after judging High Times a

359
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:39,750
few times which I'm grateful to have had

360
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,300
that experience as a private judge I was

361
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,360
able to go be in the upstairs room with

362
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:48,329
Nico see how they run their competition

363
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,169
I was there when they developed the

364
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:55,410
first category for concentrates you know

365
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:57,929
I'm blessed to have have been there

366
00:16:55,409 --> 00:17:01,230
through this whole evolution of

367
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:04,169
concentrates and that's what really

368
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,779
stood out to me I always loved hash oil

369
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,818
from the moment I took my first dab I

370
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:12,808
immediately wanted to know how to make

371
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:18,480
I did that for years don't currently

372
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:20,788
make it anymore but what I created and

373
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,699
I'll start with just the judge kit to

374
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:25,528
break it down here is is an experience

375
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,230
where anybody if you look up here at

376
00:17:25,528 --> 00:17:30,329
these boxes okay on top of these cases

377
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,849
this is the chalice festival judge kit

378
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:35,668
now what this came with is everything

379
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:38,250
you could ever need to smoke weed when

380
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:40,440
you picture coming into town okay you

381
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,798
have got to go to a bunch of spots you

382
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,110
gotta go grab products you gotta go get

383
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:48,569
butane and a torch or whatever to smoke

384
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:51,000
this provided everything and it gave you

385
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,740
that experience what I realized when I

386
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,019
was a private judge for high times it's

387
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,240
all about the experience it's all about

388
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:59,250
feeling warm and fuzzy and getting to

389
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,409
taste the entries and getting to tell

390
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,349
people you're a judge and that's what I

391
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:07,230
was able to harness and convey into a

392
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:11,730
revenue stream for a festival to be able

393
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:13,558
to scale my festival up to proceed the

394
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,259
other events that happened in the space

395
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:18,178
now what I was able to do is build an

396
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:21,298
event based on everything high times

397
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:23,038
wasn't doing and I bring this up to

398
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:25,440
people who are considering throwing

399
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,740
events I think wait there's way too much

400
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,570
copying in this space and you know you

401
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,220
need to put yourself into it and think

402
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,869
about it and if you're not part of the

403
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,710
actual culture you're in have a real

404
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:40,138
hard time targeting the audience that we

405
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,450
actually are and I can say I am part of

406
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:46,740
it you know and I am a weed person and

407
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:50,370
on every level and well I might not be

408
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:52,740
running the extraction equipment right

409
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:55,258
now or growing or anything

410
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,240
I'm emerged in the culture enough to

411
00:18:55,259 --> 00:19:01,259
that my entire social group are these

412
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:05,970
weed people so I started chalice

413
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:10,649
festival in 2014 in the parking lot of

414
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:11,278
the National orange show and I went for

415
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:15,528
it

416
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:18,119
you know 2013 I started the 7:10 Cup in

417
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:21,869
Colorado which was the first concentrate

418
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,619
centered competition and it had my

419
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,049
business plan

420
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:27,509
of selling the judge experience that

421
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:29,849
would come with a you know complimentary

422
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:31,769
collectors judge rigged from the thing

423
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:33,659
and and really like put my heart and

424
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:36,420
soul into making the experience

425
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,550
unbelievable for people and it's cuz I'm

426
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,019
passionate about this shit and I you

427
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:41,720
know I think there's too many people in

428
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:44,609
this industry for money and

429
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:48,269
unfortunately it's got me to a place

430
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:50,219
where I'm fuckin broke you know but what

431
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:51,599
I'm not broke on is passion and heart

432
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,700
and soul you know and like I think

433
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,558
that's what separates me from everybody

434
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,910
else you know and therefore a lot of

435
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:58,950
people and I'm not gonna say other

436
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:02,220
people don't have passion but you know

437
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,410
they're they didn't achieve what chalice

438
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,839
has achieved in the space because they

439
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:09,450
weren't willing to put themselves in

440
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,339
debt for a cause and they weren't

441
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,679
willing to make the sacrifices so that

442
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:17,639
kit was fuckin unbelievable for

443
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,920
everybody you know and I did and I'm

444
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,890
doing everything I can to keep the brand

445
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:27,539
above water it's it's been a real

446
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:30,809
struggle running a business at all in

447
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:34,009
this shit with the laws changing before

448
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:36,450
the laws changed just winging it and

449
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:39,869
betting on some shit you weren't sure of

450
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:44,480
you know and this year it's a harsh

451
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:44,479
reality I was all in on something and

452
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:51,480
it's difficult to even talk about

453
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:53,610
honestly it's when you read the law and

454
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,200
you're doing something on my scale where

455
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:57,000
it's a multi-million dollar production

456
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,360
it costs about three something million

457
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,710
dollars to throw a chalice festival and

458
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,719
nobody understands that to think I made

459
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,000
money well actually I've lost you know

460
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,279
I'm it costs me a lot of money to build

461
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,890
my brand and a lot of sacrifices that

462
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:19,019
you know it doesn't seem like people

463
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:21,150
appreciate a lot of the tongue and you

464
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,558
know it should be encouraging to people

465
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,600
that at least there is somebody who

466
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,019
gives a fuck about this show like I did

467
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,019
because like

468
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:32,970
and you maybe I'm too passionate about

469
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:35,159
it and get my emotions involved too much

470
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,319
but the reality is look this hasn't been

471
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,710
easy to build these platforms in a gray

472
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,639
area market and when you talk about

473
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,259
transitioning this is the frustrating

474
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,940
part that a lot of you aren't aware of

475
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:49,440
so I was first in line to get that

476
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:52,289
temporary event promoter license I got

477
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,670
it I was number one in the thing I was

478
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:55,710
first in line to do that and be

479
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,990
compliant they gave me the option to do

480
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,269
it I went for it to build something

481
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,870
legitimate that was tangible right

482
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:05,250
wanting legitimacy for the industry the

483
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:08,819
reason why I didn't stay on the black

484
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,559
market which I should have and that's a

485
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:12,539
real thing and that's a fucking message

486
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,700
and it sucks to say but you know what

487
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:18,059
they put me in this situation to say

488
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:20,370
that is that I should have just thrown

489
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:22,740
it and not tried to get them tax revenue

490
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:25,049
and I think the state of California has

491
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:28,160
been incredibly short-sighted when you

492
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:31,049
talk about what they set out to make on

493
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,140
their tax revenue and decisions like

494
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:36,809
Challis is a perfect example of what

495
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,640
poor decisions this Bureau of cannabis

496
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:40,500
control is making for a small

497
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,990
mom-and-pop business like me to be

498
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,269
borderline put out of business as they

499
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,519
favor my competition and show

500
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:50,579
preferential treatment to my competitors

501
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,769
and you got to put yourself in my shoes

502
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:56,189
for a second understand how fucking real

503
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:58,379
that is because I deserve the same shot

504
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:02,250
that High Times or some corporation does

505
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:06,060
and you guys I'm sure not every one of

506
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:08,039
youse all funded up or is you know and

507
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:10,139
we're all on the rat race here and this

508
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:12,139
is a fucking some rat race shit and you

509
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,180
know what I'm not comfortable with

510
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,340
having to pay off politicians and do all

511
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,460
this scumbag shit it shouldn't be part

512
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:21,629
of it shouldn't be about that and

513
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,250
unfortunately it looks like that's what

514
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:27,540
it's turning into and I think it's

515
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:30,019
fucking disgusting and I think that the

516
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:32,700
one thing about cannabis I loved was

517
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:34,940
even if it was dirty even our pesticides

518
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,190
it was pure because it was the intention

519
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,809
therefore people of why they used it you

520
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:42,769
know and I think that's getting clouded

521
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:48,379
and I mean I could sit here all day and

522
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:50,569
talk I don't want to ramble but hey if

523
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,490
the next festival I throw is called

524
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:55,789
chalice or it's called some Mouse it's

525
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,710
from somebody like me who really is

526
00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:01,220
gonna make sure that the competition

527
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:03,980
ain't isn't corrupt there's no conflict

528
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:07,640
of interest and I mean that's a big

529
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:10,069
reason why my brand means something so

530
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,740
to everybody trying to build a brand out

531
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:14,839
there when you think about it think

532
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,420
about me and the struggles I appreciate

533
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:35,990
you I feel those struggles and I'm

534
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:38,509
fuckin here man so I take and smaller

535
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,029
events I've been I've been in the

536
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:44,150
cannabis event space since 2015 I met

537
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:47,750
Justin at a cannabis event in Humboldt

538
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:50,450
County at the 2015 golden tarp Ward's

539
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,009
and prior to that I was I was in

540
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,519
restaurants here in Los Angeles full

541
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:57,710
time I'm Zagat 30 under 30 Award winner

542
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,240
I you know I I pretty much had the

543
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:04,640
career that I'd set out to when I was a

544
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:06,380
kid and I was I was really I had this

545
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,540
eye-opening experience at a cannabis

546
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,300
event and I was there with my sister

547
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:16,039
who's my business partner representing

548
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:18,019
publication that she runs and it was you

549
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,670
know after years of taking the Greyhound

550
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:23,839
to Humble when I lived in San Francisco

551
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:26,210
and riding down with a 20 pack in in

552
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:29,000
some duffel bags and and some some dry

553
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,680
bags I was like oh my god there's like

554
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,829
something here finally there's a

555
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,810
community there's there's you know

556
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:37,250
there's a they're there and it was it

557
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:39,049
was because it was an event it was

558
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,769
because there was this community on

559
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:44,809
display and you know it was meeting guys

560
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:47,799
like Justin and and people that are

561
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:50,279
still in my life today and part of my

562
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:52,869
my cannabis story and my story as a chef

563
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:57,779
so obviously I have you know I have a

564
00:25:52,869 --> 00:26:00,729
lot that I owe cannabis as a social

565
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:04,210
lubricant as a social stimulant for

566
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,860
things that are you know outside of the

567
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:09,250
realm of what we consider classic

568
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:11,019
classic hospitality experience but I

569
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,359
think moving forward and and definitely

570
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:16,900
things that I participated in have

571
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:19,509
created you know a strong understanding

572
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:22,420
and myself and then people that come to

573
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:24,009
my events and that people that you know

574
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,080
read about them in the news and reach

575
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:28,599
out to me afterwards that you know

576
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:31,720
hospitality and cannabis is something

577
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:33,490
that's it's it's got a very strong

578
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,039
future and it's not like it doesn't have

579
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,630
a strong path to begin with this isn't

580
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:41,289
anything new that we're rediscovering

581
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,330
you know cannabis is much older than the

582
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:45,519
people that are responsible for the

583
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:49,289
stigma that's associated with associated

584
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:52,500
with it would like us to think so I

585
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:59,379
would say the main difference between

586
00:26:52,500 --> 00:27:03,609
what happened in in the 2000 the 215 era

587
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:05,410
versus now would be the I mean it was it

588
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:07,929
was pretty Lex it was it was very

589
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:10,900
comfortable and I as somebody that's

590
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:13,450
sort of this added value to cannabis

591
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,340
events where I'm doing a chef's table or

592
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,830
obviously like you know my bread and

593
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:20,500
butter was in-home private dinners and

594
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:23,409
still to this day like you know I think

595
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,599
I think I have a little bit more of an

596
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,560
avenue to do it in a legal space but in

597
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,138
the way that I've been doing it

598
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:33,979
classically it's not legal and

599
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:38,588
there's no true revenue stream for me to

600
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:42,288
to find a way to do that and have the

601
00:27:38,588 --> 00:27:45,168
state or the city or whoever find a way

602
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:48,229
to tax that themselves you know I would

603
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:51,649
say between November and sometime in

604
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:53,629
March between the transition I really I

605
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:55,218
took one of the hardest hits I've ever

606
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:56,598
taken as an entrepreneur it was it was

607
00:27:55,219 --> 00:28:00,679
incredibly tough and it took a long time

608
00:27:56,598 --> 00:28:06,499
for me to recover to the place where I'm

609
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:08,449
at now and because of that I was I was

610
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:09,858
this added value to people that were

611
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:11,298
hurting way harder than me

612
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:13,278
you know people like Justin that throw

613
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:14,838
big events that that it trickles down

614
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:19,009
and I'm able to support my family

615
00:28:14,838 --> 00:28:20,418
because and it's those big hits that hit

616
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:24,108
somebody who's much smaller and much

617
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:26,509
smaller fish in this game but I you know

618
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:28,338
I have I have a big voice because I go

619
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:29,929
into people's homes and I have that

620
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:32,088
direct and I can I can promote his

621
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:33,139
message as a farmer and I can promote

622
00:28:32,088 --> 00:28:37,938
you know

623
00:28:33,138 --> 00:28:39,618
Doug's drive to have flavor driven

624
00:28:37,939 --> 00:28:42,019
concentrates that you know are

625
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:43,938
expressive as a chef that that inspire

626
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:46,159
great dishes out of me and I can also

627
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:47,929
speak to people that are new to cannabis

628
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,519
and I can I can capture them tableside

629
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:51,649
and I can educate them and I can teach

630
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,538
them about things that otherwise they

631
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:57,018
would have had no other way and and that

632
00:28:53,538 --> 00:28:58,669
hurt for me is just an impact of what

633
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:01,278
they've been going through and what my

634
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:03,139
people that cultivate and what my and my

635
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,989
people that throw events and my people

636
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:10,008
that are you know part of every facet of

637
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:12,858
this of this emerging industry and you

638
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:15,139
know it's just it's the effect that the

639
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:16,878
state probably doesn't even foresee that

640
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:18,888
somebody like me who's taking this

641
00:29:16,878 --> 00:29:20,598
chance who's you know I feel like I'm

642
00:29:18,888 --> 00:29:22,878
doing good work I feel like I'm making a

643
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:24,708
positive change in this world and it's

644
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:26,328
it was stifling and it was difficult and

645
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:29,119
I'm you know happy I made it through it

646
00:29:26,328 --> 00:29:30,948
and you know I I see I see for the first

647
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:34,608
time a path with with these smaller

648
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:37,099
events whereas you know the struggle has

649
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:38,269
probably put a big impact on the people

650
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:39,019
that have gotten me to the point where

651
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:40,880
I'm at now

652
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:42,259
I did an application for a social

653
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,930
consumption lounge in West Hollywood I

654
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:48,740
am I am somebody that you know I like to

655
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:50,900
think that I have a pretty good idea of

656
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:53,420
how to incorporate cannabis into the

657
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,800
hospitality space and and I got to put

658
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,600
my input out there whether or not I'm

659
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,529
picked or not you know there's a whole

660
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:03,109
lot of consumer who 90 applicants 300

661
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:03,589
applications City of West Hollywood 48

662
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,699
spots

663
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:06,529
brilliant people there they're very

664
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,600
talented at what they do and if any of

665
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:11,389
them get their thought through it'll be

666
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,649
great and and having I was just in San

667
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,600
Francisco I went to the Barbary Coast

668
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,310
and it was an interesting experience for

669
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:18,230
me interesting there was something

670
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:19,669
heavily lacking and that is that layer

671
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,380
of hospitality and that's something that

672
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:23,450
looking forward I think we're really

673
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,760
gonna be able to see we have one more

674
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:28,640
person here who wants to tell their

675
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:32,140
story this is Danny who just did hall of

676
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:39,080
flowers which I think you went to right

677
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:41,780
so why don't we all right I went to your

678
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:44,569
event I thought it was very well done it

679
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:47,750
reminded me of what the Las Vegas

680
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:50,529
conference used to be was more of a b2b

681
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:53,299
experience you saw the exchange of

682
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:55,609
operators having true conversations

683
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:59,180
about the difficulties and how they can

684
00:30:55,609 --> 00:31:03,409
work together and we saw what a retailer

685
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:06,220
giving away discounted samples I will

686
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:08,840
call them so I'd like to hear how you

687
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:14,029
maneuver docks I think it was a unique

688
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:17,899
spin on how to do an event that provided

689
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:23,750
b2b and also consumer education in both

690
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:26,330
the Willing da a and a City yes so I'm

691
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:30,049
coming with the 15 years background of

692
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:33,500
fashion trade shows myself and one of my

693
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:35,710
partners I guess in the last two years

694
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,619
people came over and Haley

695
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:42,850
kind of Ashura kind of be showing I

696
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:48,548
really didn't made the effort to make

697
00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:51,278
the relationship until basically Green

698
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:55,898
Street I'm sure a lot of you know Green

699
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:58,619
Street Rama and Josh connected us and we

700
00:31:55,898 --> 00:32:04,168
decided to go for it so I started

701
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:04,168
researching that back in September 17

702
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:11,919
coming about beginning of December

703
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,429
November middle of November the

704
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:25,809
emergency rates came out yeah I had my

705
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:28,330
baby November 29 so as I'm researching

706
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:30,428
and learning I'm learning that hey

707
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:33,129
there's like no one even knows how the

708
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:34,890
regulation gonna be and let alone events

709
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:39,549
I mean there's no way they're gonna be

710
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:41,440
regulation for events and I'm just not

711
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:44,349
gonna even look into it I mean we'll see

712
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,798
what happens I learned you know what I

713
00:32:44,349 --> 00:32:50,500
learned and see what happened then the

714
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:55,839
regulation came and I have a have a

715
00:32:50,500 --> 00:33:01,319
talent I'm an engineer by train but I'm

716
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:01,319
very talented in engineering the law

717
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:11,079
right the regulations and then figure

718
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,840
out what I can do with that so the first

719
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:17,798
thing I did was look at the map of all

720
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:22,028
the fairgrounds absolutely and realized

721
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:24,788
that the best the best place to do it

722
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:28,089
will be in Santa Rosa yep look at the

723
00:33:24,788 --> 00:33:29,829
website so that arch building and you

724
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,980
right there and then that this is the

725
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:34,899
building with whatever that takes

726
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:40,960
look the space down and

727
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:43,890
that's basically I started the second

728
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,170
part was actually the regulation was

729
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:50,680
meant for consumer events not for b2b

730
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:53,400
event right so there's one thing of V

731
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:56,019
giving just free samples to let's say

732
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,090
consumer versus two trades I'm gonna

733
00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:00,220
want to try and potentially buy them to

734
00:33:58,089 --> 00:34:06,759
the store so mmm-hmm we had to work with

735
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:09,610
that the dispensary that you sewn size

736
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:13,420
about so basically samples for two

737
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:15,849
dollars in order to obey the law right

738
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:19,240
they paid the excise tax on the full

739
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:20,920
retail price of the goods where they

740
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:22,539
were all quality controlled they went

741
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,639
through a distributor sugar I believe

742
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:27,309
has a distribution license as well so

743
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,369
they serve two functions and it was a

744
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:35,070
very uniquely engineered way of meeting

745
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:37,449
all of the ramifications of the law

746
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:41,820
another unique thing that I think that

747
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:41,819
we were able to achieve was

748
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:48,929
basically allowing exhibitor to exhibit

749
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,360
samples that were not tested right so

750
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:54,030
things that were giving our sample had

751
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,740
to be tested had to be packaged but

752
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,400
things that were just on the shelf for

753
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:01,739
exhibition or okay not to be and we got

754
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:05,490
all that in writing from the BCC which

755
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:09,000
was very important to some of the brands

756
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:11,279
so some of the bigger brands have a

757
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,199
compliance manager some of them stronger

758
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,530
some of them pay more attention some of

759
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,239
them less and you know it's a it took a

760
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:21,480
lot of conversation sometimes with

761
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,609
compliance manager in the sales manager

762
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,300
marketing manager really wanted to do

763
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:31,590
the show but compliance manager we're

764
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:37,190
not sure if we are following the law and

765
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:40,650
regulation so that took some time and

766
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:45,450
largely everything worked worked well I

767
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:47,680
think also we randomly met in one of the

768
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:52,929
BCC events

769
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:56,460
Loree Ajax mm-hmm and we just told her

770
00:35:52,929 --> 00:36:00,308
about what we do and she's that Wow

771
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:02,769
b2b event yeah why not people and for

772
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:04,839
some reason after that it was so much

773
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:08,588
easier to communicate with the BCC it

774
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:11,078
was it was magic it was really nice to

775
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:13,960
see because I had some of my clients

776
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:16,599
that were there to see the conversations

777
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,858
that we were having with brands about

778
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:23,200
the difficulties right I think it was

779
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:24,909
the packaging and labeling regulatory

780
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,598
whiplash was happening right around that

781
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:31,029
time and how they were planning for the

782
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,890
the new testing regulations how they

783
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,480
were looking at phase three what we were

784
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:38,230
hoping to get out of the regulations

785
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,659
there was some really intensely valuable

786
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:43,449
and meaningful conversations that can

787
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:46,598
happen when operators are able to get

788
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:48,719
together and see what is happening and

789
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:51,460
really have that unique experience so I

790
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:54,338
appreciated that from the hall flowers

791
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:57,099
it was definitely different I think that

792
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:59,798
it provided the bureau with a sense of

793
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:02,280
all right this is how operators really

794
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:05,159
truly need to interact which I'm hoping

795
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,750
Foster's into the development of

796
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:11,469
protection of small businesses so that

797
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:14,079
we don't see this instead of seeing a

798
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:15,818
robust events culture emerged harkening

799
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,250
what brought us here right because

800
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:21,308
everybody I know including myself stands

801
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:23,769
on the shoulders of those that went to

802
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:25,690
jail or lost their livelihoods or any

803
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:27,969
other thing that happened is you became

804
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,849
a cannabis and that ambassador during

805
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:34,449
that time that led to getting the

806
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:36,369
regulation that we have today so that to

807
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:38,980
me I hope it's a signal and a signpost

808
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:41,220
that there's more of these events but

809
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,199
what I'd like to ask Justin is

810
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:48,608
specifically coming from doing these

811
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:51,279
farm-to-table dinners what is and how do

812
00:37:48,608 --> 00:37:53,529
those cultivators and manufacturers like

813
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,230
we saw from b2b who could have these

814
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:58,480
experiences they're no longer able to

815
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:01,240
have this direct conduit to the

816
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,670
marketplace because it's always going

817
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,558
through

818
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,450
retailer and a budtender isn't a

819
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,240
substitute sometimes for hearing from

820
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:10,449
the cultivator how that flower was grown

821
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:13,639
so I know that we lost the fight on

822
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:16,308
26:41 but how is it that you're trying

823
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:17,989
to infuse that through the Emerald

824
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:20,450
outpost that could be at dispensaries

825
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:29,509
and other exciting developments leading

826
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:34,368
into 2019 thank you you have made my

827
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:38,569
life so much more exciting because I too

828
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:40,338
have been a law engineer for a long time

829
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:42,558
I grew up on the east because I grew up

830
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:45,529
on two blocks off a ther Street

831
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,760
my parents are still there like I ran

832
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:49,400
away from home to come to Haight Street

833
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,809
when I was 16 so I was like and like

834
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,470
been always that kind of like in that

835
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:56,720
space and I love doing it it's so much

836
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:59,750
fun figuring out loopholes it's great

837
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,279
and Michael is a brick wall when it

838
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,750
comes to a loophole there is no such

839
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,548
thing as a loophole that exists with

840
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,650
this guy

841
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:11,809
you think and then you guys did what you

842
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:15,470
did and I was like see I was like told

843
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:16,730
you and Michael was I was like if we

844
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:19,838
don't I said if we don't do something

845
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:22,309
now we're irrelevant and Michael said

846
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:25,578
you're right you're right

847
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:29,150
and I was like exactly so my life since

848
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:30,980
your event has been I'd like every hour

849
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:33,500
by hour by hour a different conversation

850
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:35,510
with my business partner about a

851
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,239
different iteration of a loophole to

852
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:40,010
make and to make an event happen so

853
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:43,509
thank you I'm like literally you've

854
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:45,859
you've impacted my life and that's great

855
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,359
because at the end of the day I mean

856
00:39:45,858 --> 00:39:49,759
like the story is a hardship and it's

857
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:52,098
like fuck I just want to like man I like

858
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,540
I want to like you know like just crying

859
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,250
they call the fucking time we've become

860
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:57,349
grief counselors I mean it's like I've

861
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,480
self-funded I lose my house on Friday

862
00:39:57,349 --> 00:40:01,760
you know I'm saying like almost every

863
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,019
rapper obly and I look at it and the

864
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,490
money that instead of paying the

865
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:06,619
mortgage

866
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:09,049
we fucking rented the stupid Victorian

867
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:11,120
Inn in Santa Monica to throw an event

868
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:15,560
and my ex-wife is going like you did

869
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,900
what and I was like but everybody needs

870
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,940
access to the market in Southern

871
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,050
California and we're right there we're

872
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,269
this close

873
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,380
you know the retailers are happening you

874
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:26,750
know like they're there like they're

875
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:30,260
starting to break a little bit like this

876
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:33,980
could happen so like I think what it

877
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:35,900
comes down to is that you know we have

878
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:38,269
had to create those look those small

879
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:41,119
loopholes like okay no events right how

880
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:43,759
do we gain access for small cultivators

881
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,139
into the marketplace right so what have

882
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,760
I been doing for 22 years I've been

883
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:49,159
broker and weed that's what I do I saw

884
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,540
we so it's like so how do I continue

885
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:52,940
doing that well instead of going out and

886
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:55,250
getting a fucking million dollar you

887
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,690
know permit with vans and security

888
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,989
cameras and all of those things it's

889
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:01,639
like we can be brokers and

890
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:04,939
representatives and we can create a a

891
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:07,159
scaled model for a farmers market so

892
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,869
back there in the back you'll see what's

893
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:10,730
called the Emerald outpost the Emerald

894
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:13,730
outpost is essentially like a farmers

895
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:16,190
market in a box that goes in a kiosk in

896
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:18,349
the dispensary shelves it gives small

897
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:20,720
batch mom-and-pop cultivators every

898
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:22,759
single one of those brands is linked to

899
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:26,750
a mother and father a lot of them in my

900
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:29,330
children's pickup lines at school and in

901
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,829
that box there are there there are

902
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:32,269
people that need to survive through

903
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:34,009
selling their product they've spent the

904
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:36,170
last of their money and you know this

905
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,700
because I spend all day talking to the

906
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,950
brand managers and the people who are

907
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:43,129
now operating and managing these brands

908
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:45,199
a lot of times the you know the wives

909
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:48,619
you know it's like you know them and

910
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:50,689
we're you know that is their access to

911
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,849
market they have got to get retail

912
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:55,130
access it does nothing there's you know

913
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:57,589
farmers markets are great you know a

914
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:00,289
stimulus of a certain amount of income

915
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:03,559
the retailers have come out against us

916
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:05,239
they've shot down event spills I I can't

917
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:07,849
believe I'm saying this because I'm

918
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:09,229
scared to death to piss them off I'm

919
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:12,589
literally like it's not about paying

920
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:14,690
politicians it's also about like we're

921
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:16,280
in a fight with retailers for god knows

922
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:18,050
what reason and there

923
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,480
the ones that are gonna make that are

924
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:22,580
gonna allow us to survive because people

925
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,929
don't wait four times a year to smoke

926
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:27,500
weed they smoke weed every day they need

927
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:31,789
to go to a retail outlet that kiosk in

928
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:34,219
that model is our ability to get daily

929
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:38,869
access for those small brands to market

930
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:40,849
and I think that that's like the best

931
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:44,029
play that we could do on the daily with

932
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:45,440
with the events not not going on not

933
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:48,170
doing the pop-ups and not doing the

934
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,840
direct sales and my business partner who

935
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:52,760
I respect greatly not allowing me to set

936
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:56,960
up an illegal farmers market in the back

937
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:59,870
of someone's house and and and so we and

938
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,740
one of the think about the small

939
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:07,069
companies so coming from the fashion

940
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:09,139
industry specifically trade shows I mean

941
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:11,269
I've seen it throughout the years people

942
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:13,009
going in downtown LA and you know

943
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:16,429
spending couple of thousands of dollars

944
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:18,680
and creating in a line right

945
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:21,230
having the samples paying for booting

946
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:24,349
Vegas and all of sudden having the

947
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:26,119
business going because they came back

948
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:28,699
from Vegas for the quarter four million

949
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:30,500
dollar orders and whoa now let's figure

950
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:33,199
out how to produce it that's another

951
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:37,429
story but you know it starts there and

952
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:41,719
they actually that was my vision when I

953
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:43,460
started to my surprise a lot more of the

954
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:46,000
bigger companies they established

955
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:50,329
companies were the first one to jump in

956
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:55,150
but we are a good mixture but it's

957
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:58,420
exactly that I mean I think it's enable

958
00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:03,139
it's an ever branch to do business

959
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:05,059
without having Salesforce spread

960
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:08,539
throughout the state so it's potentially

961
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:12,019
can we just tremendously the cost of

962
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:14,960
doing business well let's do the haul of

963
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:17,210
flowers and and Justin with the Emerald

964
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,429
outpost I think what you're seeing is

965
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:22,579
the one thing that I truly value so much

966
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:24,769
about the industry and even Doug and

967
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,929
Susan with reinventing yourselves and

968
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:29,900
getting back to what that true part of

969
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:31,879
cannabis is and that's

970
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,889
innovative increase more thing real

971
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,110
quick it's hilarious

972
00:44:33,889 --> 00:44:39,199
three weeks ago I rented out the rain

973
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:42,980
gallery and through a fashion show you

974
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:45,379
did want look at your skill set growing

975
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,389
pajamas so they talk about reinventing

976
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,430
yourself but I mean it's biomaterials

977
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:51,710
materials from the waste stream is like

978
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:55,869
super hippie but it was still a fashion

979
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:58,400
show so maybe you're just like systemic

980
00:44:55,869 --> 00:45:00,559
the vibes got to you and you're just

981
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,519
gonna take on all the personalities I

982
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:03,409
love it

983
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:06,980
but that that is the true ism of

984
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:09,649
cannabis that it is breeds reinvention

985
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:12,469
it breeds needing to be creative there

986
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:17,110
are legal loopholes that should

987
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:18,799
consistently in this space be

988
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:21,079
manipulated but they should all be

989
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:26,300
utilized because through those loopholes

990
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:29,210
the BCC sees the value in how we get to

991
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:31,070
better events right sometimes they have

992
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:34,970
to get out of their own way just as

993
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:36,980
operators do it's difficult to play by a

994
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:39,649
playbook that you don't know that's

995
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:42,800
continuously changing but if you go into

996
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:46,010
it with an adaptive mindset I think you

997
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,980
got to look always at your location what

998
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:51,440
you're gonna be doing and how favorable

999
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:55,969
that jurisdiction is to you but since

1000
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,409
we've got such an array of operators do

1001
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:59,750
you want to see if anybody has any

1002
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:03,049
specific question when you were saying

1003
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:05,510
that you wish you hadn't gone through

1004
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:09,500
the regulation process if you could

1005
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:12,650
elaborate on some of the some of the

1006
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:15,289
pain points they're through through the

1007
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,610
point that you know going through those

1008
00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:18,710
regulations we're in a similar position

1009
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:22,809
or were on the fence going through

1010
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:22,809
regulations or private events

1011
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:31,919
I mean in a really direct sense it's a

1012
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:37,828
great question the reason I said that is

1013
00:46:31,918 --> 00:46:41,489
because I don't feel based on the bcc's

1014
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:43,709
actions this year this is my problem and

1015
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:44,969
and I don't know I don't know you I have

1016
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:49,498
a lot respect for you

1017
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:53,668
you know I'll shake your hand he met

1018
00:46:49,498 --> 00:46:56,698
Laurie Ajax so his it seemed like his

1019
00:46:53,668 --> 00:46:58,438
event was pretty streamlined so I got to

1020
00:46:56,699 --> 00:47:00,778
go meet Laurie Ajax and get all

1021
00:46:58,438 --> 00:47:02,818
political to fucking give me the same

1022
00:47:00,778 --> 00:47:07,108
opportunity as other people do I think

1023
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:09,869
that's bullshit and I'm upset and I'd

1024
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:12,598
say it right to her I'm furious I tried

1025
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:14,519
to meet with her I have in a fucking

1026
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,469
email that I tried to meet with her she

1027
00:47:14,518 --> 00:47:21,238
met with high times she met with emerald

1028
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:25,349
cup she didn't meet with me that's not

1029
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:28,228
fair and you know what I should have

1030
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:30,900
thrown a black market event and what I'd

1031
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:32,908
say to people is don't bank on this shit

1032
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,709
because you know what they can pull out

1033
00:47:32,909 --> 00:47:39,390
the fucking rug from you at any point

1034
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:41,399
and unless you're ready to grease the

1035
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:44,068
right people's pockets I don't see how

1036
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:47,608
you got a fair chance what I was gonna

1037
00:47:44,068 --> 00:47:50,389
say is I got no faith in the BCC that's

1038
00:47:47,608 --> 00:47:52,679
why I don't think you should go legal

1039
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:55,108
unless you've got the money to pay to

1040
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:57,298
play and that's all these new guys

1041
00:47:55,108 --> 00:47:59,038
coming in that have no real roots in the

1042
00:47:57,298 --> 00:48:03,409
cannabis industry but want the money

1043
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:05,880
from it coming up with witty shit and a

1044
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:08,729
stick with your heart and you know what

1045
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,259
stay true to your culture and all these

1046
00:48:08,728 --> 00:48:11,879
people fronting like they have the

1047
00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:16,168
culture's best interest in mind they

1048
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:17,939
don't and I don't know what next year

1049
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:19,679
brings and I'm sure it's gonna be a

1050
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:21,149
bunch of raids and a bunch of people

1051
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,278
going to jail because that's how they

1052
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,979
set it up and it wasn't easy for us all

1053
00:48:23,278 --> 00:48:28,139
to transition and that wasn't fair and

1054
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:30,328
they didn't have anybody involved who

1055
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:35,098
had any knowledge of the crafts culture

1056
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:36,659
or what it was to use that plant to put

1057
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,240
food on your fucking plate for your

1058
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:40,210
family

1059
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:43,719
or your future or to pay your bills or

1060
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:45,550
your mortgage and what it created is I'm

1061
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:49,269
here at this coffee shop and I have

1062
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:51,280
people who come in here as members that

1063
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:53,199
genuinely say I was going to the

1064
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,110
dispensary for a while but I can't do

1065
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:58,118
that anymore because it just doesn't

1066
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:01,180
make financial sense the taxes are too

1067
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:04,750
high this shit got it just wasn't right

1068
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:08,009
so when you're throwing an event I put a

1069
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:10,420
lot of money out there and I got fucked

1070
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:13,710
because I didn't have the extra money to

1071
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:16,539
pay the right people or something and

1072
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:19,240
who's to say that my competition didn't

1073
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:21,000
try to stain that this is the corrupt

1074
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:23,769
world we live in

1075
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,090
so when you're getting ready to throw an

1076
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:26,920
event you got to be aware of the

1077
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:29,460
politics in your area before you're

1078
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:32,050
investing a lot of money into this shit

1079
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:36,130
or you're gonna get left like me and a

1080
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:38,680
bunch of debt trying to be ambitious so

1081
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:42,608
it couldn't be any more real than that

1082
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:47,039
like this plant really has changed my

1083
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:49,989
world and it seems like you have these

1084
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:53,500
Outsiders and this new classification a

1085
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:55,419
person who's fucking greedy and money

1086
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:58,300
hungry and it's not about the same

1087
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:00,070
things and that's real and you know if I

1088
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,539
speak up on this I don't really give a

1089
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:03,700
fuck anymore because no one else is

1090
00:50:01,539 --> 00:50:07,420
speaking up on this shit and everybody's

1091
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:09,460
coward to put it out there that the

1092
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:12,340
issues with the BCC stem from they're

1093
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:16,119
poor decisions and their approach on

1094
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:19,930
shit and I have put my comment in you

1095
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:22,900
know okay you gotta speak up when when

1096
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:24,759
they say you can but why is someone able

1097
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,880
to get their license expedited because

1098
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,190
they know somebody there how is that

1099
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,140
fair for you man that putting a mortgage

1100
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:36,220
on your house or taking your family's

1101
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:37,480
money to try to build a business and I

1102
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:43,149
don't think it's a level playing field

1103
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:45,550
for any of the platform's so again

1104
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:48,460
that's the best way I could answer that

1105
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:49,260
I think amen there's a lot of heart and

1106
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,809
love into

1107
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,580
people who grow this plant for the

1108
00:50:51,809 --> 00:50:55,529
reasons they always have and they that

1109
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:57,269
won't change for a lot of people you

1110
00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:05,160
know and always buy my weed on the black

1111
00:50:57,269 --> 00:51:09,050
market and period so that's in first I

1112
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:11,670
think it's important to say that I I

1113
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:15,960
empathize and I appreciate the

1114
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:18,900
difficulty of gaining a foothold in a

1115
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:23,780
heavily regulated market I spend a great

1116
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:26,910
deal of my time having very upsetting

1117
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:29,820
conversations you know the it's a joke

1118
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:32,609
in the office but it's true killing

1119
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:36,140
dreams is a daily occurrence for my

1120
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:40,590
practice I do that not because I want to

1121
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:43,739
but because my goal is to tell people

1122
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:46,350
the realistic truth of entering a

1123
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:48,989
regulated market and what you can and

1124
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:51,299
cannot do right and how you can and

1125
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:54,209
cannot get there and how you develop a

1126
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:57,240
pathway towards compliance and a pathway

1127
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:59,490
towards compliance is riddled with pain

1128
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:02,729
points and with cost and with

1129
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:05,689
complications and with challenges but

1130
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:09,990
that is never an excuse to conduct

1131
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:13,740
illegal activity because the only thing

1132
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:16,859
that illegal activity baguettes is the

1133
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:20,819
stereotypes that everybody in this room

1134
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:24,960
I am assured is fighting to not have on

1135
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:28,769
their backs I am a responsible cannabis

1136
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:31,800
consumer I am an attorney I use it for

1137
00:52:28,769 --> 00:52:34,139
my debilitating migraines that almost

1138
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,769
took me out on disability from being

1139
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:40,889
able to work I do not and I personally

1140
00:52:37,769 --> 00:52:43,409
will not endorse that there is an

1141
00:52:40,889 --> 00:52:45,659
alternative that is conducting

1142
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:49,769
commercial legal commercial activity on

1143
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:53,219
the illicit market if we want to see

1144
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:56,130
federal legalization if we want to see

1145
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:58,649
the ability for these walls to come down

1146
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:01,530
for economies of scale to be allowed to

1147
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:05,240
happen to have better access

1148
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:08,670
to have more events to continue to have

1149
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:11,969
the rights and privileges that we have

1150
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:14,940
than we need to respect them and the

1151
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:17,159
second that you do not respect them then

1152
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:19,860
you will have hostility from those

1153
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:23,429
agencies and everybody else will as well

1154
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:25,980
there is and we've seen it in every

1155
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:28,710
other industry corruption we have seen

1156
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,449
it in every other industry money is a

1157
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:33,389
pay-to-play situation there is no

1158
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:37,109
situation in life unfortunately that is

1159
00:53:33,389 --> 00:53:39,929
not pay to play so whereas I empathize I

1160
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:42,690
truly would love to be able to say that

1161
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:45,480
there is a pathway for everyone but as

1162
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:48,720
you've seen that Justin Susan Holden

1163
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:52,590
Danny everybody is working to carve out

1164
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:55,079
that pathway do exactly what Doug said

1165
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:59,280
to you look at these jurisdictions there

1166
00:53:55,079 --> 00:54:02,130
is 482 cities and 58 counties in the

1167
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,130
great state of California some of them

1168
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:09,019
are welcome we love you cannabis please

1169
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:12,059
come in resurrect our cities we have a

1170
00:54:09,019 --> 00:54:15,329
population that voted higher than the

1171
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:17,579
state's average population on 64 we want

1172
00:54:15,329 --> 00:54:20,929
to regulate and then there are some

1173
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:27,329
cities that have a tried-and-true

1174
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:29,519
tradition of opposing cannabis that had

1175
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:32,549
higher than the above the average of no

1176
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:35,639
votes that had urgency ordinances with

1177
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:39,690
expressed bans on everything as an

1178
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:42,299
operator it is incumbent upon you to do

1179
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,440
your due diligence and hire others to

1180
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:47,370
help you do that

1181
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,349
you are your own best advocate you are

1182
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:52,409
the one that's going to foot the bill at

1183
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:54,989
the end of the day so as these cities

1184
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:58,769
start to take shape as more data points

1185
00:54:54,989 --> 00:55:00,839
are available go to them as I said if

1186
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:03,929
you want to throw an event under two

1187
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,720
under 2020 on January 1 or in the new

1188
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:08,339
year go to them now and say you know

1189
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:10,230
what you are interested in regulating

1190
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:13,050
let me show you what a compliant event

1191
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:13,760
can be as Danny said he started a year a

1192
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,920
year

1193
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,720
or he wanted to have the event he was

1194
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,210
thinking about planning it and the first

1195
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:23,689
thing he said is I educated myself in an

1196
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:26,360
industry that I didn't know information

1197
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:30,200
especially in this space is your

1198
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:33,050
greatest ally if you go into a city and

1199
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:35,449
you say here's how to be compliant I

1200
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:37,280
already went and got my event organizer

1201
00:55:35,449 --> 00:55:40,579
license so you know that I've already

1202
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,740
been cleared by the BCC that my

1203
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:46,130
background is clear that I went through

1204
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:48,139
and tried to show you credibility then I

1205
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:50,150
went and sourced a location and that

1206
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:52,730
location is supportive of the event that

1207
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:54,410
I want to do I went and found brands

1208
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:56,389
that are gonna support me that have a

1209
00:55:54,409 --> 00:55:58,940
license that are license holders and

1210
00:55:56,389 --> 00:56:00,650
compliant and you package that up and

1211
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,780
I'm sure Danny can speak to this and you

1212
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:04,940
go to the city and you tell them what

1213
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:07,580
you want to do you get them interested

1214
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:10,010
they become your ally they go to the BCC

1215
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:12,559
for you part of what happened with High

1216
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:15,200
Times is Joe Devlin the pots are in

1217
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:18,920
Sacramento was supportive of that effort

1218
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:21,529
and went to Laurie and to the BCC and

1219
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:24,590
said this was important that's not

1220
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:27,470
corruption that's called a city gaining

1221
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:30,230
an ROI and an already favorable City who

1222
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:34,029
was regulating other parts of the supply

1223
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:37,219
chain did it go over without a hitch no

1224
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:38,960
right none of them do but every single

1225
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:41,389
time is a learning lesson and an

1226
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,720
opportunity and if there is one thing

1227
00:56:41,389 --> 00:56:47,739
that I can leave you with is please do

1228
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:51,139
not give the opposition in these cities

1229
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:53,599
exactly what they're asking for which is

1230
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:58,369
to point and say there's conducting

1231
00:56:53,599 --> 00:57:01,819
illegal activity so not to be a debbie

1232
00:56:58,369 --> 00:57:04,039
downer with the law but I yeah I am and

1233
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:06,200
I'm a lawyer I am an officer of the

1234
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:10,099
court I am a cannabis consumer and I

1235
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:12,529
just it's hard and I don't take that

1236
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:15,079
away from anybody and I don't like

1237
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:18,260
telling people no that's not my favorite

1238
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:20,809
thing to do but it is actually my job

1239
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:24,340
how many of you guys have already

1240
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:24,340
produced a cannabis event

1241
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:31,530
how many of you have a an event license

1242
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:34,710
from the state how many of you are

1243
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:41,040
looking to get an event license in 2019

1244
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:42,690
I would love to help you truly that

1245
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,849
shows me that you want to be a good

1246
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,500
steward of the industry and everybody in

1247
00:57:44,849 --> 00:57:53,670
this room should thank you how many of

1248
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:55,829
you how many of you that are planning on

1249
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,550
having private events know exactly what

1250
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:58,980
that means

1251
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:05,610
would you like me to explain the

1252
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:07,949
difference if you are going to have a

1253
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:10,559
dinner party in your private home and

1254
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:13,889
you are not going to be selling cannabis

1255
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:16,710
because you as 21 year olds consumers as

1256
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:18,809
21 year olds you can engage I can give

1257
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:22,190
you a gift you take one of these things

1258
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:25,739
from Susan and throw it out it's gift

1259
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:27,059
there you now what you do want to be

1260
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:28,919
concerned about if you're having a

1261
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:30,869
private event in your home and you are

1262
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,880
smoking is if smoke wafts over to

1263
00:58:30,869 --> 00:58:34,529
somebody else's property and there's no

1264
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,390
in there's complaints about that that

1265
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:38,970
can be an issue but if it's a private

1266
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:41,069
event and the chef is coming and they've

1267
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:42,599
procured cannabis elsewhere and you've

1268
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:44,670
procured the cannabis and you're

1269
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:47,759
curating the event in your own private

1270
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:50,159
space that is fine the BCC you cannot

1271
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,130
touch it right you're a private

1272
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:55,319
residence if you want to call a

1273
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:57,470
dispensary delivery service and have the

1274
00:58:55,320 --> 00:59:06,150
people individually that are there

1275
00:58:57,469 --> 00:59:10,250
that's different if it is private and it

1276
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:12,510
is not for cannabis there are potential

1277
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:14,280
workarounds that we can discuss about

1278
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:16,620
semantics we want to talk about legal

1279
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,880
loopholes mojo is making himself right

1280
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:21,719
at home I hope that does not bother

1281
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:24,030
everybody um so you're having a private

1282
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:29,609
event the second that you want to have

1283
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:32,970
vendors come and do interactions with

1284
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:35,130
consumers how did those vendors get to

1285
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:37,859
your private event like if we had

1286
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:41,039
vendors here this evening and they want

1287
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:44,099
to have their product available for you

1288
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:47,429
to interact with how do you get habited

1289
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:50,909
products get into the emmy Banks Danny

1290
00:59:47,429 --> 00:59:53,159
thank you so for my experience acquiring

1291
00:59:50,909 --> 00:59:57,449
the event license not a big deal it's a

1292
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:59,730
couple of pages to provide financial

1293
00:59:57,449 --> 01:00:12,809
reports and stuff like that I mean for

1294
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:15,630
me personally I was waiting for the yeah

1295
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:22,980
the temporary event but the biggest

1296
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:27,990
thing was the SOP standard operating

1297
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:30,449
procedures that really means it's all

1298
01:00:27,989 --> 01:00:34,429
those areas I guess that there's no

1299
01:00:30,449 --> 01:00:37,879
regulations and there is a

1300
01:00:34,429 --> 01:00:40,679
interpretation of regulation and

1301
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:44,670
basically I'm saying here's how it

1302
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:47,159
should work and all you brands the you

1303
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:48,420
know beside if you know that works for

1304
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:52,349
you or not because I'm taking

1305
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:55,409
responsibility on the process and this

1306
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:57,420
is the hard part I think like you talked

1307
01:00:55,409 --> 01:01:00,480
about vendors you can do private event

1308
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:02,250
or legal even know what not the vendors

1309
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,769
need to be happy so it's not just you

1310
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:08,579
getting the license is how do you

1311
01:01:04,769 --> 01:01:13,259
convince the brands mainly compliance

1312
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:14,480
manager that you are working within the

1313
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,250
regulations

1314
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,960
yeah and that comes down to your plan so

1315
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:22,199
before we get there just if your if your

1316
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,420
private event in your home don't sell

1317
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:27,809
anything the Avenger comes to do

1318
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:29,420
interaction how we you know advance a

1319
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:31,889
workaround for that is it goes through

1320
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:34,349
Quality Assurance it goes through a

1321
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:35,670
retailer somebody you pick it up you're

1322
01:01:34,349 --> 01:01:37,380
the event you purchase your daily

1323
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:39,210
allotment somebody else is working with

1324
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:41,340
your company they get it they set it up

1325
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:42,809
and somebody who's a representative can

1326
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:47,630
talk about the product but that

1327
01:01:42,809 --> 01:01:50,150
particular vendor cannot bring with them

1328
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:53,920
product that they have made

1329
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:56,329
at their lawful licensed facility

1330
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,430
without going through a distributor

1331
01:01:56,329 --> 01:02:00,710
who's responsible for the Quality

1332
01:01:58,429 --> 01:02:03,858
Assurance and the in the quality control

1333
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:06,289
track and going through a retailer and

1334
01:02:03,858 --> 01:02:08,358
having that product go through excise

1335
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:14,089
tab you know go through the whole system

1336
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:16,969
and if you're doing an event license

1337
01:02:14,088 --> 01:02:19,338
where you are licensed to do so to do so

1338
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:21,588
like in haul of flowers you have to work

1339
01:02:19,338 --> 01:02:24,380
with these brands to make sure that

1340
01:02:21,588 --> 01:02:26,869
there is a way for that clearance to

1341
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:28,430
happen and that process to go through so

1342
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:31,249
you work with either a streamline

1343
01:02:28,429 --> 01:02:33,139
distributor or now that we have SB 311

1344
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:35,078
and destroyed a distro transfer we'll

1345
01:02:33,139 --> 01:02:38,358
make that event I'm sure even easier

1346
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:40,400
next year and so everybody has to sign

1347
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:42,739
on everybody has to agree

1348
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:45,740
everybody has to provide to the event

1349
01:02:42,739 --> 01:02:49,608
organizer their license and their BCC

1350
01:02:45,739 --> 01:02:52,399
car or their agency's a number and then

1351
01:02:49,608 --> 01:02:55,578
as we enter this new year and it's a

1352
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:58,849
momentous a new week where the be are

1353
01:02:55,579 --> 01:03:01,730
not the BCC but DPH and DFA have both

1354
01:02:58,849 --> 01:03:06,369
issued their first annual permits which

1355
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:09,139
means in 30 days metric is upon us and

1356
01:03:06,369 --> 01:03:12,470
that is going to be even more difficult

1357
01:03:09,139 --> 01:03:15,048
for these sort of quasi legal pop-up

1358
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:17,509
events to occur as more and more

1359
01:03:15,048 --> 01:03:20,449
businesses become online for track and

1360
01:03:17,509 --> 01:03:23,809
trace it is going to be exceedingly

1361
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:26,568
difficult to show what happened to this

1362
01:03:23,809 --> 01:03:28,670
product if it did not merge throughout

1363
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:31,159
the entire supply chain the way it is

1364
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:33,470
intended so if you're having an event

1365
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:36,649
that is open to the public that has

1366
01:03:33,469 --> 01:03:39,528
consumption and sales you need to be an

1367
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:43,278
event organizer and set up in events

1368
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:45,170
license do the SOPs work with the local

1369
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:48,009
jurisdiction that's gonna be your

1370
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:50,900
threshold right so you need that local

1371
01:03:48,009 --> 01:03:53,028
authorization go through get the

1372
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:57,739
credibility get the event organiser

1373
01:03:53,028 --> 01:04:00,380
license draft up your SOPs go to the

1374
01:03:57,739 --> 01:04:02,150
city say this is the plan that I have if

1375
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:03,800
they have a process if they don't have a

1376
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:06,590
process if they have four process to

1377
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:08,390
ooh alcohol temporary alcohol permits if

1378
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:12,590
they have a temporary events rhetoric in

1379
01:04:08,389 --> 01:04:14,960
their existing ordinances then say this

1380
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:18,650
is just another widget this is just

1381
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:20,960
another event it simply is cannabis and

1382
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:22,970
we've already taken care of the devil

1383
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,159
and the details and here is the plan and

1384
01:04:22,969 --> 01:04:36,829
I tell you that will motivate and

1385
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:41,839
already motivated City one of your

1386
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:43,699
underage children it's just in the

1387
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:51,470
hypothetical world it may have been an

1388
01:04:43,699 --> 01:04:55,250
eighteen year old your yeah your I look

1389
01:04:51,469 --> 01:04:58,339
you're a parent your responsibility to

1390
01:04:55,250 --> 01:05:02,780
your children is yours now if you are at

1391
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:04,610
a bcc sanctioned temporary event you are

1392
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:07,850
not supposed to have minors present so

1393
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:11,720
no if it's your private event then

1394
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:13,400
that's gonna be an issue if somebody

1395
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:15,019
were to turn you in if you were going

1396
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,990
through her divorce that could be used

1397
01:05:15,019 --> 01:05:20,869
against you absolutely but barring that

1398
01:05:17,989 --> 01:05:26,839
that's not cannabis though look we're

1399
01:05:20,869 --> 01:05:29,679
talking family law we're talking the

1400
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:32,269
difference between family law and

1401
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:34,789
cannabis law cannabis law doesn't

1402
01:05:32,269 --> 01:05:37,219
concern itself with that because it says

1403
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:39,349
we don't regulate true private events

1404
01:05:37,219 --> 01:05:43,039
that doesn't mean the rest of California

1405
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:46,989
legal system doesn't see that there may

1406
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:51,289
be an issue there that I cannot opine on

1407
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:55,009
and to Peters question can I tell you

1408
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:58,309
all of the gray areas if cannabis is a

1409
01:05:55,010 --> 01:06:01,430
commodity information in my head is Plus

1410
01:05:58,309 --> 01:06:04,519
every circumstance is different and the

1411
01:06:01,429 --> 01:06:07,089
gray is nigh we want to find a legal

1412
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:11,139
loophole I don't consider that the gray

1413
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:15,960
what is the legality be

1414
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:19,569
kind growing wheat at your house and

1415
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:21,760
bringing it to an event can I bring my

1416
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:24,250
own personal weed I grew at home and how

1417
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,290
much of that and let's say that the

1418
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:28,659
ticket included some wheat that I grew

1419
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:31,029
at home is that a loophole is that real

1420
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:31,809
no well okay here's the difference oh

1421
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:35,800
you're talking about two different

1422
01:06:31,809 --> 01:06:37,509
things one is if you are an adult you're

1423
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:40,060
an adult 21 years are over you are

1424
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:43,660
entitled to grow six plants right the

1425
01:06:40,059 --> 01:06:46,889
regulators though the municipalities are

1426
01:06:43,659 --> 01:06:50,799
entitled to regulate what that means

1427
01:06:46,889 --> 01:06:52,420
responsibly without banning it within

1428
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:54,250
their jurisdictions it's a point that

1429
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,139
the city is often in or the local

1430
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:57,699
jurisdictions often grapple with because

1431
01:06:56,139 --> 01:06:59,409
what does that mean that means that it

1432
01:06:57,699 --> 01:07:01,210
needs to be shielded it means bill

1433
01:06:59,409 --> 01:07:02,679
building codes you know residential

1434
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:04,840
building codes that you're not harming

1435
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:06,819
your neighbor that is your right you can

1436
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:09,220
grow those six plants you can buy the

1437
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:11,559
clones at the dispensaries that is all

1438
01:07:09,219 --> 01:07:14,169
lawful you can take that product and you

1439
01:07:11,559 --> 01:07:16,659
can give it away to anybody that is

1440
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:19,090
around you that is 21 years of age or

1441
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:22,420
older which you cannot do that under a

1442
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:24,940
brand no because that would be

1443
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:26,320
conducting commercial cannabis activity

1444
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:29,019
and if you're conducting commercial

1445
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:31,150
can't are you gonna sell it what if it

1446
01:07:29,019 --> 01:07:32,889
was just promotional like these joints

1447
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:35,800
let's say these joints they're just

1448
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:38,440
promotional right so what's the

1449
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:40,890
difference between me rolling the joints

1450
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:44,380
with the weed I grew at my house and

1451
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:47,469
coming out and giving my friend a joint

1452
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:51,090
saying this is Dougie's joints what

1453
01:07:47,469 --> 01:07:54,429
start with you want to give people away

1454
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:57,910
you're he's talking Martha Stewart style

1455
01:07:54,429 --> 01:08:00,279
it's homegrown but really fancy stickers

1456
01:07:57,909 --> 01:08:01,329
it's fancy if you're not selling it and

1457
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:05,920
you're giving it away

1458
01:08:01,329 --> 01:08:09,759
there is a that's a marginally gray area

1459
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:12,220
but if you start branding no no no but

1460
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,020
you gotta wait cuz the bureau let's

1461
01:08:12,219 --> 01:08:16,449
let's also think about it this way you

1462
01:08:14,019 --> 01:08:19,390
can only grow so much cuz you're only

1463
01:08:16,449 --> 01:08:21,369
allowed your six plants and also the

1464
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:23,920
bureau just came out with language

1465
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:24,500
against technology platforms that are

1466
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,079
acting

1467
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:29,838
like a doc and trying to be a cat and

1468
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:31,579
saying if you are confusing the consumer

1469
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:36,649
because let us remember the Department

1470
01:08:31,579 --> 01:08:39,439
of Consumer Affairs is the parent to the

1471
01:08:36,649 --> 01:08:41,689
Bureau of cannabis control what is the

1472
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:44,869
main purpose and function of the

1473
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:47,750
Department of Consumer Affairs to ensure

1474
01:08:44,869 --> 01:08:50,838
that consumers in California are not

1475
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:54,560
confused or misled Oranje frauded so if

1476
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:56,778
you are in essence appearing because

1477
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,170
remember appearance or the likelihood of

1478
01:08:56,779 --> 01:09:02,000
children or any of those things is in

1479
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:04,548
fact enough to cause you to lose your

1480
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,409
license so if you are going to avail

1481
01:09:04,548 --> 01:09:10,220
yourself of looking like you are a

1482
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:12,769
commercial cannabis actor then yes

1483
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:14,539
that's walking the fine line in the

1484
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:16,310
wrong direction if you're giving away

1485
01:09:14,539 --> 01:09:18,109
enough joints where you got a house full

1486
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:21,259
of weed that's way more than six your

1487
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:24,829
six plants can produce then you're

1488
01:09:21,259 --> 01:09:27,439
violating law so whereas I say there's a

1489
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:29,630
gray area if you just want to be like a

1490
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:32,298
good sport growing your six plants and

1491
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:33,859
giving a product away I have friends

1492
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:36,259
that do that and that's perfectly

1493
01:09:33,859 --> 01:09:41,060
legitimately fine but the suckit you're

1494
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:42,890
trying to make a duck act like a cat the

1495
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:44,390
Bureau is staffing up enforcement they

1496
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:46,279
got some of the best social media I've

1497
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:48,859
ever seen I'd like to hire them for my

1498
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:50,450
business but they just post all the time

1499
01:09:48,859 --> 01:09:53,960
and who are they who are they hiring

1500
01:09:50,449 --> 01:09:57,979
just today a laundry list of enforcement

1501
01:09:53,960 --> 01:10:00,770
agents and they shut down an operator in

1502
01:09:57,979 --> 01:10:02,539
LA in the city of La that was a falsely

1503
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:03,980
conducting commercial cannabis activity

1504
01:10:02,539 --> 01:10:05,960
took 2 million dollars worth the product

1505
01:10:03,979 --> 01:10:07,339
and was going to find them they are not

1506
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:10,609
playing around anymore

1507
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:13,730
they are regulating the industry so

1508
01:10:10,609 --> 01:10:17,689
legal loopholes are different than

1509
01:10:13,729 --> 01:10:19,399
trying to squeeze a you know a P through

1510
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:20,899
you know a watermelon through the size

1511
01:10:19,399 --> 01:10:23,139
of something that's a P they're they're

1512
01:10:20,899 --> 01:10:23,139
different

1513
01:10:30,489 --> 01:10:37,630
why do you have on your finger the tool

1514
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:37,630
that associated you with illegal market

1515
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:46,539
so it's on my middle finger I have a

1516
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:49,670
tattoo which is the regulated cannabis

1517
01:10:46,539 --> 01:10:51,800
thing universal symbol packaging on my

1518
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:54,980
middle finger cuz this is my opinion of

1519
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,750
their job and you know their approach to

1520
01:10:54,979 --> 01:11:00,649
the whole thing I think it's garbage

1521
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:11,270
again and this is my mixed emotions with

1522
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:13,879
your bullshit VCC so I wanted you Nate

1523
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:14,570
legal I wanted to implied for public

1524
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,609
comment

1525
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:19,399
everybody in here seems like they're

1526
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:20,630
really interested in events we need to

1527
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:23,960
make some noise

1528
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:26,480
Laurie kind of stuttered and said we may

1529
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:29,930
or may not listen to you at NCI A's

1530
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:31,639
conference or she said we may they're

1531
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:33,890
gonna listen to us we're here they're

1532
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:36,500
gonna say any changes is what she said

1533
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:38,900
but I wanted to just throw this out

1534
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:42,050
there to put some ideas in your head for

1535
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:44,809
your public comments there's close to a

1536
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:48,829
hundred different license types for

1537
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:51,320
alcohol there should be a thousand times

1538
01:11:48,829 --> 01:11:54,460
more for cannabis because alcohol is

1539
01:11:51,319 --> 01:11:57,829
alcohol you drink it that's it you know

1540
01:11:54,460 --> 01:12:00,800
cannabis is way more complex and Laurie

1541
01:11:57,829 --> 01:12:04,250
Ajax came from the ABC she knows this

1542
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:07,190
stuff one of the things I really would

1543
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:10,010
love to see is an instructional tasting

1544
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:12,069
license they have that for alcohol why

1545
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:14,680
can't we have that for cannabis

1546
01:12:12,069 --> 01:12:18,590
instructional tasting you know

1547
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:20,780
consumption only you know we need to

1548
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:23,329
come up with some some really good

1549
01:12:20,779 --> 01:12:25,609
suggestions and make some comments and

1550
01:12:23,329 --> 01:12:28,130
even if they don't happen this time

1551
01:12:25,609 --> 01:12:30,199
around the Bureau is vested with the

1552
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:32,420
right to create new license types

1553
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:35,149
actually all of the agencies are and not

1554
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:37,949
just during rulemaking so this is not a

1555
01:12:35,149 --> 01:12:40,948
fight that if we don't win today we

1556
01:12:37,948 --> 01:12:42,988
when the war situation so I don't want

1557
01:12:40,948 --> 01:12:47,428
people to lose momentum if we don't see

1558
01:12:42,988 --> 01:12:49,619
substantial changes between now and when

1559
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:51,420
the official package goes to the office

1560
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:54,090
of administrative law on the 3rd of

1561
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:55,859
December these ideas of creating more

1562
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:58,409
license types that make the market more

1563
01:12:55,859 --> 01:13:00,179
palatable are definitely still there and

1564
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:02,429
then we are going to gear up for the

1565
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:05,250
legislative session of 2019 so I want to

1566
01:13:02,429 --> 01:13:08,369
take all the great momentum and make

1567
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:10,649
sure that it permeates through the

1568
01:13:08,369 --> 01:13:12,059
entire next year but with that Justin

1569
01:13:10,649 --> 01:13:23,399
you want to talk about the Emerald

1570
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:26,219
exchange clamor there is no official

1571
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:35,609
legal advice being exchanged I am simply

1572
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:48,899
giving my opinion it is it once you are

1573
01:13:35,609 --> 01:13:50,069
retained inside Jack okay on November

1574
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:52,889
10th we're going to be doing an emerald

1575
01:13:50,069 --> 01:13:54,750
exchange the city Santa Monica's signed

1576
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:56,340
off on it they're allowing us to do it

1577
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:58,529
they're allowing us to consume on-site

1578
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:00,329
the Chief of Police said that he sees no

1579
01:13:58,529 --> 01:14:02,099
difference between cannabis smoking and

1580
01:14:00,329 --> 01:14:04,920
cigarette smoking as long as it's not

1581
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:09,360
done within a twenty feet of a window

1582
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:11,279
event or a doorway we smoke weed so we

1583
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:13,529
are gonna bring our farmers market back

1584
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:14,698
to Santa Mon to Santa Monica for the

1585
01:14:13,529 --> 01:14:16,469
first time as the first time there's

1586
01:14:14,698 --> 01:14:19,198
gonna be someone like a cannabis market

1587
01:14:16,469 --> 01:14:21,689
in Santa Monica in the same space where

1588
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:22,678
they do the weekly food farmers market

1589
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:27,119
which is gonna be pretty sweet

1590
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:29,609
and our loophole essentially is we have

1591
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:31,619
partnered with herb delivery herb

1592
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:33,448
delivery is going to be on site you have

1593
01:14:31,619 --> 01:14:36,238
not partnered okay

1594
01:14:33,448 --> 01:14:38,519
they have cursed us to support a point

1595
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:42,009
in okay thank you there you go see this

1596
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:46,159
is exactly why I'm doing it can you edit

1597
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:49,070
okay so we they are not partner they are

1598
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:52,698
in a dispensary that is available to

1599
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:56,599
deliver to that location okay so what we

1600
01:14:52,698 --> 01:14:59,418
are essentially you are gonna be able to

1601
01:14:56,599 --> 01:15:01,969
see the product and then your you were

1602
01:14:59,418 --> 01:15:05,859
going to be able to place orders right

1603
01:15:01,969 --> 01:15:09,069
and herb is going to deliver it on-site

1604
01:15:05,859 --> 01:15:16,908
is that correct

1605
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:19,578
how is the product getting there you

1606
01:15:16,908 --> 01:15:21,109
know I get that so under the emergency

1607
01:15:19,578 --> 01:15:23,328
regulations and there is a very big

1608
01:15:21,109 --> 01:15:25,728
difference right the permanent

1609
01:15:23,328 --> 01:15:27,708
regulations go into effect sometime in

1610
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:29,780
January right now we are living under

1611
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:32,300
the readapted regulations and under the

1612
01:15:29,779 --> 01:15:34,128
re-adopted regulations you can have up

1613
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:35,989
to ten thousand dollars worth of product

1614
01:15:34,128 --> 01:15:38,359
in your delivery truck and as long as

1615
01:15:35,988 --> 01:15:40,688
you're receiving orders from those that

1616
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:44,328
are 21 years of age or older

1617
01:15:40,689 --> 01:15:46,579
you can be out for 30 minutes returning

1618
01:15:44,328 --> 01:15:51,469
fulfilling orders now point of fact this

1619
01:15:46,578 --> 01:15:53,748
will not not work into 2019 if the

1620
01:15:51,469 --> 01:15:56,300
regulations stay the way that they are

1621
01:15:53,748 --> 01:15:59,300
currently presented because dynamic

1622
01:15:56,300 --> 01:16:01,458
delivery is significantly lessened and

1623
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:04,779
there are more restrictions so during

1624
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:08,448
the emergency regulation period if

1625
01:16:04,779 --> 01:16:11,840
people that were attending allowable

1626
01:16:08,448 --> 01:16:14,958
consumption event happened to go on to a

1627
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,819
nap and happen to be able to place an

1628
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:20,328
order that delivery car from that

1629
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:22,998
licensed delivery service can keep

1630
01:16:20,328 --> 01:16:25,668
continually taking orders as long as

1631
01:16:22,998 --> 01:16:30,319
they are delivering to an address within

1632
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:32,719
the state of California that is a

1633
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:35,779
residence that is an approved residence

1634
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:39,168
now I want to go back to the point where

1635
01:16:35,779 --> 01:16:43,518
we were having some product that is

1636
01:16:39,168 --> 01:16:47,630
being displayed how are we getting said

1637
01:16:43,519 --> 01:16:56,719
product there

1638
01:16:47,630 --> 01:17:00,409
I mean what no no no no so the temporary

1639
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:01,279
the the type 9 delivery service has the

1640
01:17:00,408 --> 01:17:03,259
product that's gone through a

1641
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:06,679
distributor it's in their facility yes

1642
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:09,520
so there is no actual accept product

1643
01:17:06,679 --> 01:17:12,199
that is your personal that will be there

1644
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,780
that will be there right so there's no

1645
01:17:12,198 --> 01:17:18,219
like there can be education sure there

1646
01:17:14,779 --> 01:17:20,448
can be educational things there but not

1647
01:17:18,219 --> 01:17:22,670
cannabis there can be empty cannabis

1648
01:17:20,448 --> 01:17:24,948
branding things there can be up the

1649
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:28,760
cause you all that you want but you

1650
01:17:24,948 --> 01:17:33,019
cannot take branded product and give it

1651
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:34,400
to anyone else right but or you can't

1652
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,230
have it on display either that's what

1653
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:39,379
I'm saying it has to be the empty boxes

1654
01:17:36,229 --> 01:17:46,149
the outpost thing all of that you'll see

1655
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:48,859
the empty empty no cannabis products

1656
01:17:46,149 --> 01:17:50,359
right but you can have education and you

1657
01:17:48,859 --> 01:17:55,819
can talk about them and then the

1658
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:57,139
products that are lawfully you you can't

1659
01:17:55,819 --> 01:17:59,389
display it because he's not an event

1660
01:17:57,139 --> 01:18:02,119
licensee this is a private event at a

1661
01:17:59,389 --> 01:18:04,609
private residence that allows for

1662
01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:07,130
smoking and is a venue that is used for

1663
01:18:04,609 --> 01:18:09,139
that activity that has been approved by

1664
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:11,179
the local jurisdiction for only that

1665
01:18:09,139 --> 01:18:14,630
activity so they don't have a ban on

1666
01:18:11,179 --> 01:18:18,079
consumption as we do in the city of Los

1667
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:19,940
Angeles actually they are saying the

1668
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:22,519
city is saying this is used as a smoking

1669
01:18:19,939 --> 01:18:24,138
area for this is my understanding I have

1670
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:26,420
not spoken to the city I have not

1671
01:18:24,139 --> 01:18:29,929
reviewed the contracts hypothetically

1672
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:32,000
we're talking about so if that City has

1673
01:18:29,929 --> 01:18:35,510
approved that there will be consumption

1674
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:38,238
there that is not being the cannabis is

1675
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:41,510
not being provided by the people that

1676
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:43,250
are throwing the event and you're just

1677
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:45,949
there ik waiting cigarette smoke -

1678
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:47,510
cannabis smoke and you're filing all of

1679
01:18:45,948 --> 01:18:49,348
those rules because the second that you

1680
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:51,539
do not then they can

1681
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:53,340
and enforce you cannot have any

1682
01:18:51,539 --> 01:18:56,219
displayed cannabis like you did at your

1683
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:58,170
event unless it was you know pre

1684
01:18:56,219 --> 01:19:00,000
purchased at a dispensary and they're

1685
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:02,279
just it's a private event but in this

1686
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,368
case I wouldn't even suggest that given

1687
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:07,109
that the city has said that this is a

1688
01:19:05,368 --> 01:19:09,630
public you know place that you're used

1689
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:12,960
for consumption now because you can

1690
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:15,210
deliver anywhere under the temporary

1691
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,770
emergency readapted regulation and

1692
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:19,078
you've got that ten thousand dollar

1693
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:21,389
thing and you've got individuals

1694
01:19:19,078 --> 01:19:24,299
ordering their individual orders going

1695
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:26,789
to them that is purely only consumption

1696
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:29,880
you do not have a deal with them you do

1697
01:19:26,789 --> 01:19:33,149
not have an agreement with them they're

1698
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:36,569
just what people are talking about at

1699
01:19:33,149 --> 01:19:39,089
the event going on to that dispensaries

1700
01:19:36,569 --> 01:19:43,519
website that delivery services website

1701
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:46,590
placing orders again this will not work

1702
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,659
under the permanent regulations because

1703
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:51,659
you have significantly less product that

1704
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:53,670
can be in the car it was now taken from

1705
01:19:51,658 --> 01:19:57,118
ten thousand dollars in a payload to

1706
01:19:53,670 --> 01:20:03,750
five and only three thousand of that

1707
01:19:57,118 --> 01:20:05,880
cannot be pre-ordered product but then

1708
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:07,979
they clarified the BCC made an even

1709
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:11,130
further clarification that you can

1710
01:20:07,979 --> 01:20:14,149
deliver anywhere in California as long

1711
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:17,489
as you are following the delivery

1712
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:20,158
protocols in this regulation

1713
01:20:17,488 --> 01:20:21,868
it did not say follow the directions in

1714
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:24,269
this regulation which would mean that

1715
01:20:21,868 --> 01:20:26,339
you need local authorization so we may

1716
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:29,070
see some interesting pushback from the

1717
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:31,860
League of Cities because they further

1718
01:20:29,069 --> 01:20:34,979
clarified that you can deliver anywhere

1719
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:36,839
in to California so for Victorville open

1720
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:41,698
or Doug they no longer will be able to

1721
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:43,590
ban delivery under the proposed draft

1722
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:45,658
regulations as they are at somewhat

1723
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:48,469
ambiguous now although those would argue

1724
01:20:45,658 --> 01:20:50,939
that that's exactly what they did in

1725
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:54,179
advancing the readapted regulations so

1726
01:20:50,939 --> 01:20:57,269
are the draft permanent regulations okay

1727
01:20:54,179 --> 01:20:59,639
yeah sorry hypothetically without any

1728
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:02,130
other details and I have many many many

1729
01:20:59,639 --> 01:21:02,940
more questions with all of the

1730
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:05,250
disclaimers that

1731
01:21:02,939 --> 01:21:15,629
I have made your heading in a

1732
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:18,359
potentially viable direction there's a

1733
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:20,940
lot of caveats but you can see if you

1734
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:24,599
start the conversation with the city if

1735
01:21:20,939 --> 01:21:27,059
you use the laws and engineer them

1736
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:30,090
creatively to meet those stringent

1737
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:32,670
requirements there are pathways and from

1738
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:34,829
pathways come experiences that are

1739
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:37,319
positive which then may lead the city of

1740
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:39,659
Santa Monica to develop a specific

1741
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:41,670
events license that allows you to do

1742
01:21:39,659 --> 01:21:43,948
this event with sales why because you

1743
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:45,510
listen to them you did the event the way

1744
01:21:43,948 --> 01:21:47,729
that it was supposed to be done in the

1745
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:50,489
most compliant manner and we can talk

1746
01:21:47,729 --> 01:21:53,689
about that possible and then you're

1747
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:57,539
gonna develop a rapport with the city

1748
01:21:53,689 --> 01:21:59,899
can I sell tickets you can sell tickets

1749
01:21:57,539 --> 01:22:02,850
to the event that is just an educational

1750
01:21:59,899 --> 01:22:04,829
bringing together of people to have a

1751
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:07,949
cannabis and you can have food there

1752
01:22:04,829 --> 01:22:09,988
that is not cannabis infused you cannot

1753
01:22:07,948 --> 01:22:12,448
sell tickets to the right to be able to

1754
01:22:09,988 --> 01:22:16,619
call that delivery service in any way

1755
01:22:12,448 --> 01:22:20,429
shape or form no the city probably

1756
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:22,590
already said no but we switched the name

1757
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:25,079
to a mixer versus a market and we

1758
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:27,600
created an event bright page to sell

1759
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:31,469
tickets to an event where you can

1760
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:34,020
consume cannabis to a mixer to a

1761
01:22:31,469 --> 01:22:37,140
bringing together of people that can

1762
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:40,500
consume cannabis not that you will be

1763
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:46,680
providing in any way shape or form that

1764
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:48,448
we brought the lead at this event I did

1765
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:50,670
say that with an actual face I won't

1766
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:53,519
sell any weed at this event at the event

1767
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:55,199
with large asterisks of all of the legal

1768
01:22:53,520 --> 01:23:03,719
disclaimers and things that we need to

1769
01:22:55,198 --> 01:23:07,039
put into place I'm sorry okay but yes we

1770
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:07,039
will not sell weed at the event

1771
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:14,968
yeah no it's it's we've got to do a lot

1772
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:18,609
of things to prove that we get the with

1773
01:23:14,969 --> 01:23:22,689
responsibility you got it you got to do

1774
01:23:18,609 --> 01:23:25,420
it you got to be able to know what you

1775
01:23:22,689 --> 01:23:28,000
want and scale back to what you can do

1776
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:30,399
to eventually get to what you want and

1777
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:34,448
it's a hard thing to do

1778
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:36,460
it really is and I don't say it in an

1779
01:23:34,448 --> 01:23:38,198
easy way it's an exercise where you have

1780
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:40,389
to keep going back and forth and talk

1781
01:23:38,198 --> 01:23:43,000
about the same hypothetical and say okay

1782
01:23:40,389 --> 01:23:44,590
so we did this and that gets me to here

1783
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,329
and then I'm gonna go here and I want to

1784
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:48,699
make sure that this is very clear that I

1785
01:23:46,329 --> 01:23:50,948
am NOT confusing consumers about what

1786
01:23:48,698 --> 01:23:52,689
they are purchasing a ticket for because

1787
01:23:50,948 --> 01:23:55,960
the other thing that I'm going to leave

1788
01:23:52,689 --> 01:23:58,359
you with is your actions the BCC hey you

1789
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:01,060
do something illegal you can be banned

1790
01:23:58,359 --> 01:24:06,519
from ever getting into the cannabis

1791
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:08,590
industry okay an expungement works going

1792
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:12,820
backwards not when you do something you

1793
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:16,480
know was wrong today right and the fines

1794
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:16,960
for that with the BCC are about what are

1795
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:19,689
they

1796
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:22,239
it's the the fee plus half of what you

1797
01:24:19,689 --> 01:24:24,250
should have paid in the in the amount of

1798
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:25,718
money that you made so you're paying the

1799
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:27,550
money and then you're never allowed to

1800
01:24:25,719 --> 01:24:29,230
operate in this space again because when

1801
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:31,239
you go to every other jurisdiction in

1802
01:24:29,229 --> 01:24:33,309
this country and outside of this country

1803
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:35,829
they ask you if you've ever been

1804
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:37,659
convicted of a cannabis issue and if

1805
01:24:35,829 --> 01:24:40,269
it's a cannabis issue after there was

1806
01:24:37,658 --> 01:24:44,259
compliance in your state I promise you

1807
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:47,080
it will be 15 to 20 years before that is

1808
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:51,000
not held against you if that is even

1809
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:55,960
when they start having that conversation

1810
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:59,139
I'm a real Debbie Downer today but to

1811
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:01,060
lighten it up there are ways look this

1812
01:24:59,139 --> 01:25:02,829
is a creative dynamic discussion I'm

1813
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:04,810
sure there's discussions that Danny and

1814
01:25:02,829 --> 01:25:07,689
Green Street and those attorneys had is

1815
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:10,330
you keep going over it until you get to

1816
01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:13,448
a point where you are comfortable with

1817
01:25:10,329 --> 01:25:16,238
how that protocol works and how you're

1818
01:25:13,448 --> 01:25:17,738
presenting it to the public because

1819
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:20,109
that's really the difference between a

1820
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:21,069
public and private event a consumption

1821
01:25:20,109 --> 01:25:25,179
event and in

1822
01:25:21,069 --> 01:25:28,630
than where you have sales and so you got

1823
01:25:25,179 --> 01:25:31,000
to walk it through multiple times like

1824
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:33,609
at nauseam times and then you're gonna

1825
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,039
be you're gonna see wins and there are

1826
01:25:33,609 --> 01:25:38,078
wins and there are movement the needle

1827
01:25:36,039 --> 01:25:40,750
is moving it is slow and it is difficult

1828
01:25:38,078 --> 01:25:43,118
but it is moving and can I just say that

1829
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:46,029
everything that happens at your private

1830
01:25:43,118 --> 01:25:48,299
event is going to be on the Internet

1831
01:25:46,029 --> 01:25:53,078
especially the stuff that you don't yes

1832
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:56,529
to be on the Internet and the cities and

1833
01:25:53,078 --> 01:25:59,880
the BCC is watching the internet they

1834
01:25:56,529 --> 01:26:10,300
are I got spanked you know they are

1835
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:13,359
holding my leg so obviously I do but

1836
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:15,579
let's just say from someone who's not in

1837
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:18,729
the space like a caterer that's outside

1838
01:26:15,578 --> 01:26:21,158
that wants to perhaps you know cater an

1839
01:26:18,729 --> 01:26:23,198
event not in an infused fashion but just

1840
01:26:21,158 --> 01:26:26,408
producing food at these events do they

1841
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:30,698
run greater risks than they would and in

1842
01:26:26,408 --> 01:26:33,009
the national space like are they are

1843
01:26:30,698 --> 01:26:35,019
they held due to different taxation

1844
01:26:33,010 --> 01:26:37,960
brackets or anything like that or is

1845
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:40,679
there any any of the BCC like influence

1846
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:43,510
is going to be like felt on their end

1847
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:44,800
there's a normal cake catering business

1848
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:47,639
not like something like I was a co-op

1849
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:51,279
event I mean at a certain point right

1850
01:26:47,639 --> 01:26:54,630
honestly now you know we work

1851
01:26:51,279 --> 01:27:02,618
exclusively with canvass brands but

1852
01:26:54,630 --> 01:27:04,750
people that aren't in the space don't

1853
01:27:02,618 --> 01:27:07,210
and and are hesitant to take some of

1854
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:13,649
these jobs because of working with the

1855
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:16,420
cannabis money in the first place yeah

1856
01:27:13,649 --> 01:27:17,279
the taxation and how that affects your

1857
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:19,989
business

1858
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:22,779
unfortunately tax is not my area of

1859
01:27:19,988 --> 01:27:25,328
specialty it's very complicated as a

1860
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:26,948
general specialty even more so when it

1861
01:27:25,328 --> 01:27:29,349
comes to cannabis so I would refer you

1862
01:27:26,948 --> 01:27:31,909
to a good tax professional that would

1863
01:27:29,349 --> 01:27:33,560
help you with that one risk of there

1864
01:27:31,909 --> 01:27:38,380
licences with cannabis being up these

1865
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:40,310
events and you know maybe not all of the

1866
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:42,949
there's gonna be a difference between

1867
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:45,170
all the time let's say there's an

1868
01:27:42,949 --> 01:27:46,550
illegal cannabis activity going on and

1869
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:48,529
the person that's there catering

1870
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:50,989
worst-case scenario and something

1871
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:54,769
happens there what what kind of risks

1872
01:27:50,989 --> 01:27:57,219
are they running like added risks the

1873
01:27:54,770 --> 01:28:02,840
caterer is like like you know as

1874
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:05,060
somebody I'm not I'm not necessarily

1875
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:06,980
worried about myself I mean no III know

1876
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:08,930
you're asking a question I got into

1877
01:28:06,979 --> 01:28:12,229
cannabis when the affirmative defense

1878
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:14,390
and criminal law was not the that's not

1879
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:17,299
my area my area is land use sequel

1880
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:19,700
licensing and regulation but what I will

1881
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:21,440
tell you is you know be responsible ask

1882
01:28:19,699 --> 01:28:26,149
questions if you're going somewhere and

1883
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:28,729
it feels wrong it usually is if you are

1884
01:28:26,149 --> 01:28:30,559
conducting a private event you know

1885
01:28:28,729 --> 01:28:32,869
you're going and for the most part

1886
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:35,030
you're procuring your allotted allowance

1887
01:28:32,869 --> 01:28:37,069
of cannabis and then you're curating

1888
01:28:35,029 --> 01:28:41,539
this event in a private in a private

1889
01:28:37,069 --> 01:28:43,670
space for a dinner party issues with

1890
01:28:41,539 --> 01:28:53,210
that like in the private home things

1891
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:56,449
going poorly or yeah it all affects your

1892
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:58,630
insurance I don't necessarily know if

1893
01:28:56,449 --> 01:29:01,639
I've answered the questions to the

1894
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:04,100
satisfaction of what you're covered for

1895
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,300
well okay they played up asking if

1896
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:06,500
there's cannabis at these events now

1897
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:10,579
when you'd won you get insurance for

1898
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:12,649
these things but I mean that's and then

1899
01:29:10,579 --> 01:29:14,420
that answers your own creston right if

1900
01:29:12,649 --> 01:29:16,219
somebody saying they can't insure you in

1901
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:19,010
that situation then you're putting

1902
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:21,140
yourself you know in where there's

1903
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:22,880
liability there is cannabis yeah sure if

1904
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:25,610
you're the one that's producing this

1905
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:27,800
product and you know this is why testing

1906
01:29:25,609 --> 01:29:29,599
became a thing in California and why

1907
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:32,300
testing is so important everywhere if

1908
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:35,270
you're over can over serving somebody

1909
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:37,820
the same way if you were to over serve

1910
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:38,360
somebody in you know in a house liquor

1911
01:29:37,819 --> 01:29:41,118
and

1912
01:29:38,359 --> 01:29:43,279
they leave you know a bars responsible

1913
01:29:41,118 --> 01:29:45,109
for that and but I pulled plenty of

1914
01:29:43,279 --> 01:29:46,429
temporary license for ABC and like the

1915
01:29:45,109 --> 01:29:48,799
worst they do is just shut you down and

1916
01:29:46,429 --> 01:29:51,980
take the license and maybe there will be

1917
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:55,429
a small fine but it's it's I mean I feel

1918
01:29:51,979 --> 01:29:58,129
like alcohol is is light-years away from

1919
01:29:55,429 --> 01:30:01,279
where we are in cannabis and you've got

1920
01:29:58,130 --> 01:30:03,050
to be responsible with your business and

1921
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:04,908
and with who you choose to do business

1922
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:09,199
with and how you choose to do that

1923
01:30:04,908 --> 01:30:12,649
business I my area of specialty is

1924
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:14,928
working with licensees so you're really

1925
01:30:12,649 --> 01:30:18,109
asking some you know bright-line rules

1926
01:30:14,929 --> 01:30:24,440
between accounting and you know where

1927
01:30:18,109 --> 01:30:26,719
the line is with there's a way there's

1928
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:28,669
certainly ways to do it and there's but

1929
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,679
like we said private events consumption

1930
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:31,880
events where there is no sale these are

1931
01:30:30,679 --> 01:30:36,649
different somebody's throwing a dinner

1932
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:39,109
party you go same as if you're serving

1933
01:30:36,649 --> 01:30:42,979
alcohol I mean are you think hosts

1934
01:30:39,109 --> 01:30:45,019
should be I think hosts should be as

1935
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:49,238
responsible as they would be by opening

1936
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:51,080
the same amount of mind-altering

1937
01:30:49,238 --> 01:30:54,500
substance as they would if they were

1938
01:30:51,079 --> 01:30:56,329
serving wine if you're serving people 60

1939
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:58,130
milligrams of marijuana throughout a

1940
01:30:56,329 --> 01:30:59,350
meal and there's not enough time and you

1941
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:01,310
don't know what everybody's

1942
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:03,289
endocannabinoid system is would you give

1943
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:05,239
everybody a bottle of wine to drink I

1944
01:31:03,289 --> 01:31:07,100
think that's where that's where the host

1945
01:31:05,238 --> 01:31:09,948
needs to be responsible and that's also

1946
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:11,900
where responsible you know cannabis

1947
01:31:09,948 --> 01:31:13,819
chefs come in and they trade a meal and

1948
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:16,129
it's enhancing and it's like having

1949
01:31:13,819 --> 01:31:18,408
alcohol I would be you know remiss to

1950
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:22,118
say that I think there's not ever a

1951
01:31:18,408 --> 01:31:24,888
concern where you're mixing substances

1952
01:31:22,118 --> 01:31:26,599
potentially but you know have waivers

1953
01:31:24,889 --> 01:31:28,940
people have dinner parties they have

1954
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:31,190
waivers this is a new area it's

1955
01:31:28,939 --> 01:31:33,678
important to protect yourself and your

1956
01:31:31,189 --> 01:31:35,479
business as you move throughout this

1957
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:37,690
process and there's ways for you to do

1958
01:31:35,479 --> 01:31:37,689
that

1959
01:31:50,520 --> 01:32:00,710
