1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,940
I've been doing that since 1986 so talk

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:14,160
to me about strains from the past that

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:18,118
you can't find a skunk wad true skunk

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,050
one the golf-ball indica nobody has it

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:23,429
anymore

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:28,980
that's that one

7
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:34,200
the original mando purple golf ball in

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:38,460
because it's gone you saw there you saw

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:47,340
it coming out of Mendocino Ukiah that

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:50,100
area and it was just phenomenal and it's

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,219
gone you know it disappeared in the

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,149
early 90s both of those both of those

13
00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:00,120
days the camp raids were more effective

14
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:03,149
than people think they were I mean yeah

15
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:07,069
a lot of grills were left intact up

16
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:13,950
there but a lot of stranger lost a lot

17
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:16,649
by just attrition or by by bolt by both

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,960
crossbreeding the seeds you know

19
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,020
pollination that people didn't really

20
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:27,959
know where that pollen came from you

21
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:31,368
know we had some great sticky weed in

22
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,368
the late 80s early 90s

23
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:44,379
to talk about the SS f v OG so I still

24
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:48,219
have that string I've had it for 27

25
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:52,000
years week long what's the history of

26
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:55,079
which it actually came in through Point

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,640
Mugu Naval Air Station in a backpack

28
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,640
from those old Navy SEALs that we're

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,700
working in Afghanistan that's where it

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,618
came that's where it came and you got a

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:11,620
cut and I got a cut I got a bag of seeds

32
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:22,389
directly out of there and and what made

33
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:28,989
that a stand out purely affect it is the

34
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:34,449
original PK so sfv og its original name

35
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:41,019
with PK you know the pure coach and that

36
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:44,169
is the original ffs empty what's just a

37
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:47,379
pain in the ass to grow it was like an

38
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:51,219
ivy plant it went everywhere you know it

39
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:53,289
was just compared to like your Northern

40
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:56,319
California indica plants that were nice

41
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:59,048
and in uniform and bushy and you know

42
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,060
grew up like this this thing you

43
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:04,120
switched it into in the flower its

44
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:10,120
initial stretch could be as much as two

45
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:13,090
or three feet in 11 12 14 days like

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:18,189
maintaining a light height on those was

47
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:21,370
just like wow you know super hard you

48
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:23,739
know and and your bud structure was

49
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,959
nowhere as close together that's the end

50
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:28,390
of us out of Northern California you

51
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,659
know it would be like a bud and then a

52
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:34,629
blank spot for eight or nine inches

53
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:37,299
another bud and then it was like an ivy

54
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:40,209
plant just going everywhere so getting

55
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:43,209
that plant to respond properly and get a

56
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,200
tight bud structure what's this really

57
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:50,150
really

58
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:52,609
