2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:15,509
just quickly because I'm sure everyone's

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,070
hungry but can we ask you about what we

4
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,550
were talking about up there which is

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,429
your philosophy on whether it's making

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:30,750
hash or tinctures of mixing cultivars

7
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:33,899
versus single cultivar sure I don't know

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,539
how deep to go into it but a lot of it

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,960
for me is I've come to realize how much

10
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:43,049
I don't know about this plant and what

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,840
it can do and yes the there are

12
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:47,939
cultivars that pop up that you know

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,190
they're intriguing to the nose and when

14
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,259
you breathe in the smell of that plant

15
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:55,468
you feel it in different parts of your

16
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,780
body so there's all those kind of cues

17
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,359
that are involved for me in trying to

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,340
understand what the particular chemistry

19
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,868
of this plant might be able to do for a

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,900
person who's seeking help with cannabis

21
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:12,719
and at one point in the work I was

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,689
really focused I felt like yes I want

23
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:19,319
strange specific products because if we

24
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:21,929
find a strain that actually does sorry

25
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,938
cultivar not strange as dr. Russo says

26
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,509
strain is something that happens to your

27
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,809
back

28
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,030
wait it's not the name of a plant okay

29
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,859
so cultivar if you find a cultivar

30
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,989
that's actually working then you want to

31
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:36,959
be able to know that particular cultivar

32
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:39,089
is going to help this person but what I

33
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,609
came to realize at some point there's a

34
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,719
couple of problems with that one it's

35
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:48,328
hard to have a very specific version of

36
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,569
a specific plant year after year after

37
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:54,569
year that's a lot you're either talking

38
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:58,349
mother's and clones or tissue culture or

39
00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:00,929
a very skilled breeder who can create a

40
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:05,099
seed line that will be consistently that

41
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:08,399
same thing over and over part of why I

42
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:12,598
started mixing different oils together

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,330
is that it was a combination of things

44
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,299
one of them

45
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:20,590
one of the issues was one of the most

46
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:24,130
challenging folks that I was trying to

47
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:27,759
work with needed a whole lot every day

48
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:31,090
of one specific cultivar that just did

49
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:34,030
not do well on my farm ACDC

50
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,099
is a plant that was first selected here

51
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,680
on the coast of Northern California

52
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:41,079
where the humidity is forty to sixty

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,300
percent and the temperature never gets

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,850
above eighty degrees and under those

55
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,040
conditions ACDC is just a happiest

56
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:51,579
little girl she produces these big

57
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:53,289
beautiful buds right reminded me of one

58
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,200
of the old school Bubba pushes I used to

59
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:58,810
work with years ago but I never saw that

60
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:02,530
version of ac/dc until I was in an

61
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,909
indoor room and part of what I was in

62
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,099
that room for was that I'd found

63
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:08,259
somebody who was growing ac/dc endorsed

64
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:10,000
and I was like oh I got to see what this

65
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:12,729
is how this is working because in my

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,500
garden it grew like a fern it couldn't

67
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:16,989
even hold its own weight up it was just

68
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,569
crazy and meantime I had this person

69
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:22,750
severely challenged by epilepsy whose

70
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:27,340
parents were utterly convinced ac/dc was

71
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:31,840
the only thing that would help so that

72
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,939
particular case I that first year I was

73
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,909
able to provide them with ac/dc I knew

74
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:41,770
someone who was growing it indoors and

75
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:46,359
made a trade with him so that I could

76
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:48,670
give it to them and but that next year I

77
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,950
was growing it again and I the family

78
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:52,929
came up to visit the farm and I showed

79
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:54,729
them I said this is the this is what you

80
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,189
want me to grow and and look it over

81
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:59,379
here here's a plant that has exactly the

82
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,810
same cannabinoids it smells different so

83
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:03,250
there's different terpenes going on but

84
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,830
it's the exact same cannabinoids that

85
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,020
are going on in this one so why don't we

86
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:12,489
try this for your son and see what

87
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:14,350
happens and they were I think they had

88
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,329
come to trust me at that point so they

89
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:18,548
were willing to try it and what we what

90
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:22,449
that year I had five different things

91
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:26,829
similar to ac/dc high CBD really low THC

92
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:30,969
and so I gave them what's that

93
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:34,089
those five worse our tzunami a plant

94
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:37,480
called Electra which is with cross of

95
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:39,269
auto and Valentine Valentine mother

96
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:46,590
plant auto of the mail

97
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:57,430
OTT oh let's see Electra sour tsunami

98
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:59,079
Harley Sue remedy and I don't know I

99
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,090
don't remember the fifth one anyway I

100
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,699
had I had like five different things so

101
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:06,039
I gave the family a pound of each of

102
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:08,740
those different flowers and suggested to

103
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,900
them that they try a little bit making

104
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,939
oil from each of them and give a little

105
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:16,149
bit of it to their son in his feeding

106
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:18,490
tube and see if one of them might work

107
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:22,299
better than ac/dc and it turned out in

108
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:26,769
fact that they because they only had a

109
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:28,300
pound it wasn't enough from the to do

110
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:30,699
the extraction process that they

111
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,120
normally did so they on their own

112
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:36,579
initiative decided to mix three pounds

113
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,160
together and two pounds together so they

114
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:41,769
made two batches and one of those

115
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,980
batches was so spectacularly successful

116
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:47,439
at helping him they the frequency

117
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,890
intensity and duration of his seizures

118
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:53,019
fell off dramatically enough that mom

119
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,250
called me like wait I don't understand

120
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:58,269
what's going on but the seizures have

121
00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:02,470
stopped and I'm you know I'm just like

122
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:04,719
beside me so it was good news and the

123
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,820
question then became what was it one of

124
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,620
those three or was it all three of those

125
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:11,469
things together and I didn't know the

126
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,930
answer so meantime she tried the other

127
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:17,310
preparation that was from the other two

128
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:21,280
and one of those two was Elektra and

129
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:24,069
that preparation not only didn't really

130
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,619
help him particularly when she gave him

131
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:30,399
just Elektra it actually made his

132
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,590
seizures worse and so when we tried to

133
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,589
understand what was going on there we

134
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:37,299
think it was turpino lean because Turpin

135
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:39,339
leaned in that particular cultivar was

136
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,620
about five times what it was

137
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:45,789
in the other four that we were working

138
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:48,399
with because of all of that that's a

139
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:51,250
long-winded way of saying I really came

140
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,569
to realize I don't really know what is

141
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,918
going to be best for this end user and

142
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:59,620
because in trying to make create a

143
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:02,409
product you're not really you can't

144
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,199
really compound formulations for one

145
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,820
person in the regulated market you're

146
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:12,100
creating a product for hundreds or

147
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:13,959
thousands of people and so because I'm

148
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,330
so convinced that the chemistry that the

149
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,310
cannabis plant makes cannot do any harm

150
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:20,889
if it's free of contaminants and other

151
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,629
issues that come with mixing it with

152
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,579
other things if it's free of

153
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:27,879
contaminants the plant cannabis plant

154
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:29,769
itself cannot do any harm so if we can

155
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,668
take chemistry from several different

156
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:37,569
cultivars and put them together it's

157
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:40,810
quite likely that maybe we'll get 80 or

158
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:42,069
90 of the possible hundred and 50

159
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:46,060
cannabinoids that the cannabis plant

160
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:47,228
makes in that one product and what one

161
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,689
of the things that we're finding is that

162
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:52,418
the cannabinoids particularly some of

163
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:55,810
the rare ones have really profound

164
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:57,668
effects at very very very small doses so

165
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,339
I'm really pretty convinced that the

166
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:03,159
whole plant medicine concept really is

167
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:06,728
not specific to one cultivar it is

168
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,520
really about making salads is how I view

169
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:11,110
it you're putting together some of this

170
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,449
one and some of this one and some of

171
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,949
this one and yes you think about what is

172
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,990
the cannabinoid profile that you're

173
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:19,449
shooting for at the end in your product

174
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,668
and maybe what kind of terpenes are you

175
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:23,949
looking for but what's really true is

176
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:26,199
even the scientists can't tell us for

177
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:28,870
sure what actually is going on and

178
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,300
because I'm not really a scientist I'm

179
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,269
just I love this plant and I've become

180
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,940
so convinced it can't do harm I really

181
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:40,598
want to offer the widest array of

182
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,339
possible benefit to any end-user that's

183
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,970
going to consume a product that I would

184
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:48,700
make and that's why I gave up for the

185
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,930
most part in medical preparations on

186
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,910
strain-specific preparation

187
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:55,759
because I'm pretty sure we don't really

188
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:59,929
know what's gonna be best for the folks

189
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:02,480
and so in trying for the widest efficacy

190
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:05,929
for the most number of people I think we

191
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,899
want the widest array of chemistry

192
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:11,120
available to those Center users that's

193
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,389
how I got to it so let me ask you

194
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,490
because we were talking earlier about

195
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:18,409
how cannabis is so hard for dosage

196
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,029
because everybody is so unique and

197
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:23,059
individual yes yes

198
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:26,480
so is your thought process on this on

199
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:28,039
the you know making it not cultivar

200
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,379
specific and bringing in as many

201
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,839
cultivars as you can is your thought

202
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:35,330
process then because everybody is so

203
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,970
specific you are going to be hitting the

204
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,680
majority there'll be something in there

205
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,610
that's the hope exactly that he will

206
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:45,439
actually be effective for more people

207
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,360
because there is more diversity in it I

208
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,970
love that you chose the word diversity

209
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,500
for this because that's exactly kind of

210
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,990
where I'm coming from in much the same

211
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,429
way that you were taking those

212
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,190
inoculations or those samples of the

213
00:09:55,429 --> 00:10:00,109
biology at different places on your land

214
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,360
at different times of year you're going

215
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,149
to get a real diverse selection of the

216
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,779
things that are there in much the same

217
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:12,559
way that we build our soil in our

218
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:17,329
gardens I think that through selecting

219
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:20,089
appropriate foods fermented foods the

220
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:23,930
idea including cannabis in those foods

221
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:27,110
we are in effect building the soil of

222
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:29,089
our bodies that and one of the like you

223
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,190
could think of the plasma that the

224
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,460
intracellular plasma and that the liquid

225
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:37,460
that makes up our bodies as the soil in

226
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:40,160
which we grow that that's where our

227
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:44,960
health springs from and if that is full

228
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:46,009
of diversity and beauty and everything

229
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,220
from you know

230
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:52,399
sauerkraut's in your gut to phyto

231
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,440
cannabinoids from the plants to the

232
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,509
herbs that you use in your cooking i'm

233
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,160
it's just and it and all of its coming

234
00:10:56,509 --> 00:11:02,529
from where you live you are

235
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,549
incorporating the biome that you live in

236
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,379
into your body

237
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:08,240
and so the diversity that we as

238
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:10,789
dragonfly Earth Medicine farmers are

239
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,190
trying to create and our farms is also

240
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:15,079
reflected in our bodies and I feel like

241
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:19,130
this is a really important component of

242
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,528
live real food and and to me it's I

243
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:23,600
think it's really important that it be

244
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:25,039
said that cannabis is not a silver

245
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,019
bullet it is not the answer to

246
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,360
everything we really need to be

247
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:32,299
integrative in our approach to wellness

248
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,250
and it includes our food and it includes

249
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:36,799
our attitude and in our intention and

250
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:39,708
the place that you come from in your

251
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:42,469
garden and in your work all of that fits

252
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:46,399
together to make something that crew is

253
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:49,009
holistic is is sustainable in the sense

254
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:57,309
of we can continue to do it while

255
00:11:49,009 --> 00:12:03,129
flourishing diversity yes yes

256
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:03,129
let's see thank you I really Wendy
