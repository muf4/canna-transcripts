[Music]

2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:14,548
tell us about the alliance

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:18,329
okay well Trinity County has its first

4
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:21,660
official trade association non-profit

5
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:24,329
member-driven agriculture Alliance and

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,778
basically we've been a really tight-knit

7
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:32,519
community always and we've been doing

8
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:35,070
all of our work as licensed participants

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,579
in the cannabis world especially as

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,320
farmers all just grassroots from the

11
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,370
beginning you know it has Trinity County

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,520
better enjoy to deal with no no I mean

13
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:50,959
not a right the regulations the policy

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,180
the politics the backlash from

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,039
conservative side of the county which

16
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:59,340
borders the Central Valley and has a

17
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,129
very different cultural mindset than

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,409
humble yeah we're in the southern we're

19
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:06,599
in West where were eight miles from the

20
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,350
whole county line in Grandpa Valley it's

21
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,539
over big mountains but they're already

22
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:15,478
know they're over there over a mountain

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,540
from us there's been a lot of crops when

24
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,039
Western Trinity has been really that's

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,560
the thing I was going to say is it's

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,560
been really painful in a lot of ways to

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,950
have to go out and deal with politics

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,840
but also it's democracy in action and

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,250
we're taking it into our own hands and

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,859
we had to because we were we were

31
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,489
looking at a van we were looking in 2016

32
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:41,789
at Trinity County part of the Emerald

33
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:45,390
triangle having a hard ban on commercial

34
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,360
licensed cannabis and we had to all buck

35
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,009
up and get out there and go start

36
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,500
participating in our local government

37
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,700
and it was high time that our generation

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
did that because we've been so

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,789
disconnected because we don't trust it

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,409
we don't believe in it and I mean it

41
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:00,210
will say it's proven to me that it is

42
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,118
exactly what I thought it was going to

43
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:05,280
be but at the same time our community

44
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,500
was really brought together and forced

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,769
to forced to like bring these issues out

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,479
into the open because in for so long in

47
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:14,370
Trinity it was just like nobody talked

48
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,639
about it in public everybody knew what

49
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,080
they had going on in their backyard but

50
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:24,298
everybody had a cover story it wasn't

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:26,219
like it was a very still secret behind

52
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:29,610
the green curtain in society even within

53
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:31,739
our own communities which are really

54
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,900
remote and really tighten it and people

55
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,640
really look out for each other it's a

56
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,200
really sparsely populated County it's

57
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:42,000
fourteen thousand people and if you were

58
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,949
to iron out flatten out all the

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,319
mountains and if you flattened out the

60
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:49,289
acreage because it's very steep you'd be

61
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,629
the size of Texas so there's 14,000

62
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:53,429
people nestled in these little valleys

63
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,430
and lots of crannies with these huge

64
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,989
mountains between us and you know we

65
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,540
know the people in our communities

66
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,370
really well we all rely on each other

67
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,069
because we're it's how it is out there

68
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,289
but but then we as a county had to all

69
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,909
really come together and as you know

70
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:11,639
people coming from kind of different

71
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:14,068
walks of life have to acknowledge that

72
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,708
cannabis is really important

73
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:19,439
agricultural products to our economy to

74
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:22,939
our local economy and that we do need to

75
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,889
diversify from it but we also need to

76
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:28,439
accept it and figure out how to take

77
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:30,389
care of our environment and bring in

78
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:34,799
this industry in a way where we can

79
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:38,010
actually have a say in how how we care

80
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,439
for our watershed and you know it was it

81
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:43,469
was important to us in our future that I

82
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,449
I wish we could I wish we could fish in

83
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:48,030
the Southfork you know I wish there were

84
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:50,539
more than 11 chinook salmon left in the

85
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,729
river behind my house for my children my

86
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:56,519
children's children so there were a lot

87
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:59,219
of reasons to do it to come out of the

88
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,830
woods and have to deal with regulation

89
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:04,259
and the freaking government but also to

90
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,049
demand our rights as human we're

91
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:08,579
supposed to be the ones telling them

92
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,590
what to do that's the way it's supposed

93
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,819
to work so let's hold them up to it and

94
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:17,430
it's just an endless job but we finally

95
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,829
after four years of working as just a

96
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,180
tight-knit grassroots community came

97
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,310
together and officially formed an

98
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,949
organization the Trinity County

99
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,370
Agricultural ioan sand it's totally

100
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:32,610
member-driven not-for-profit and we were

101
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:36,870
founded this year and so now we have

102
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:39,569
this official United voice and there are

103
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,449
a lot of us and we have legal license

104
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:45,288
successful businesses now and and we're

105
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:50,399
paying taxes what we're doing a lot so

106
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:56,519
we're at the table and it's mostly to

107
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:59,429
focus where it started we were building

108
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,468
the Trinity brand yeah the idea is

109
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,900
really is that we all have to work

110
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,879
together to be we all are Trinity

111
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:10,379
together there's not that many of us

112
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:13,339
even all together we're one day we all

113
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,339
are together

114
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:21,019
you need to like resources exactly I

115
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,379
mean a lot of it a lot of different

116
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:27,049
things that we can work person out who

117
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:29,780
knows about metric that we can all talk

118
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,538
to and we all pay them for there's a lot

119
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:33,939
of it is education and enablement not I

120
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:38,029
mean they're ourselves in each other

121
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:41,168
just for like navigating and being like

122
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:47,809
okay what do we need to do we're all

123
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:51,649
figuring this out no so that the metric

124
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:54,589
person comes and we you know like it's

125
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:57,288
like because with Trinity worse well

126
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:59,810
we're we're so remote you know what I

127
00:05:57,288 --> 00:06:01,879
mean we need a place where cuz we can

128
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,879
all get together but it's hard to get

129
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:06,978
other people to come see us at each of

130
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,050
our spots because we're all so far away

131
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:12,139
from each other like out you know in the

132
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,598
mountains so it's really great when we

133
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,060
can come together and we can say what we

134
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:20,839
all need this and we can have one person

135
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:23,300
or like not necessarily one person but

136
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:25,579
like somebody the person we need to give

137
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,348
us the information about the regulations

138
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:31,399
that we're all dealing with collectively

139
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:34,158
or the problems we're having with really

140
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:38,239
remote we have a high demand for our

141
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:40,490
product but it's inefficient with the

142
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,028
regulations with the transport

143
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,038
regulations with everything to really to

144
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:48,968
reach all these reach everybody as

145
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:51,589
individual farms so one of the big

146
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:55,579
concepts of working together is a trade

147
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:57,769
organization is to help get our product

148
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:59,478
to market and to find partners we can

149
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:01,519
work with collectively and who can reach

150
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:04,610
to out to us collectively and have a way

151
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:07,728
to kind of vet people also that are good

152
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,210
to work with because there is a high

153
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:12,180
demand for Trinity product and

154
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:14,189
it's hard to know who you have to know

155
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,459
somebody so this is a way for us to be

156
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:19,529
able to also outwardly reach out and

157
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:20,819
also I mean we joke a lot in Trinity

158
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:22,888
that we're like you know Humboldt

159
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:25,019
best-kept secret or whatever this or

160
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:28,620
that because there's so few of us and

161
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:30,269
most people it's most people unless

162
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,660
you're a real like connoisseur and

163
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:35,698
really into the whole story of lead you

164
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,169
you've maybe never heard of Trinity

165
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,879
County and even if you're into Eve

166
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:49,319
you've heard of Humboldt probably but

167
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:51,180
you tell me you might not have a people

168
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,610
don't like to go up drive that far

169
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,310
depending on where they are but that's

170
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,960
the way it is all over the state you

171
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:04,288
know what I mean like if you're just

172
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:06,359
somebody like I do the Bay Area I do you

173
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:08,430
know it's so the way they've structured

174
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,259
it doesn't really work you know what I

175
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,560
mean because it'd be easy if I could

176
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:15,030
just do my own sales I could be like

177
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,908
yeah I can bring it to you I can bring

178
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:25,709
in whatever but with the with the rigs

179
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:26,879
how they are it's like well we're you

180
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:30,269
know you've got to find the distributor

181
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:34,099
that service your clients there it's

182
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:34,098
just you know there's a lot

183
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,070
no they're still arguing about

184
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:44,560
storefront retail or they are they set

185
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,410
up an ad hoc nothing's happening we have

186
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:58,719
none we have non storefront retail we

187
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:59,860
have delivery and we finally got it it's

188
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,629
all like pulling teeth

189
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,879
Trinity because we do have a really

190
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:09,389
conservative affluent demographic part

191
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:12,700
of our population and so it's hard to

192
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:15,639
push the ordinances through and in

193
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,740
storefront retail like everybody was

194
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,990
like oh we'll never have a dispensary in

195
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,940
downtown or either go but now I think

196
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:25,089
actually the momentum has shifted a lot

197
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,210
and they are working on storefront

198
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:30,400
retail but it doesn't exist at this

199
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,509
point in time it's not actually there

200
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,669
right now I can't go work with them and

201
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:38,679
so even if there were there's definitely

202
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:41,139
always there's any way more cultivation

203
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,299
than then there is going to be retail

204
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:46,679
for you know the amount of tourism and

205
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:50,039
population that we compared to how much

206
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:52,689
definitely for export I mean I think

207
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,809
initially I think essentially it's you

208
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:58,000
know like we're all waiting for federal

209
00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:01,479
laws to change and things to move on

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,250
with all the rest of that and then we'll

211
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,310
see what happens because ultimately I

212
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:10,450
mean I think Trinity's Trinity has our

213
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:12,729
our you know pool of buyers this shrunk

214
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,480
way down to like California and even

215
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,159
then being like inefficient throughout

216
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,370
more than beyond Northern California is

217
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,500
just inefficient so it's easier as a

218
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,929
farm to just work with brands and

219
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,070
distributors who will deal with all of

220
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:32,569
the rest of that you know

221
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:34,700
you have to make choices about a lot of

222
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,710
things like at the end of the day is it

223
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,590
worth it to worry about every store

224
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,210
you're in or is it easier to just let

225
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,129
someone else worry about how many jars

226
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,320
are coming off the shelf and spend more

227
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:48,169
time with your family you know like

228
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,879
whoever pays me the money like like that

229
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:51,620
it's pretty simple you know and that's

230
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:53,570
been insane with the regulations it's

231
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,820
just figuring out how to conduct all my

232
00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:00,500
business to that point I mean you guys

233
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:02,450
have such a unique story that you do

234
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,860
sell most your product already in jars

235
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:09,590
or is there something but that's white

236
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:12,680
label well it's it's usually copra but

237
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:14,600
there's no one way that it's worked and

238
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,239
it's very difficult as a independent

239
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,550
farm unless you're vertically integrated

240
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,590
with all the licenses all the way up to

241
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:23,120
really get your costs as fact that you

242
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:27,200
put into being your own brand because

243
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,810
it's very expensive to be a brand I see

244
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,940
that financially speaking I make more

245
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:33,679
money white label in my progress it's a

246
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,620
lot easier to just concentrate on the

247
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:39,259
farming and I mean we're fortunate that

248
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,450
people do co-brand with us and give us

249
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:44,149
credit but I'm looking for somebody

250
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:47,540
who's fair and just an ethical business

251
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:49,789
partner and like I I appreciate I think

252
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:52,549
I think it's important that people get

253
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:54,500
credit for the work but I also have to

254
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:56,949
live in reality and it's a lot easier I

255
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,289
mean we never have trouble with finding

256
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:03,110
like the idea behind growing good

257
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:05,059
quality is that it's good to have a

258
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,230
demand either way and that we've always

259
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,719
been able to tell that we were

260
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,210
completely anonymous people before when

261
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,519
we

262
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,920
to pretend we were just musicians and

263
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,740
whatever I'll seen him like we all had

264
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,979
our cover stories and it wasn't part of

265
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:24,750
our story it wasn't about that

266
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:26,490
and we've kind of decided to become let

267
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,830
it be part of our story and just beat

268
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,440
speak the truth and be ourselves because

269
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:34,740
part of the whole point of this is that

270
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,750
we shouldn't have to hide it but as far

271
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,879
as like branding our farm it's like yeah

272
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,679
I'd love to just be an independent farm

273
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,090
label like an independent wine label I'd

274
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,370
love to be able to just sell it at the

275
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:50,160
farmers market and people could come way

276
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:52,200
out there mount they want to put so much

277
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,079
weed that way we could just be a normal

278
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,540
brand label like small brand label the

279
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,129
thing is that I I see the reason you

280
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,860
guys cultivate the way you do is because

281
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:02,879
it's right but it is a branding

282
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,649
technique I guarantee you the

283
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,059
distributor's see that your style of

284
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,679
growing is a branding technique but that

285
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:09,569
being said it resonates with the

286
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,059
consumers mochas as a branding I think

287
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,590
because it feels right so I think that's

288
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,479
the cool part of getting your story out

289
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,740
in the jarring perhaps as an easy way to

290
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,340
do that because there's that recognition

291
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,810
but the the key is that like that it's

292
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,820
the distributor the retail that are

293
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:26,069
seeing the financial in that it's the

294
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,540
retailer that's seeing the same thing

295
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,640
you're seeing in why you're growing that

296
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:35,429
way is why they're consuming that and so

297
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:38,399
that's still a pendulum its it still it

298
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:41,729
benefits us a lot but it also we're

299
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,309
still battling the whole oh this is full

300
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,940
season outdoor oh the price is this like

301
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:50,489
commodification of the product and total

302
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,810
disregard for the quality but they will

303
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,659
take it and they will put it in a jar

304
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:56,969
and pretend it's indoor and baby put it

305
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:01,139
on the top shelf and just know and and

306
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:03,450
perpetuate that man so you know like we

307
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,580
appreciate having partners who

308
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,200
you recognize recognize like you're

309
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,470
saying and passed that on to the

310
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:15,210
consumer and I'm creating access to that

311
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:17,910
I think it is why it's so important to

312
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:20,310
be honest of on all fronts not that we

313
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:24,449
weren't B but being frank that we know

314
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:28,589
in the past brokers and whatever word

315
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:30,360
playing those games and maybe I saw less

316
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,190
of an issue with in the past than I do

317
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,110
now I was kind of whatever that's their

318
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,480
trip but now I'm like really seeing

319
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,460
though it's like it's it's it's messing

320
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,070
with the consumer to such a you know

321
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,680
level when you are start making that

322
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:46,410
false association which sometimes is

323
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:49,620
true but we've know so much it's not and

324
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:51,389
it's a disservice to us maybe in a

325
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:56,970
financial realm but it's a disservice to

326
00:14:51,389 --> 00:15:00,500
the consumer also like and we need to

327
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:04,740
get over the like you can grow beautiful

328
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:09,269
beautiful weed in the Sun right you know

329
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:12,930
like naturally and like it's just why is

330
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:14,610
that so crazy the way nothing else well

331
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:18,449
I had this at recently I was talking

332
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:21,360
with a greenhouse producer and I was

333
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:24,930
explaining to him the verbage of indoor

334
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,360
and that in his world like greenhouses

335
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:29,519
are indoor because there is no indoor in

336
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,180
agriculture so the fact that we don't

337
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,740
even like you know greenhouse be that it

338
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:36,419
has to be this thing the Sun and the air

339
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,759
aren't allowed to touch it in order to

340
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,860
be the highest yeah and it was almost

341
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,490
like my mind to this this guy who it's

342
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,100
his whole world too but not cannabis

343
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:49,110
that that would even be a thing yeah

344
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,490
that greenhouses wouldn't be good enough

345
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,529
as a structure that we'd have to have

346
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:56,070
this this other thing that started off

347
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:57,689
as a way to hide the product and yeah

348
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,000
people developed a lot of skill and got

349
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,100
that a lot better and better obviously

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,330
to where they are with indoor that's

351
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,740
where it started from and I think I've

352
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,330
you know maybe even talking to you guys

353
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,289
about that in the past and that that's

354
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,570
translate

355
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:13,019
from being a necessity thing to be in

356
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:16,050
this sales point I think a big part of

357
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:19,289
it comes from this whole like our modern

358
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:23,490
technological view of ourselves as

359
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:28,139
humans controlling and being superior to

360
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:30,568
other like biology the natural things in

361
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:33,120
general that sterilization of things

362
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:36,179
being better than like having probiotic

363
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,769
like biodiversity things like that you

364
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:40,679
know that we have and and just

365
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:42,810
technology like people want to become

366
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,559
machines so that they can live forever

367
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:49,919
and this kind of stuff like I think that

368
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:53,309
mindset people like to play God with

369
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,370
their grow and if you can control all

370
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:59,129
factors like you're not in collaboration

371
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:01,350
with nature you're not you're you're not

372
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:04,078
like at the mercy of the elements

373
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,750
anymore you're in control of everything

374
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,779
about you created this little world in

375
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,308
this room and it's not the earth it's

376
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:15,029
like you know what I'm saying and I

377
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:18,058
think people get really into being like

378
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:20,599
mad scientist in their laboratory and it

379
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:25,068
comes from it just a very different

380
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:28,039
philosophy and it cos it seems

381
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:30,599
unconscionable to be like in a

382
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:36,700
closed-off

383
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:38,230
to garden recently do our job because we

384
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,049
want to be outside you can be in awe of

385
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,309
nature yeah so but I mean maybe they're

386
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,289
not all trying to play God I'm being

387
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:46,179
real no but no totally because it is

388
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:49,809
like that because it's like we're gonna

389
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:52,590
make sure that there's it's sterile you

390
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:55,809
know what I mean yeah and then like just

391
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:59,230
then people are like ooh bugs you know

392
00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:01,359
what I mean that's like like our we have

393
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,860
it our egg Commissioner did our

394
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:07,289
inspection and it was awesome because

395
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:09,399
he's very Pro pesticide he's like very

396
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:11,529
old-fashioned but he came out and he was

397
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,000
like oh look at that carpenter bee and

398
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:15,460
look at that bug and look at this and

399
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,140
that I'm like because he's a bug guy and

400
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:23,079
he loves bugs and yeah I plant these I

401
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,570
plant these plants and these bugs come

402
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:27,429
and they eat my other bugs that you

403
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:29,409
would spray pesticides on and

404
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:33,150
everybody's happy you know what I mean

405
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:45,880
like and there's no chemicals involved

406
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:54,400
and he was so like this his whole career

407
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:57,130
and all things and changing our

408
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,000
agriculture is the biggest way we're

409
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:03,120
gonna change

410
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,888
you know stop climate change or if we

411
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:09,178
can you know and I mean like we people

412
00:19:04,888 --> 00:19:12,000
need to get in the dirt and and doing

413
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:13,860
these things you know like whatever

414
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,960
you're gonna do like just get in the

415
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:17,668
dirt and do a little bit like that makes

416
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,769
a difference in plants and flowers and

417
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:22,049
more pollinators because like the way

418
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:23,849
they work as they go from flower to

419
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:27,000
flower to flower to flower so if

420
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:30,058
everybody just has a few you know it

421
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,788
makes a big difference and like my bees

422
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,769
go to my neighbor's flower gardens and

423
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:36,359
the flower gardens after them and like

424
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:38,819
them that farm down the road and it's

425
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,918
it's cause them for miss us bees

426
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:43,648
yeah it's great they go like two miles

427
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:52,889
or something so or you or maybe even

428
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:59,128
more I don't quote they go far I don't

429
00:19:52,888 --> 00:20:01,319
have a beat would be cool technology is

430
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:06,000
cool too you know but just the idea that

431
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:08,128
like we can there's there's just a very

432
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,919
different way of thinking that went off

433
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:12,869
it started as like we have to put the

434
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,470
plants inside to hide them but it turned

435
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:20,219
into this like whole thing of like I can

436
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:22,860
create a universe in this room and the

437
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,288
thing that people forget is that you can

438
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:27,028
still be a mad scientist in the soil and

439
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:29,940
on the farm that's what that is like

440
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:31,710
it's way more fun to have other things

441
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,870
it's like a video game you want a video

442
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:38,639
game we're like no things jump at you

443
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:40,528
ever nothing surprises you like how how

444
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:43,048
boring is that it's the same every year

445
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:45,089
like when it's outside and every and

446
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:48,000
were you really doing this season full

447
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:50,638
season cycle every year is different in

448
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,159
so many ways it affects the flavor you

449
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:55,179
know it's creamier this year it's it's

450
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:58,420
more tart this year

451
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:02,220
to me that's marketable that's that's

452
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,220
that that's

453
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:09,420
are gonna be great exactly that's we're

454
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:11,909
just waiting for the awareness to the

455
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,058
consumer and for everybody to catch up

456
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:17,040
because wine has been wine didn't start

457
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:21,420
out that way either when you look back

458
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:23,879
at how Prohibition and did with that and

459
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:26,160
how it how the wine industry evolved and

460
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,350
small winemakers couldn't sell direct

461
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,150
retail the way they can now they had to

462
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:32,279
push for that it took them a long time

463
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,370
to be strong enough force to get there

464
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:37,470
and we're just you know we're seeing a

465
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:40,739
lot of similar things where we're just

466
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:44,339
waiting for it all to catch up because

467
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:46,650
it is marketable it is special it is

468
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:50,279
good for the world yeah I think getting

469
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:53,910
that exposure of of your type of flowers

470
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,170
into the hands of more people that may

471
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,420
be in their own rights I've seen there's

472
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:59,220
some some hydro growers where like I

473
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,050
disagree like I don't like a lot of to

474
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,549
keep the key lights in their products

475
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:04,678
and I don't like a lot of the

476
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:07,519
methodology but what they're seen in

477
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:11,009
some of these systems is more complete

478
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:15,000
nutrition than in a failed attempt at

479
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:18,058
organics or whatever and because that

480
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,950
biology wasn't present the a lot of the

481
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:22,109
nutrition was not available to the plant

482
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,058
they got a subpar product and rather

483
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:27,240
than maybe correlating that saying how

484
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:29,730
could I make these systems in play they

485
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,329
went with this bottle Dormouse you know

486
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:35,700
raw salt nutrition program that has all

487
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:37,589
these detrimental effects that we see

488
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,240
but at least in their controlled

489
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:42,720
environment where they're able to

490
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,000
mitigate some of the problems they're

491
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,829
getting a certain complete nutrition

492
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,240
that they weren't getting what they're

493
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:53,879
incomplete non living soil organics and

494
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,549
to turn around full circle like see like

495
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,679
some of the herb that you guys produce

496
00:22:55,549 --> 00:23:01,349
that's getting that full nutrition it's

497
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:05,309
I think for me it's easier to say like

498
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:06,539
yes full Sun regenerative organics work

499
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:08,279
because it's true

500
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:14,409
it truly is nothing versus someone

501
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:17,329
that's like six months yeah Green

502
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,310
that's kind of why I see it all like in

503
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:22,009
your garden of nice and green source

504
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:22,669
gardens and Moon user farms and all the

505
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,589
ridge

506
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,720
you know radical herbs and like there's

507
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:27,980
so much beautiful I mean then there's

508
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,900
people I'm not even saying because

509
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,660
there's so many people you know we're

510
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:35,660
getting to know so many amazing people

511
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:49,580
who put their own take on this and it

512
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:57,380
adds an individual thing yeah we know

513
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:59,179
that but as long as we get cut in we're

514
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,640
happy about it you know what I mean I

515
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,350
think it's fair as long as but if you

516
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,350
want to be like no this is the outdoor

517
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:09,049
commodity price and then sell it for

518
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:11,869
five times what you bought it for as

519
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:13,789
endure that doesn't feel fair to me or

520
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:16,539
the person who's buying it on the other

521
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:16,539
end you know

522
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:28,319
you build upon that's all in the service

523
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:31,409
of a brand enterprise that's not all

524
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:36,798
that's like that's your future like

525
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:36,799
whatever you need to do to survive yeah

526
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:43,240
building on those things is all building

527
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:46,559
on branding and especially yeah that are

528
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,589
pork that's great

529
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,700
which which you you will be successful

530
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:54,079
to beauty

531
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:57,080
we've been doing those things and it's

532
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:01,189
been growing for sure yeah yeah I mean

533
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:03,069
none of us had farm brands also one of

534
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:06,680
the things that we find is interesting

535
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:11,349
in in branding ourselves and marketing

536
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:13,850
ourselves as we appeal to you know

537
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:16,759
connoisseurs and most of the

538
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:24,619
connoisseurs in Northern California work

539
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:26,359
in the cannabis industry forms that you

540
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:28,309
guys put off and even other people I

541
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,279
think the similary I see there though is

542
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:33,169
is the care for the environment the kiss

543
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,529
stewardship of the lamp also care for

544
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:38,990
the plant and for producing really

545
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:41,240
quality herb having that be a big part

546
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:43,400
of the equation and like I feel like

547
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,309
getting out I don't think we're gonna be

548
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,110
like as a society that's just like

549
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:50,470
humans were not gonna go anywhere unless

550
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:54,259
we start focusing on quality in general

551
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:57,589
just and that's and the thing that's

552
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:59,710
scary and is that the majority of people

553
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:03,428
will always trade

554
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:07,000
minions for quality and so how do we

555
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:10,028
change that you know because at the

556
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,960
retail level what happens is they have

557
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:16,359
lots of people that come in for the

558
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,929
cheapest thing and very few people that

559
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:22,148
come in for a more expensive thing so if

560
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:25,720
they pay the farmer a fair price to do a

561
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:28,269
small batch quality product and then

562
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,548
they add all the middleman cost of all

563
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:32,589
the crazy taxes regulation all the stuff

564
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:35,648
not just normal middleman costs and then

565
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:38,199
it's finally in the packaging too

566
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:40,048
because it has to be this ridiculous it

567
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,429
has to be a childproof there's only like

568
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:44,230
so many suppliers and all stuff so you

569
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:48,038
get to the final like it's ready for the

570
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:51,220
shelf and then they're selling by the

571
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:53,769
jar and these retail stores are not

572
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,409
mostly not that large like what we're

573
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:57,759
looking at and their model is like if

574
00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:00,880
you were to compare to something else

575
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:03,369
it'd be more like a Walgreens or CVS

576
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:09,549
then it would be like a fine wine shop

577
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:13,329
and so it's it's about yeah but it's

578
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:16,298
it's just just still happening it's just

579
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:18,009
still being creative yeah Jesus

580
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:18,889
difficult because there's so many

581
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:21,048
players

582
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:23,540
I know for a fact because I've been here

583
00:27:21,048 --> 00:27:25,730
for the last five years talking to all

584
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:28,190
these people and marketing people to

585
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,849
mainstream people coming in is that

586
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:33,590
there are entities out there big time

587
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:36,169
marking entities that have more money

588
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:38,019
than we can ever dream of that will that

589
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:41,590
will be working

590
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:44,980
these large commercial grows and they

591
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:47,740
will be out there marketing the language

592
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,720
in the narrative organic simple and fall

593
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,400
down these buds were it sustainable

594
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,410
which you'll already see Clark

595
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:57,970
commercials

596
00:27:52,410 --> 00:28:00,730
oh yeah well so yeah doesn't mean that

597
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:03,009
you can't regain the meaning of that to

598
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:06,599
me you know give up that fight at all

599
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:06,599
but that's the truth

600
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,460
like there's a small forest there's

601
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,970
nothing you can do about that I know

602
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,970
this

603
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:24,579
they're called flower up in Canada FL

604
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:27,009
OWR massive hydroponics

605
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:31,240
and I've been told that the guy who runs

606
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:34,420
it is a hydroponics and what they plan

607
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,799
to do is to put very high-end top and

608
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:40,259
microphonic flour of lots of it

609
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:50,609
now what I think is any top dollar is

610
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:53,069
nothing on the planet no exactly that's

611
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:55,049
where well the thing in that that I

612
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:59,069
always think of is like when you're

613
00:28:55,049 --> 00:29:01,349
doing indoor you can do it anywhere it's

614
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:03,869
not California weed anymore you know

615
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:05,879
what I mean and like now that we're

616
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:07,529
getting into this legalization that's a

617
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,820
reality that like you're cowley

618
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:15,000
California indoor is is just indoor and

619
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:18,240
now your indoor has to be better than

620
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,619
somebody from Canada or like the small

621
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,730
growers who are going to come out of the

622
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:22,729
Midwest to like

623
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:38,710
yeah thank you no well like people care

624
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:41,749
about weed and the thing about weed is

625
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,608
it reflects that you know what I mean

626
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:46,999
they're not going to be able like

627
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:52,099
whatever they think is top-shelf isn't

628
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:54,470
actually gonna meet the like somebody

629
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:56,839
who really cares about weed there's more

630
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,329
in it than that it's a special

631
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,238
mysterious plant you know they mean the

632
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:03,658
side of what I believe is that cannabis

633
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:07,058
fur

634
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:08,679
so so for your cannabis people they do

635
00:30:07,058 --> 00:30:14,069
care about quality and it's an

636
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:14,070
aspiration yeah and most families

637
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:19,778
a person who thinks they're a

638
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:22,359
connoisseur who thinks that what they're

639
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:24,519
there that they like the best

640
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:26,709
whether they do or not it's but then

641
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,359
there's they also the because I used to

642
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:32,259
be this person to where I was like I

643
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:32,918
love wheat I will smoke any wheat you

644
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:37,408
give me

645
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:39,640
I love wheat you know what I mean but in

646
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:46,028
smoking all the different kinds of weed

647
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:48,549
I got to know what was like what do I

648
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:50,859
like you know what I mean what am i

649
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:52,658
stoked on when I get that because

650
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:54,428
because I and I know I'm not gonna make

651
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:56,440
me get that next time you know what I

652
00:30:54,429 --> 00:31:01,140
mean because it because it was the black

653
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,140
market and you get what you get right so

654
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:10,000
you know I think it'll it'll get figured

655
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:12,900
out because it does get figured out yeah

656
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:23,880
I just I just think

657
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:25,890
I know totally and we have relationships

658
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,960
with retailers who care about our

659
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:31,230
product and we care about their store

660
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,930
and and you know and that's I just

661
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,849
that's a good working with so soulful

662
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:42,019
and we have a good relationship with

663
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:44,039
them and we've you know we've had

664
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:45,990
different we've had a lot of different

665
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:47,940
distributors we've gone through and so

666
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,890
just depending on the distributor they

667
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,320
let you cultivate those relationships or

668
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:54,179
not but some of them don't and so that's

669
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,029
a big challenge to or it's like how do i

670
00:31:54,179 --> 00:32:00,600
cultivate these relationships when I

671
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:03,690
can't be the person distributing it or

672
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:08,909
like even giving them samples you know I

673
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:11,490
mean it's and that those are those are

674
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,380
really difficult complications and so

675
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,349
you have to find somebody who's really

676
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,380
support it supportive of your stuff and

677
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:22,589
it's like you know and so it's good too

678
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,780
right now I feel like I mean for

679
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:27,480
everybody it seems good it's good to

680
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:29,460
team up with people and so we can all

681
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,450
raise awareness for each other because

682
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:36,360
we're all small come like we're not even

683
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:41,580
companies some of us and like we're out

684
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:43,849
just all small farms and small small

685
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:48,419
producers in the Emerald triangle who

686
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:50,939
you know like do a good job but we get

687
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,890
word or not allowed to to do the

688
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,799
outreach that we otherwise would like

689
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:58,290
for to have a booth at the Emerald cup

690
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:02,269
we were like we had an opportunity to

691
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:06,420
get a booth but the the amount of

692
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:09,000
investment that would go have to go into

693
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:13,740
just getting the booth because of the

694
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:17,200
regulatory you know burdens was like

695
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,549
it's it's just not even feasible you

696
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,200
know what I mean because you have to

697
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:26,619
like well we could have one strain you

698
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,330
know baby but like you have to have you

699
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:29,799
either are gonna have to like put in

700
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:33,189
what you think you're gonna sell and

701
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,720
have those all tested which is like all

702
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:36,430
those varieties have to have this or you

703
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,470
have to have it all finished by then to

704
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:42,220
have it all tested and all and then it

705
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,960
all has to go to one place you can't

706
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:49,000
really move from that up place very

707
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:51,009
easily supply people up here and they

708
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,210
want it it's all stuck over there like

709
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:54,549
that kind of stuff happens so it's

710
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,740
constantly with every batch every

711
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:59,049
strange so every and it's not even

712
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,180
anybody's fault it's even when they're

713
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:06,730
trying to get it to them and doing the

714
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:08,769
best they can yeah they were and they

715
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,960
they were made specifically by certain

716
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:13,119
people to get a certain outcome and part

717
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,920
of that outcome is for us not to be able

718
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,150
to control our supplies they are not

719
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,269
serving the interest

720
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:20,940
I mean it's making it very difficult if

721
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:24,949
it's there

722
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,950
for you to get a smile

723
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,649
you know poor farmers life - coming down

724
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:35,710
yeah but the Emerald cup isn't

725
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:37,628
prohibitive it's not necessarily it's

726
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,490
not the cup you know it's like they

727
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:41,259
actually are helpful with the contest

728
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,428
and expense sending deadlines and all

729
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,260
these things you know what I mean they

730
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:49,300
definitely are like

731
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:58,510
supportive of the farmers but like yeah

732
00:34:49,300 --> 00:35:01,030
it's crazy that the res inventory no I

733
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:05,200
mean it commodifies the supply and it

734
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:06,880
allows us no control over our product as

735
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,500
it moves up the supply chain and it

736
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,300
doesn't allow us to retain its true

737
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:15,099
value and allows other people to

738
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:17,230
capitalize on our value and so you know

739
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:20,170
as a small independent producer with not

740
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:23,619
a 200 million dollar investment capital

741
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:26,349
or marketing budget or whatever and you

742
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:28,568
know reach to like all these you know

743
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:30,130
with like processing and all these

744
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:32,650
things you have to have know is like

745
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,720
most small producers in the mo triangle

746
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,309
can't process on their farm anymore

747
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:37,439
without getting

748
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:39,599
and circle moving because they're not in

749
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,900
the right zoning for that India that we

750
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,549
can do at least do our own trim trimming

751
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,170
well like it's not necessarily

752
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,240
processing but we can do trimming and

753
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,220
packaging and you dry see if you don't

754
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,709
actually have to hire a bunch of

755
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:54,869
employees they are letting you do some

756
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:58,110
processing on small farms and Trinity

757
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:59,699
and in Mendocino they're not there even

758
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:02,370
their small farmers aren't being allowed

759
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:04,769
to even do their you know like what a

760
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:07,409
small home business scale would should

761
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:09,869
be allowed to do they're not they've

762
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:11,489
taken that away from us they've they're

763
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:12,719
treating us like it doesn't matter how

764
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:18,029
small you are you're like this

765
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:20,279
industrial like huge impact and you

766
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:24,140
could be doing it that way so I

767
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,670
recognize why those things are there but

768
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:28,170
there's no differentiation between us

769
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:31,320
and them and what we have to do to

770
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:34,079
operate and so just our ability to

771
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,110
really be a true small craft producer

772
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,079
and keep our own value and make our own

773
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:41,880
value-added products like I used to make

774
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,860
medicines of all kinds that were

775
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,990
handcrafted from start to finish in tiny

776
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,760
batches with wild crafted other plants

777
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:49,379
and like really medicinal products that

778
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,360
I can't make without a commercial

779
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,880
kitchen and separate license it's a

780
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,769
separate manufacturing thing than the

781
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,360
hash so we couldn't even even if we did

782
00:36:55,769 --> 00:37:02,940
all that they'd have really it'd be

783
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:04,410
insane you know and so there's already a

784
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:08,659
lot of stuff we used to do that

785
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:11,609
consumers have no access to now yeah and

786
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:13,409
there might be medical stuff where it's

787
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:16,140
like we could still provide medicine but

788
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:19,349
I don't know it's very it's been very

789
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:21,210
frustrating for for every I think

790
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:24,420
everybody on every side you know and

791
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:26,750
even the consumer like oh yeah with the

792
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,750
supply

793
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:57,559
and even to just help support be like

794
00:37:54,849 --> 00:38:01,220
somebody's like I know weed I'm gonna go

795
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:03,529
get the job that helps would good we'd

796
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:11,000
get on out there you know like for

797
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:12,500
people you know anymore that was the

798
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,690
first thing I learned I was editing a

799
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,849
magazine a different business magazine

800
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:18,119
covers from all aspects for the last

801
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:20,740
five years

802
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,969
we in short order island

803
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:30,509
I was talking to a legislator a CEO a

804
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:30,509
cultivator everything was was about edge

805
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:37,170
yeah that's right so that's kind of why

806
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,509
we even applied for the regenerative

807
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:41,940
farm award and even showed up at them

808
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:44,160
World Cup and like do all this stuff was

809
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,769
because we're like this is really this

810
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:51,719
is something I could actually really get

811
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:55,889
behind and the more platforms there are

812
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:57,719
to reach people the better and I mean

813
00:38:55,889 --> 00:39:01,379
you just have to be authentic about it

814
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:06,599
and hope that I do get I do get a lot of

815
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:08,700
feedback from people who who say they

816
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:12,559
can tell the difference between just

817
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:16,109
like other corporate kind of marketing

818
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:19,199
greenwashing and stuff and us and our

819
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:21,539
reef art that we're you know they really

820
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:25,649
see the reef the real authenticity

821
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:28,679
behind what I'll let just us but all

822
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:31,320
over all of us and so I think consumers

823
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:36,779
are starting to seek that out and try

824
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:39,030
and and you know it's just it's kind of

825
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:43,380
that game of time that

826
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:45,360
but we can we can keep educating a lot

827
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,460
of people haven't ever gotten to try

828
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:50,700
really amazing cannabis they have no

829
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,289
idea what it would be like it's true and

830
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:56,179
in parts of a lot of parts of the

831
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:56,179
country it's still really difficult

832
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:24,739
really uncommon you know very suited how

833
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:24,739
much like the eye

834
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,329
you know

835
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:59,730
you're reading

836
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,210
right okay flower for the not only in

837
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:06,699
this country

838
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:10,000
yeah yeah we are that's really really

839
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:13,779
where we're really like our sites are

840
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,519
really set like on a few humps over you

841
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,960
know I there's a few more hills still in

842
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,210
between but like you're looking over

843
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,990
there and that's really where we all

844
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:26,170
should be focused for sure and and

845
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:27,459
direct-to-consumer for sure be we used

846
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:31,119
to talk about this all the time it's

847
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:33,639
like we need hundreds dedicated stoners

848
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,760
or whatever you know like like it's not

849
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:38,739
gonna be in every it's not gonna be safe

850
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,770
way wine it's not gonna be everywhere

851
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:44,189
and so part of it is finding the people

852
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:46,809
the niche the people who really care you

853
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:48,460
know there's a little market down

854
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:52,119
well we just moved but a little market

855
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,710
it's in LA nonnamous market on the

856
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:55,170
corner

857
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,420
and I go they have it is a mostly

858
00:41:55,170 --> 00:42:02,358
pointer but they have a special bro

859
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:06,450
inception before fear and likely using

860
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:11,190
InDesign bottles now for those bottles

861
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:26,789
in yeah I think there's gonna be more

862
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:33,450
and more of that the best champagnes and

863
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:35,779
France are grown on a quarter acre we'll

864
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:35,779
get there
