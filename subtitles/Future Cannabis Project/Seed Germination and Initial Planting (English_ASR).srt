1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:07,839
all right next round of autos

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:11,280
heading over to tom's house

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,160
uh the humbled seed company magic melon

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,160
auto femme

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,960
uh

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,359
boom so

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,800
i just actually these things

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,800
popped quickly but

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,719
let's just make life easy

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:45,840
what's up what's up taproots

11
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:53,349
[Music]

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
um

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
all right

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,370
all right

15
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:15,369
[Music]

16
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:24,559
[Music]

17
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,680
two

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,680
we got

19
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:35,519
three

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,840
oh my god

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,840
okay you guys are all done done

22
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,510
[Music]

23
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,318
it's pretty much all pops i don't see

24
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,318
any ones that didn't pop

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,640
it's a good germination rate 100 it's a

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,080
good number

27
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,839
i think there were 12 seeds so i need to

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,000
make some more solo cups

29
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,598
so it's a 10 pack there are actually

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
11 seeds in there and every single one

31
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,000
popped

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,159
so we're just

33
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:54,479
there's gonna one

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
get off my finger

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:05,840
and another one

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,519
and another one

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,640
this is to feed tom's voracious

38
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:22,878
weed appetite

39
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,878
i'll give some to other people

40
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:33,759
a little magic melon auto

41
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:38,560
all right that might be the last one

42
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:47,840
and that's it all right

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:47,840
little silk

44
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,480
we're pretty much done for the day with

45
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,480
you

46
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:15,840
all right

47
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,599
all right

48
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:32,159
so i put all 11 seeds and solo cups

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,319
each cup is just in a

50
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
super mix which pretty much has no

51
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,399
nutrients

52
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:41,679
and i was going to

53
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,319
inoculate it with some mycorrhizae but

54
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,240
what i realized

55
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:51,279
is that in the non-active side of my

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,680
compost tumbler is the side that i'm not

57
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,799
adding

58
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:02,478
new food scraps too

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,478
uh i don't know if you can see

60
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,680
yeah right there we got some mushrooms

61
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,639
growing

62
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,199
so i'm just going to harvest some of

63
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,199
this stuff

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,519
and put it in each solo cup

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,360
so i'm just going to take this and break

66
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,479
it apart

67
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,800
and uh put a little bit in every

68
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:32,800
cup

69
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,560
it's kind of hard with one hand but

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,240
anyway

71
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,959
you get the gist and then i'll put some

72
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,759
water in

73
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,758
and i mean

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,839
there's some mycorrhizae

75
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,918
so

76
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,840
you can see all the

77
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:15,038
there you got some bugs breaking down

78
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,039
the compost

79
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,079
anyway and i'll do a better job once i

80
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,079
can use two hands but

81
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,399
there's my

82
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,879
fungal activity in a

83
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,160
mix that doesn't really have any

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,399
nutrients in it so

85
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,400
let's get started anyway

86
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,840
stuff just smells like rich earth

87
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,839
it's a very satisfying smell

88
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,679
all right so i'm just finishing kind of

89
00:06:53,519 --> 00:07:02,879
crumbling up

90
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:06,478
the mycorrhizae

91
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,478
and then

92
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:17,840
now we'll just give it all

93
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:33,680
light water in

94
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,680
and

95
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,319
i'll let you hang out in the shade

96
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,359
so actually i'm just going to put the

97
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:50,160
rest in with my

98
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,160
winter squash that i just popped

99
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,199
this is like three quarters of the way

100
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:04,160
composted material we've got a little

101
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,280
chicken bone put that back in the

102
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,680
composter

103
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,679
or actually we'll just put you

104
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,758
by we'll see you

105
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,759
when we see you

106
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:24,159
anyway so this is now

107
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:27,840
has some fungal activity keep it moist

108
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
moist moist baby
