00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,589
Lance Lambert coming here from Barcelona

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,289
Spain for spannabis 2019 we're on the

4
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:21,600
final day here I've got a special guest

5
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,570
next to me Nick Denham

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,849
he is a true master of rasen was a

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,140
recent judge of the Masters arroz in

8
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,879
which we sponsored that just went down

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,759
last night but it's been kind of a

10
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:35,640
week-long thing did welcome give thanks

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,250
for having me man just blessed to be out

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,520
here in Spain for real the masters of

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,500
rosin has kept me high for a week

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,059
seriously the amount of entries the

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,450
amount of quality entries that I wanted

16
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:51,359
to go back and retry has been insane you

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,699
know a lot of quality increase since

18
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,159
last year the year before just traumatic

19
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,198
quality increases out here in Spain well

20
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,849
now and man it's funny because although

21
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:01,289
you look like a younger guy to the game

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,120
you've been doing it for a minute we

23
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,250
were talking we're talking a few decades

24
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,840
and being a colleague I - which

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,150
obviously you're close to the source of

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,770
some quality in itself yeah you know

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,799
I've been doing this more than half my

28
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,509
life this is my life I'm super blessed

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,280
to have parents and family that

30
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,799
supported everything that I've done all

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,228
the moves that I've made I started

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,540
operating in Colorado back in 2009 and

33
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:26,519
started the first tax-paying hash

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,250
company in the u.s. essential extracts

35
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,929
I'm just blessed to still be here dad my

36
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,219
man and I recognize that name once I had

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,200
to kind of put it all together we were

38
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,179
talking about similar ties for our

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,210
California Colorado back to California

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,740
for both of us and in knowing that we

41
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,719
recognize the differences in the market

42
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,188
over there how do they compare though to

43
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,228
what you're seeing here you talked about

44
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,489
such things are getting better but how

45
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:51,359
is it compared to back home would you

46
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:55,048
say fresh I mean the increase in quality

47
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:58,049
this year is insane it's creating a

48
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,299
competing market to the US really and

49
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,219
we're seeing it you know like not to put

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,380
anybody on blast but we see a lot of US

51
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:05,259
companies bringing product out here to

52
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:07,030
Spain

53
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,159
and last year I think a lot of the

54
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,020
California flowers here in Spain were

55
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:12,549
selling really really well this year I'm

56
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,380
looking for the local flowers because

57
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,520
the local growers are stepping up game

58
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:19,599
seriously so yeah I'm seeing the same

59
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,550
thing man and that's one thing I was

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,810
just talking to a friend over loud seeds

61
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,790
and he was kind of talking about the

62
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,800
whole convert yeah yeah yep you know

63
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:29,709
James and talking about the whole fact

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,660
that you know you've got these genetics

65
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,950
guys that are coming down from from the

66
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:34,689
Netherlands these guys who are coming

67
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:36,339
out from the west coast and just just

68
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:38,439
collabing not competing but collabing

69
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,710
right and as something that's carrying

70
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,030
into obviously into your craft as well

71
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,189
definitely definitely you know people

72
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,300
out here are really really hunting fee

73
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:48,159
knows it's something that I've noticed

74
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,689
that the European market really does is

75
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,669
they're popping a lot more seeds than

76
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:53,560
we're popping in the US especially in

77
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:55,899
places like Morocco and places where

78
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,360
they have a large agricultural area that

79
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,300
can do such things we're seeing of

80
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,340
amazing female hunts and with that comes

81
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,189
fee knows that are yielding way better

82
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,500
in hash so I mean you know big up my

83
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:11,379
friends at Lok colada big up grateful

84
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,180
seeds big up la Sagrada fam a lot of

85
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:15,280
these cats are really really pushing the

86
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,170
boundaries of what they can do out here

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,629
and they're finding amazing fee notes

88
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:21,369
that are really really proper for

89
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:22,659
solving this hash do that and that's

90
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,090
excellent to hear and for some of you to

91
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,620
do a bit of homework Gino is one factory

92
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,689
the whole genotype of the phenotype is

93
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,670
next level and exactly an x-point it

94
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:32,409
just brings so much more craft to the

95
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,208
culture just brings so much more flavor

96
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:36,310
to the experience because it's not about

97
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,900
the race to the top and THD that's a

98
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,060
furthest a lot of us that really respect

99
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,280
this plant wanted to be about so tell me

100
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,469
again I mean you're a master in your own

101
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,060
right what are some of the other hash

102
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,259
makers or who I should say even more so

103
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,390
are some of the other hash makers you

104
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:51,969
almost kind of look up to or maybe

105
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:54,639
mentored a little bit from out there um

106
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:56,680
you know out here actually in Europe one

107
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,049
of my mentors and one of the women that

108
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,450
taught me so much about making hash is

109
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,850
Mila Jansen they call her the hash queen

110
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:06,250
so big up Mila each and every time you

111
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:08,469
know I've learned so much from so many

112
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,199
different generations back in the day

113
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:14,340
full melt bubble mark aka bubble man's

114
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,469
website was a huge learning source

115
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,780
more recently about 10 12 years ago we

116
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,870
created a website and forum called

117
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,219
extract artists which I've been teaching

118
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,360
in but I've also been learning in you

119
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,490
know there's a lot of different avenues

120
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,520
I think that we've we've all been

121
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,978
learning via a lot of oral tradition you

122
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,750
know originally when I first went out to

123
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:35,639
Amsterdam to study under miele in the

124
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,129
early 2000s there wasn't anything

125
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,050
written about this I had to go bug Mila

126
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:41,639
in her shop in her production facility

127
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,870
and be like hey you know how do I get to

128
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,610
this color how do I get to this

129
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,709
consistency is this rinsing thing that

130
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,560
I'm doing good you know and and nowadays

131
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:51,689
we tour all throughout the world Mila

132
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,370
and I teaching each other and teaching

133
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,709
people as well you know Mila gives me

134
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,569
credit for bringing fresh frozen and the

135
00:04:55,709 --> 00:05:00,000
idea of running fresh frozen material to

136
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,740
Europe and I really give her a lot more

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,009
credit than that a lot of the credit

138
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,978
came from Mila for the whole rinsing

139
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:10,349
thing just briefly mentioned but the

140
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:12,689
technology of rinsing your hash after

141
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,340
you've collected your hash back in the

142
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:16,649
day when I learned that is really really

143
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:18,418
up my game you get rid of a lot of the

144
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,769
impurities by rinsing out those

145
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,879
trichomes after you've collected them

146
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,740
and that's one of the texts that I

147
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,060
learned from Mila that's cool man and

148
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,310
you mentioned fresh frozen which is

149
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,350
something that it's almost can I take

150
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,240
him back home not too big on Kalle but I

151
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,919
see I become a more popular seems to be

152
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,389
it guys it's a little bit easier to turn

153
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,379
the crops if they're able to just set

154
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:35,819
some stuff now there's a whole

155
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,469
refrigerator I mean it's a whole other

156
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:38,909
category right as far as being able to

157
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,080
have a place refrigerate but you're

158
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,220
probably like fresh frozen we're seeing

159
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,348
more of that I mean I talked to one of

160
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,750
our friends as growers 25% of his crop

161
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:46,709
went straight to the chillers so that's

162
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,329
something you're seeing more of - in

163
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:50,129
your space yeah there's a number of

164
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:52,409
reasons we're seeing more of it number

165
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:54,930
one we're able to take a cultivation and

166
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,760
go in there and help consult and get rid

167
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,340
of an entire room where they're trimming

168
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,959
and drying material right all of these

169
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,848
employees that don't actually work for

170
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,500
them but are coming in on a hire basis

171
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:07,250
to trim the material that you know

172
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,389
creates a lot more issues with theft and

173
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,029
quality control and things like that you

174
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:13,829
get rid of all of them we can turn that

175
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:15,929
room into another flowering room or a

176
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:17,969
mom's stable to keep all your genetics

177
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,519
right you're not having to pay all those

178
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,960
trimmers and we're bucking the material

179
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,598
straight from the fuckin field right

180
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,198
into a freezer so it saves a lot of time

181
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:27,399
and a lot of money for the grower

182
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,278
that's one of the big things that we're

183
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,109
promoting and you know it's crazy to

184
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:34,509
talk about fresh frozen cuz I think it

185
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,550
really started in Colorado with that

186
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:39,038
legal market and the regulated system

187
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:42,069
out there kind of pushed towards fresh

188
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,288
frozen and then the live rep Rose Live

189
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,699
resin guys grabbed it right after we

190
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:48,128
started promoting it and saying hey

191
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:50,139
we're running live fresh material

192
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:51,939
they're like oh shit maybe we could run

193
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,038
that in our closed loops and now we're

194
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:55,870
seeing the live resin the live rosin and

195
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,579
it's really cool to see those are some

196
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,468
of my friends on the live resin side

197
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:01,838
that kind of coined the term live resin

198
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:03,728
and I got nothing but love for them it's

199
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,978
just creating higher quality for the

200
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:07,748
whole industry so big up fresh frozen

201
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:09,519
heats and every time for real you're

202
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:11,800
retaining a lot more terpenes when

203
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,878
you're using fresh frozen especially

204
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,370
when you have a lot more of these air

205
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,620
volatile terpenes the gassy terpenes the

206
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,899
Kem's the diesels those are escaping

207
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,579
immediately if you fresh freeze that

208
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:23,468
material we're able to lock those in a

209
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,778
lot easier and I've noticed here that's

210
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:27,848
exact

211
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:29,709
exactly got the rise into my pocket it's

212
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,759
all about the fresh frozen your point

213
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:32,859
because it's just a totally different

214
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,509
from a turkey standpoint for someone who

215
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,710
appreciates really I know it's a

216
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:38,288
played-out term but the full spectrum

217
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:40,180
not just again all about the the you

218
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:42,250
know loudness of the cannabinoids it

219
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,598
really does preserve that and you don't

220
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,918
lose it through the rest of the process

221
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,259
like you said so that's awesome to hear

222
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:49,209
so what are talked about some of the

223
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,098
different styles whose mentored you

224
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:52,750
what's your style like what what is it

225
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:54,338
you mentioned rinsing but I'm sure

226
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,228
there's a few other jump to share all

227
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:57,908
the secret sauce but but what have you

228
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:59,468
found to really make your own to make

229
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:02,079
you so unique and as popular as you've

230
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:04,949
done and become really you know I think

231
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:08,198
a lot of it is my openness my my

232
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:09,879
communication skills is I think a big

233
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,800
part of it you know because I think

234
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,539
there's a lot of amazing hash makers out

235
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,788
there but I don't know if all of them

236
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:17,889
have really utilized their skill and

237
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:19,509
promoted what they're doing and really

238
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,949
taught you know the industry and that's

239
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:23,430
really what I pride myself on is

240
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:25,590
creating a higher echelon for the end of

241
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,720
and not just teaching the people that

242
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,698
want to learn but I mean I'm teaching

243
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,278
what people are calling competitive

244
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,440
companies and they're not competitive to

245
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,240
me the more education that's out there

246
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,039
the more that those competitive

247
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,560
companies are also teaching solvent less

248
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,059
methodology the more my product sells so

249
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,000
I think one of the things that's really

250
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,549
you know made me stand apart is my

251
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,589
willingness to teach and learn the same

252
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:51,778
way you know I'm not ever gonna stop

253
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:53,430
learning myself so that's where I'm at

254
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,860
man I'm just I'm just blessed to be here
