3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,510
we start talking about block J now I was

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,039
thinking about this in preparation for

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,590
this panel

6
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,210
you know I've I've been doing technology

7
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,710
development for the last 20 years which

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,579
basically means that for the last 20

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,009
years I've been hearing

10
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,199
middle-management spew buzzwords at me

11
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:43,890
about the latest technology that we need

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,109
to integrate into into the into the

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,780
solutions and it's made me really bitter

14
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:51,329
in a lot of ways you know I can rattle

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,130
off a list of a lot of technologies that

16
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,269
you've probably heard acronyms for that

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,940
don't know a whole lot more other than

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,390
the name of I think there's a lot that

19
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,500
we can we can blame that for I don't

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,200
know how many of you are familiar with a

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,450
concept called Moore's Law it's a

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,368
concept in computer science it's a

23
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,170
concept and technology period basically

24
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,319
what it comes down to is it dictates

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,590
that the speed and capacity of any

26
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,618
technology will double approximately

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,810
every 18 months ever since the advent of

28
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:26,250
personal computer and the internet

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,010
that's been something that's been pretty

30
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,319
steady if you look at processor speeds

31
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,030
if you look at the internet speed

32
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,379
Moore's Law has been a pretty good

33
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,129
indicator of how things are gonna

34
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,298
progress and it's created this this

35
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:42,118
culture of the shiny new object

36
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,799
in technology it's created this culture

37
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,829
of well I'm using technology that's 2

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,210
years old and and this my new guy this

39
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,319
24 year old who just started working for

40
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,359
me is trying to sell me on this new

41
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,539
technology that just came out it must be

42
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,938
better it's 2 years newer let's move to

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,060
that right and so you know for the

44
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,589
purpose of you know this conversation I

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,990
was joking with these guys that I'm

46
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,670
gonna play devil's advocate a little bit

47
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:07,618
and because of the fact that you know

48
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,118
really if I've had a nickel for every

49
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:10,379
time someone told me that blockchain was

50
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:11,909
in a solve every problem I had and my

51
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,879
software company I would be retired by

52
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:17,280
now so let's we're gonna take some time

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,560
to figure out what's going on with that

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,539
what's really real what's important

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,729
what's what are the real applications of

56
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:28,859
this technology and what's not so from a

57
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:32,280
friend of perspective of a technologist

58
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,700
for me I look at blockchain

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,318
a modern-day example of what we've

60
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:39,359
always referred to as a datastore right

61
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,208
like as a database when it comes down to

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,470
it it's a digital ledger to distributed

63
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,590
ledger and it's a place where you can

64
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:48,689
store data and and reference it later on

65
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,950
so the first question I want to ask the

66
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:51,870
panel and give these guys all a chance

67
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:52,708
to answer is what differentiates

68
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,670
blockchain

69
00:02:52,709 --> 00:03:00,000
what makes blockchain different better

70
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:02,699
and more applicable to the issues that

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,629
you're each facing on a day-to-day we'll

72
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:08,759
start with Ken so I think the primary

73
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,979
value of blockchain technology is the

74
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,049
firm a transaction perspective is the

75
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,689
absence of third-party intermediaries

76
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,580
finding financial intermediaries so when

77
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:19,079
you think about you know processing a

78
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,730
traditional payment it goes through

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,640
multiple layers probably about seven

80
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,289
different parties we need when you

81
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,299
compare that to that of the blockchain

82
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,679
you know it's it's a transaction that's

83
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,180
occurring between you and the other

84
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,659
individual I think that you know being

85
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,750
able to have the decentralized model

86
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:41,459
allows each person to become their own

87
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,639
bank and have full control of their own

88
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,680
money and and without all the expenses

89
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,969
the cost that it associated with you

90
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,150
know paying each individual in that

91
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:54,739
transaction stream from Trent that's

92
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,739
just from a transactional perspective

93
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,879
all right sure I'm thinking of it a

94
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:04,140
little bit more from what you mentioned

95
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:06,780
as a new type of database you know we so

96
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,268
at ages for looking at cannabis data

97
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,060
from a couple of different angles one is

98
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,069
that you've got everywhere from

99
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,798
manufacturers testing facilities

100
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,108
dispensaries really collecting a lot of

101
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,019
extremely valuable data data that's both

102
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,269
valuable to them in a business sense as

103
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,250
well as potentially a valuable source

104
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:28,500
for medical findings for research

105
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,449
findings I mean I think the billion

106
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,389
dollar question right now this industry

107
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:36,478
is matching up a specific person or

108
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:38,579
their needs with a specific strain which

109
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,839
is really a specific set of chemical

110
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:44,609
compounds that best help them so unlike

111
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,198
many other medical industries we don't

112
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,538
have an NIH Institute

113
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,090
that's doing this for us and I think the

114
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,620
blockchain is a really great way to

115
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,628
organize this data in a way that

116
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,579
everyone can contribute the data in

117
00:04:54,629 --> 00:05:00,930
exchange for returning data back or

118
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:02,788
returning results back and at Ages were

119
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,978
also really interested in kind of the

120
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:07,978
bottom-up approach which is collecting

121
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:10,168
that data and everyone knows that their

122
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:12,389
data is valuable these days it's just

123
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:14,278
most people understand they don't get

124
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:16,590
paid for it they get their free service

125
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:19,038
it exchange for personal information and

126
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:21,508
I think there's a chance to couple the

127
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,639
transactional potential potential of the

128
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,990
blockchain with a way to actually

129
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,879
collect some of these data from

130
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,009
individuals in a way that we can

131
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,490
incentivize them and reward them for the

132
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:34,680
sharing yeah you know I was fortunate

133
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,620
enough to be part of the web hosting and

134
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,199
domain industry back in the early 2000s

135
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,050
when we had Oracle databases and

136
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,400
Microsoft and sequel databases and now

137
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,228
we look at the stored value of data

138
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,478
which is blockchain and being able to

139
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:50,068
utilize that capture it and have it in

140
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,778
place where you can't alter it unless

141
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:53,729
you change the hash it's gonna enable

142
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:55,800
people to be successful in a way where

143
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,508
they can utilize that data over and over

144
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,038
again without having to have the

145
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:04,949
hindrance of big data cumbersome

146
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:06,870
companies coming in to really alter my

147
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:08,490
business plan like a Microsoft or an

148
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,709
Oracle so now we all can become our own

149
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,509
Microsoft and Oracle to develop these

150
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:14,758
products for our customers on a very

151
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:17,158
quick basis and that's really that the

152
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,930
agile development that blockchain gives

153
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:21,478
us in order to deliver the right product

154
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,019
to this industry in particular I want to

155
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:28,258
stick with you banking is an area that I

156
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:31,348
think most of people are very intrigued

157
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,658
about as far as how blockchain can help

158
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:34,949
I mean it's a it's a widespread problem

159
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:37,620
I was talking to my team about this

160
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,509
today you know I've had individuals just

161
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,610
today two separate individuals on my

162
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,889
team have to transport thousands of

163
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,649
dollars in cash to a bank right and

164
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,478
we're not dealing with the same level of

165
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:50,189
currency that we're talking about for a

166
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,228
day-to-day dispensary operation so I can

167
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:55,528
only imagine how you know how

168
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:57,838
nerve-racking that is for those teams so

169
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:59,699
you know obviously mark you you can

170
00:06:57,838 --> 00:07:01,740
speak to this a little bit as far as

171
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,069
a transfer of value a banking solution

172
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,300
you know what led you to the solution

173
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:07,319
that you're working on right now what

174
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,600
was the problem that you first

175
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,930
identified and what led you to the

176
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,390
blockchain as a solution yeah really

177
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,550
banking is is not the problem it's the

178
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:19,889
cost of banking that's the problem is

179
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,750
really what it is that the compliance

180
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:24,029
and the rules that you have to follow

181
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,069
which are set 2014 FinCEN came out with

182
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:27,719
rules to follow how I got it is my

183
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,550
backgrounds actually technology and

184
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,170
private equity funding I had a group

185
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,150
come to me they wanted to invest in one

186
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,230
of my projects I was so excited I'm like

187
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:37,139
this is gonna be amazing

188
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,879
and they go okay I go here's my terms

189
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,800
loved it here's my contract they loved

190
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,509
it and I said here's my wire information

191
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,650
and they go why don't you come out to

192
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:44,099
the farm and we'll spend a little time

193
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,629
together

194
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,060
they showed me more cash I've ever seen

195
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:49,829
in my life in one spot I go let's get it

196
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,879
to the bank and put it to work like Lots

197
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:53,189
our problem we don't have a bank account

198
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,139
and I couldn't figure it out I was I'm

199
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:57,509
not from the cannabis industry and I was

200
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,180
like okay I can figure this out well

201
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,889
then after months and months of finding

202
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,750
that it's a serious problem for not just

203
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:06,149
these folks but you know everybody in

204
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,500
the industry I was fortunate enough to

205
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:09,120
find a company called integrated

206
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,860
integrated compliance solutions that

207
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,410
does AML and kyc and and VSA software

208
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,629
for banks today and I go this is amazing

209
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,890
so I became a venture partner and they

210
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:22,199
go you know one of our biggest problems

211
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,810
is the ability to move payments from

212
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,000
what from b2b selections and capturing

213
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:30,389
that known source of funds for that and

214
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,090
I go okay and so hence c2 was born and

215
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:36,750
that's why we chose blockchain to solve

216
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:42,240
that problem got it great Ken I know you

217
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:44,009
guys focus a lot on and all 36 you have

218
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,750
a lot of focus on the consumer

219
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:47,220
experience as far as the transaction

220
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,509
from the I know you do other things as

221
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,600
well but there's a lot of focus on the

222
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:55,470
consumer experience and also I would

223
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,450
have to say that this crypto as a

224
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,790
solution to a lack of credit card

225
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,970
processing is one of the pitches that I

226
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,839
hear most often when it comes to

227
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,509
blockchain so you know what

228
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,009
differentiates to all 36 you know why

229
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:10,110
why have you guys been able to achieve

230
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,250
the amount of success that you have so

231
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,029
you've probably heard a lot of pitches

232
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,220
do too

233
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:16,409
the increase in icos in the market

234
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,090
initial coin offerings so a lot of

235
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:21,120
projects have come up in the market that

236
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:24,000
have created and velop their own

237
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,539
single-use utility coin that's specific

238
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,799
to say cannabis right we have pot coin

239
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:30,379
and there's a couple other projects out

240
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:35,219
there I don't want to mention but

241
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:37,379
essentially what we've done is we were

242
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,050
really tackling it from the omni-channel

243
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,820
aspect right so we realized that the

244
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:44,909
cannabis industry is extremely

245
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,170
vertically integrated so the b2c is one

246
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:50,549
of the aspects that we're tackling it

247
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:52,169
from so what we've done is from the the

248
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:54,629
consumer perspective we want to make it

249
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:56,099
as seamless as possible blockchain

250
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:58,110
digital currency it's confusing it's

251
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,259
complex probably scares most individuals

252
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,960
that are not in this room maybe some of

253
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:06,360
them that are and so what our whole goal

254
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,950
is to basically kind of humanize digital

255
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,769
currency right and so what we've done is

256
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:16,020
we've essentially created a simple way

257
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:18,299
for consumers that mimics traditional

258
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:21,090
financial institution or services but

259
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,259
yet has all the benefits being able to

260
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,700
leverage all the benefits of blockchain

261
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:25,889
technology and cryptocurrency in the

262
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,520
background so when consumers from the

263
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:30,960
b2c side interact with our application

264
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,429
you know there's very little difference

265
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,370
between what they're doing now with

266
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:37,019
PayPal and what they're doing with us

267
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:39,629
additionally you know we're also rolled

268
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,949
out the b2b side of it as well we would

269
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,480
complete the first integration with can

270
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,540
trade it's our first b2b wholesale

271
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,080
marketplace they connect the

272
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:49,799
dispensaries of the vendors and

273
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,450
suppliers so we wanted it from the

274
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,129
consumer adoption perspective we didn't

275
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,350
want to just tackle the issue from one

276
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:57,990
from one angle we wanted to be able to

277
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,269
approach it from all angles even moving

278
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,980
to you know how do we get rid of you

279
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:03,539
know the the remaining amount of cash

280
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,460
that's in the industry you know from

281
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,709
those that won't adopt you know

282
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,870
technology and whatnot we've actually

283
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,360
we're actually even rolling out our self

284
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,860
checkout key us slash ATM so those that

285
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,930
you know or I don't know what digital

286
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,399
currency who's all 36 I just want to pay

287
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:18,959
in cash and I want to get my project and

288
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,309
get out so they can pick out their

289
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,560
product they can go over they can put

290
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:24,739
their cash in and they're out

291
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:26,359
so I think by you know really taking an

292
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,339
omni-channel approach to this I think

293
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,800
we're really able to not only achieve

294
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:32,629
mass consumer adoption but really kind

295
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,609
of get a grasp on this problem in the

296
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,920
cannabis industry as far as cash is

297
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,990
concerned Thank You Adam so happy that

298
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,409
you're here as well looking you know

299
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,089
future forward and thinking about

300
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,198
solutions that are not involving banking

301
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,300
or payment because that's I think where

302
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:49,039
a lot of the focus has been placed on

303
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:51,889
where there's potential solutions using

304
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,688
this technology you know with with ages

305
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:56,299
you guys are doing product development

306
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:58,578
you're doing research you're trying to

307
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,620
formulate products to help individuals

308
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:02,438
that are otherwise using opioids etc so

309
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,558
I think we can all get behind the cause

310
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:09,349
I'm curious to hear more about how you

311
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:11,240
foresee blockchain being a tool that

312
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,879
you're able to leverage to help in that

313
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,870
endeavor sure absolutely

314
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:23,089
so this builds a bit on my academic

315
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:25,519
experience and doing cancer research in

316
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:27,680
that environment we have of course the

317
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,100
NCI the National Institutes of Health

318
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:34,068
the National Cancer Institute as well as

319
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:37,040
the Big Pharma system and all of these

320
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:39,349
central organizations are what have

321
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,929
created these really amazing data

322
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,360
repositories that have sped up so much

323
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:47,120
molecular biology research the human

324
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,159
genome there's protein atlases where you

325
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,799
can look at what does it what's

326
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:54,620
expressed in any particular cell type in

327
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:57,229
my body and these are tools that when

328
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,600
scientists and researchers go to ask the

329
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,399
next question you go to these databases

330
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,720
first you don't want to reinvent the

331
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:07,519
wheel you want to look for something

332
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,550
next and ultimately in d convoluting

333
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,769
this multitude of chemistry of chemical

334
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:16,188
compounds that you have in cannabis with

335
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:18,110
what's hits any particular cell or set

336
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:20,509
of receptors and a given tissue in a

337
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:25,999
given disease state that's a hugely

338
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:27,470
complex problem and unless we go back 30

339
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:29,629
years and start doing hugely

340
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,939
reductionist science science of doing

341
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:34,499
these compounds one by one we're gonna

342
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:37,048
wanna use large data sets and some AI if

343
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:39,479
roaches and ultimately d convolute what

344
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:41,369
are the most effective compounds now

345
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:43,199
getting back to the database problem in

346
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:45,719
cannabis of course due to the

347
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,519
regulations and laws we don't have any

348
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:49,319
of these central of repositories built

349
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,198
we don't have the National Institute for

350
00:13:49,318 --> 00:13:55,798
cannabis research but what we do have is

351
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:57,748
people like that are in this room that

352
00:13:55,798 --> 00:14:00,629
have all of their own endeavors going on

353
00:13:57,749 --> 00:14:02,579
they're all producing exactly this kind

354
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:04,558
of data that we need and really it's the

355
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:07,558
same kind of data you would get out of a

356
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:09,749
multitude of research labs what we need

357
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:11,818
to be able to do is integrate that data

358
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:13,918
in a way that you can not only analyze

359
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:16,889
all of the data but ask really your

360
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:19,019
important question of how does my sample

361
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:21,058
how does my chemistry compare to what's

362
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:23,249
going on so that you can establish your

363
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:26,129
unique niche in the market and target

364
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:28,528
the right customers and I think the

365
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:30,839
blockchain is uniquely fit for this

366
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:33,418
cannabis approach in that the industry

367
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,779
really prizes their independence as has

368
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:39,568
already come up and people I don't think

369
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:41,548
are even looking for one corporation or

370
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:44,278
one national agency to put this together

371
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:46,068
for them they want results now and the

372
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,808
blockchain is going to be a great way to

373
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:51,478
contribute data where everyone knows

374
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:54,389
that they're contributing validated data

375
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:56,369
as things were the big problems in data

376
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:58,829
integration and analysis is data

377
00:14:56,369 --> 00:15:00,538
formatting and getting different kinds

378
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:02,728
of data sets integrated for further

379
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:05,338
analysis and these are all things which

380
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:07,349
can happen with community building in a

381
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,899
way that doesn't have a centralized

382
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:11,699
structure trust structure through the

383
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,220
blockchain approach the lack of

384
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:16,708
essential moral authority as a whole top

385
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,970
that we can get on to you as well I'm

386
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,469
gonna stick to the script for the time

387
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,788
being that's always that's that's that's

388
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:26,089
a fun one to talk about in the cannabis

389
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:30,109
space historically in technology there's

390
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:32,309
a difficulty in getting adoption for

391
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:34,109
what I'll refer to as black box

392
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:35,458
technologies so it's kind of something

393
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:37,559
where you give it an input something

394
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,788
happens that you don't know and then the

395
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:40,019
output comes out and you trust it and

396
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:42,629
move forward it's something that

397
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,509
consumers have a hard time with it takes

398
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:47,670
a lot longer for people to adopt those

399
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:51,000
sorts of technologies so

400
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:54,439
I'm curious how what do we have to do

401
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,580
how can we get the consumer to trust

402
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,550
blockchain technology you know whether

403
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:03,530
it's for a crypto perspective or or else

404
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:06,419
otherwise I'll start with Ken you know

405
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:10,019
how have you seen you know the adoption

406
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:11,399
of the - solution in on among the

407
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,169
consumers right looks like what sort of

408
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,949
education have you had to provide in

409
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:18,740
order to provide comfort to people in

410
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,060
order from nationally interactive system

411
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,039
absolutely I face this every day I think

412
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:25,500
it was on a call about three hours ago

413
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,870
where I had to kind of argue my way out

414
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,690
of this and so from a consumer adoption

415
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,399
perspective right every most people like

416
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,590
what they real what they know is that

417
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,829
the word blockchain right other than

418
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,330
that they know the benefits of it maybe

419
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,940
the four or five benefits of it right

420
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:45,300
but for anybody that's ever used digital

421
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,500
currency it's it's extremely like I just

422
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:48,779
mentioned this before it's human

423
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,389
confusing and how do you even obtain

424
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:53,459
digital currency right if I tell you

425
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:56,340
guys right now that - is at nine dollars

426
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,560
a coin and tomorrow it's gonna be at 300

427
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,590
I mean you guys would probably be able

428
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,000
to do it but they might not be able to

429
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:05,069
how would you go acquire - coins right

430
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,259
and so there's a lot of aspects that are

431
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:09,509
hindering the consumer adoption of not

432
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,920
just only - digital currency but of

433
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:13,769
digital currency and general blockchain

434
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,660
projects in general for the purpose of

435
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:18,809
this I'm just going to talk about

436
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:20,370
transactional purposes um and so the one

437
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:22,200
thing that like I had mentioned before

438
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,699
that we've done is we you know our whole

439
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,710
goal is to simplify the process right

440
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,970
everybody's so familiar with traditional

441
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:29,009
financial sir can you trust them right

442
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:33,329
you trust PayPal you trust right trust

443
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:35,190
Square but when they first came out why

444
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:38,039
did you initially decide to you know

445
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,900
enroll with those services right because

446
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:43,440
of the hope and value that it provided

447
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:46,320
and you know one thing that most you

448
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,299
know dispensary operators talk to big

449
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,980
things right what are the - price

450
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,450
volatility of the currency and consumer

451
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,009
adoption those are the number - those

452
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,009
are the top two things that everybody

453
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:58,230
has concerns with right so when we take

454
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:00,269
a look at consumer adoption you have to

455
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,120
provide incentive to the consumer to

456
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:04,089
change the

457
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,579
behaviors right think about Apple pay I

458
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:08,919
use this as a example all the time

459
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:12,399
I've Apple pay on every I have Apple

460
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:15,190
paid draped on me all day long I've used

461
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,650
it never there's no incentive for me to

462
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,180
use other than convenience right but

463
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,950
it's not convenient for me to actually

464
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:25,420
go and change behavior that I've that

465
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:27,490
I've known for 20 30 years now no so but

466
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,930
if the Apple pay if Apple said listen on

467
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,630
every one of your purchases we'll give

468
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,820
you 1% back or they had a loyalty

469
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,860
program that incentivized me to you know

470
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:38,319
get rewards for and you know that I

471
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:40,058
could use towards travel or other other

472
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,789
things right they don't so what we've

473
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:45,579
done is we sat down with the - Network

474
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,839
and we we explain to them that consumers

475
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:49,928
are not going to adopt a process unless

476
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:52,329
they feel like there's a benefit and in

477
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,890
actually adopting it so what we've done

478
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:56,099
is we're incentivizing the consumer in

479
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,450
multiple ways for adopting our

480
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:01,349
registering and opting our platform as a

481
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:05,470
preferred method of paying for cannabis

482
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:07,119
so in incentives exist from $25 off the

483
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,220
first purchase just for you know

484
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,899
registering in our platform to you know

485
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,670
double loyalty rewards points with the

486
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,980
loyalty platforms that we've worked that

487
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,830
were integrated with and I think that's

488
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,630
the that's the biggest thing and that

489
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:21,069
combined with not scaring with all the

490
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,610
aspects of digital currency and

491
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:26,950
blockchain hash algorithms like Bitcoin

492
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:30,428
prices - how many digits that all freaks

493
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:33,090
me out so try to keep it as simple as

494
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:36,130
possible and not freak anybody out

495
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:38,259
probably good move mark I think you're

496
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,970
another in a slightly different position

497
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:42,720
with the services that you guys are

498
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,850
providing you're focused largely on b2b

499
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,819
it's a smaller audience that you have to

500
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:51,159
convince to use your technology but that

501
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:53,500
being said I'm sure you have had plenty

502
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,410
of pushback on the fact that you're

503
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,670
using blockchain

504
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,290
what is the pushback what does that look

505
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,660
like and you know what are the

506
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:03,609
detractors saying our potential issues

507
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,140
with technology we decided to go a

508
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:07,689
different route from a technology

509
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,520
standpoint utilizing blockchain so we

510
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,480
offer traditional banking services first

511
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,889
and the blockchain is utilized to

512
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,259
capture known source of funds from the P

513
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,700
os systems the know your client data

514
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:22,509
when you do background checks we sign

515
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,789
people up so from a currency side that's

516
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:26,769
not how we utilize our blockchain we

517
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:27,970
utilize it simply as utility token to

518
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:30,339
move data from one place to another

519
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:33,069
since we are a traditional banking

520
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:35,649
system nationwide we can bank THC in any

521
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:38,289
state legal and CBD in every state I'm

522
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,240
convincing a business owner to open up a

523
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:41,799
bank account a traditional bank account

524
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,039
that they don't have access to today and

525
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,569
that's really our biggest standpoint on

526
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,099
this and then blockchain gets utilized

527
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:50,259
it's just part of our compliance week

528
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:52,029
just like MS sequel does or Oracle

529
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:53,500
databases it's just something that gets

530
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:55,690
utilized in the background in order to

531
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,089
enable those transactions so when we do

532
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,710
get OCC audits or state audits from a

533
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:01,209
banking perspective we can meet those

534
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,769
compliance and we can ensure that no

535
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,470
three-letter agencies come at anybody's

536
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:07,119
door so really we solve that problem

537
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,480
just by being a traditional banking

538
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,829
resource to allow customers to do

539
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,440
traditional wires when they need to send

540
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:16,119
out to the to make payments from a you

541
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,740
know a utility perspective or their

542
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,569
landlords but if they handle any

543
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,799
cannabis related business it has to

544
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,329
utilize within our blockchain

545
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,950
perspective so we can capture the known

546
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:25,839
source of funds so when the receiver

547
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,190
gets that money and if they get audited

548
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,329
they're gonna know exactly where that

549
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,160
money came from and who did the

550
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:32,289
transaction and what it was for so we

551
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,610
capture all that data so really it's a

552
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,889
it's a slightly different model but

553
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:37,839
traditional banking is really what we

554
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,540
have to offer and that's that's that's

555
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,369
how we can take blockchain and apply

556
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:44,589
that to this industry and not just this

557
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:47,739
one but every other one to do faster

558
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:49,480
transactions we can do it cheaper and

559
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,349
more efficient than you're gonna do in

560
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,870
any other thing you know you guys

561
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:54,609
probably wired money before right man

562
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:56,649
what a pain in the ass that is plus it's

563
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:58,149
expensive what if I could tell you I can

564
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,610
put a million dollars in Ken's account

565
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,500
right now in two seconds does that

566
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:06,509
appeal to you what's a blockchain does

567
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,509
and we can do that in a compliant way

568
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,069
one dollar transaction fee yeah

569
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:14,379
transaction fees one dollar yeah I have

570
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:16,230
to charge something if you want me to

571
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:20,590
charge more well if you don't mind

572
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:23,079
nobody okay no takers okay Adam I'm

573
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,819
curious to hear about by the way that's

574
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:27,929
on any amount so you it's one dollar to

575
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:27,929
move 100 million dollars

576
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:34,909
again moving away from the finance guys

577
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:38,600
sorry for a second Adam I want to talk

578
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:41,960
more about the scientific community you

579
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:44,689
know are there concerns amongst your

580
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,940
peers about a blockchain based tracking

581
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,590
system you know if there are you know

582
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,840
what are people worried about I would

583
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:53,089
say it's just the opposite I would say

584
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:57,199
the approach overall is more similar to

585
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:59,119
Marx and that really the blockchain is

586
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,400
kind of built into the backend and it's

587
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,279
really not the users concern was their

588
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,370
concern as it gets the job done and the

589
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:11,450
main concern when people are discussing

590
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:13,849
how to use this data is how do I know

591
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,890
that I get the value for my data how do

592
00:23:13,849 --> 00:23:18,259
I know I'm not disclosing anything I

593
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,690
don't want to and really these are

594
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:23,299
exactly the kind of of answers that the

595
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,279
blockchain can provide in that it is a

596
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:27,619
way to lock down your data it is a way

597
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,049
to track what happens to it when it gets

598
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:33,129
transferred afterwards and I think a lot

599
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:36,319
of both the security and the potential

600
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,660
data security that comes along with some

601
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,470
blockchain applications are more of a

602
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,580
solution

603
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:45,860
to data handlers than a problem right

604
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:48,079
and I think with a lot of especially in

605
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:49,639
this industry as well bringing it back

606
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:53,750
to how this relates to cannabis with the

607
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:55,040
breaches in data breaches and security

608
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,289
systems going down I think that's

609
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,250
something that probably a lot of people

610
00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:02,509
can that's a problem a lot people can

611
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,859
relate to I want to not quite pivot but

612
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:05,390
I want to focus on something that I

613
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:08,809
think is really to me one of the more

614
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:11,350
interesting aspects of blockchain

615
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:13,759
technology and that's smart contracts

616
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:15,559
for those for those here who don't know

617
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,879
what a smart contract is it's basically

618
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:21,470
a scripted contract that all the

619
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,320
criteria for completion are scripted

620
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:27,680
into the contract before it takes place

621
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:30,679
the contract automatically executes upon

622
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,120
the fulfilment of all set criteria so to

623
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,230
think about at a high level it's it's

624
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,689
like when you stand in front of a

625
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,890
vending machine there's a smart contract

626
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,600
between you and the machine that if you

627
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,450
give it 2 bucks and 50 Cent's and push a

628
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,859
button you're gonna get a coke right

629
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,710
that's a very high-level example of what

630
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:48,639
a smart contract looks like I'm really

631
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:50,769
curious to hear what the implications of

632
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,590
smart contracts are for each one of you

633
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:55,569
and your businesses you know how do you

634
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:58,679
all think that smart contracts are going

635
00:24:55,569 --> 00:25:01,809
to impact the business world at large

636
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,890
but also you know specifically around

637
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:04,539
what you guys are doing and what are

638
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,540
some potential shortcomings there well

639
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:09,069
we use smart contracts for is if

640
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:10,809
traditional escrow services somebody you

641
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:12,970
might about a house or some other

642
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:14,950
transaction where you needed to parties

643
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,299
had to agree and provide certain things

644
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,400
in order for a transaction to get

645
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:19,899
completed so we can use smart contract

646
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,790
from that so we provide full escrow

647
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,800
services for all our clients that are in

648
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:26,920
our banking platform right so I want to

649
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:28,690
buy thousand kilos of ice lid or I want

650
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,789
to move you know ten million dollars

651
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,259
from one transaction or another we can

652
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:33,879
actually put that in a smart contract

653
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:35,349
act as an escrow service for you and

654
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,360
again we can do it almost for nothing

655
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:39,129
that means the cost electricity at that

656
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,990
point and that's one of the most

657
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,820
appealing things for us to do so instead

658
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,349
of costly you know you might use safe

659
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:46,029
funds or something like that to do a lot

660
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:47,799
of your larger transactions you don't

661
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:49,690
need to do that when you have smart

662
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:51,099
contracts and we can we can already

663
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,720
captured your data because you're on our

664
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:54,699
banking platform so we know who you are

665
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,079
we know your known source of funds and

666
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,569
now all you got to do is give us a

667
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,009
criteria for your transaction is it I

668
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:00,669
had a license bonded warehouse did it

669
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:02,680
get delivered

670
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,930
what are those expectations we put that

671
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,640
in once those are met transactions

672
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,380
completed and then it's done so that's

673
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,910
smart contract for us and I think it's

674
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:15,370
really amazing it's gonna revolutionize

675
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:18,519
how cost the transactions happen I can

676
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:20,919
absolutely see applications at the

677
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,710
higher level once we have a lot of data

678
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,779
pooled together where there are some

679
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,900
type of incentives for doing analysis

680
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:30,819
for for working on the data but what I'm

681
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:35,140
really excited about the smart contracts

682
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:36,819
is for data collection there's so much

683
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,870
we're in this really unique position

684
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:42,639
with cannabis right now where because of

685
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:44,889
not only the medical recommendation

686
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,770
system but especially legality we

687
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,230
basically have an uncontrolled clinical

688
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:52,980
trial going on at all times with

689
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:55,839
millions of people people are treating

690
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,750
specific elements with their favorite

691
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:01,808
products and this data is hugely

692
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:04,298
valuable as a whole for for medical

693
00:27:01,808 --> 00:27:06,519
analysis and and everyone knows that so

694
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:09,519
I like the idea of if people are willing

695
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:12,190
to give us more data longitudinal data

696
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,710
more personal data we can use a smart

697
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,890
contract system to pay them for this

698
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:19,990
data and then pay them again once a that

699
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,740
data is in a pool that's used by a

700
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:25,720
company for analysis it it's I think

701
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,480
using these methods we can incentivize

702
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:32,950
people to not only give us data but

703
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:36,730
really give us kind of a live look at

704
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:39,279
what's happening with them on the level

705
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:41,319
of every other little Internet of Things

706
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,200
device and Apple watch that is coming

707
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:46,569
out and yeah I think I think as a whole

708
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:51,548
that would be we need to collect this

709
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:53,439
this data before it's gone I think smart

710
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:54,819
contracts are awesome

711
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,298
you think about how many inefficiencies

712
00:27:54,819 --> 00:28:00,279
are within every one of our experiences

713
00:27:58,298 --> 00:28:02,500
in life right you ever go you have a

714
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:06,279
broker involved in any process that you

715
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,798
do mortgages buying your car Minh

716
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:10,389
efficient I mean what are they doing

717
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:12,129
that's in your best interest right what

718
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,200
is a broker doing is everything that's

719
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:17,169
in his best interest rate and it's not

720
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:21,429
necessarily an efficient fair

721
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:23,500
transaction right but from a smart

722
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:25,269
contract perspective I think that you

723
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,740
know within the cannabis industry given

724
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:28,150
that it is so vertically integrated

725
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,599
let's use California for an example

726
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,590
right

727
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:34,149
I think smart contracts combined with

728
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:35,859
and this is cool what you can do with

729
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,450
different blockchain projects is you can

730
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:38,589
have every blockchain project as you

731
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,900
guys probably know has a different

732
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:43,720
purpose right there iam smart contracts

733
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:46,630
- transactional so by combining two of

734
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,630
the projects you know in incorporating a

735
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:52,809
transactional blockchain project within

736
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:54,940
a say a smart contract project as the

737
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:55,869
supply chain moves throughout as the

738
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,370
product moves throughout the supply

739
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:59,500
chain everybody knows right how many

740
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:02,079
points is it in 15 points right now in

741
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,059
California something around there but

742
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,730
that we can enable

743
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:07,659
so that as the supply moves through the

744
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:11,019
product moves throughout the supply

745
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:13,870
chain the individual will get paid in

746
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:17,559
real time I think that's probably one of

747
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:20,319
the most beneficial uses to and removing

748
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,720
the the whole aspect of brokerage again

749
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:26,619
coupling it on escrow because that's

750
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,740
probably one of the most utilized

751
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:31,569
resources for smart contracts great

752
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:34,150
awesome thanks another thing that I've

753
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:37,179
been doing a little research on lately

754
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:41,530
and and strikes me as really intriguing

755
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:43,000
is blockchain as a tool for Identity

756
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:46,359
Management I think we've probably all

757
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,009
heard some story about crypto

758
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:50,049
millionaire who lost all their money

759
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:52,299
because they left a USB Drive with their

760
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:54,490
private key in their pants that they

761
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:56,109
lost right that sort of thing right so

762
00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:00,220
Identity Management is a real

763
00:29:56,109 --> 00:30:06,579
significant issue when it comes to to

764
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:07,960
blockchain is there I mean along with

765
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:12,009
this as well I've been reading a lot

766
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:14,140
about the refugees that so many refugee

767
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:16,150
problems around the world and how they

768
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,100
are having problems with identity as

769
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,200
well not so much from a financial point

770
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:21,490
of view but more so of you know these

771
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,549
are these are individuals we've had to

772
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:25,809
leave their home without their passports

773
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:27,069
they have no way to identify who they

774
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:28,809
are and basically that means that they

775
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:32,759
don't exist in a lot of ways and there's

776
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:35,679
no way for them to identify who they are

777
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:37,029
so the question I have and I guess you

778
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,560
guys need to take it in its own in your

779
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:40,210
own way

780
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,769
is is there a way to leverage a

781
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,630
distributed blockchain solution for

782
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:45,099
identity management that will help

783
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,130
alleviate some of the issues that we've

784
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:50,139
seen I think we already carry a few

785
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:52,690
things that fit Identity Management

786
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,070
which sees right here which enabled us

787
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,850
to work 24/7

788
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:59,799
unfortunately I'm sure most of us do

789
00:30:56,849 --> 00:31:02,679
really you're gonna see blockchain focus

790
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:04,539
on more of just like I said aggregating

791
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,430
data and information and being stored in

792
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:08,559
a central location might be a chip in

793
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,820
your neck or a chip in your phone but

794
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,589
it's gonna be somewhere that you store

795
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:13,419
with you right just like a poker chip

796
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:15,129
you you carry out on a poker chip that's

797
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,990
the value it's if I lose that just like

798
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,190
my ID or my credit cards or anything I'm

799
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,019
really upset about it

800
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,970
but I can't lose those things so if I

801
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:24,190
put that in the blockchain and being

802
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,500
able to use from an identity perspective

803
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,120
if I can scan my arm and all the sudden

804
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,369
the paramedics know that my blood type

805
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,959
and any other known sickness or illness

806
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:33,428
or whatever's wrong me that'd be pretty

807
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,350
cool and I'd do it something call Big

808
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:36,610
Brother but really that's the future

809
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:38,138
where we're gonna go and I think that

810
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:39,849
would be one of the best ways to solve a

811
00:31:38,138 --> 00:31:42,729
refugee problem cuz I could identify

812
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:44,168
myself and if somebody came across me

813
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,819
and they scan me they know where my

814
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:47,799
family could possibly be because then

815
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:49,269
maybe we have GPS locators on us again

816
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:51,460
we already do with Cameron on our phones

817
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:53,399
I think that'd be pretty cool to help

818
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:58,000
solve that

819
00:31:53,398 --> 00:32:01,028
yeah identity is identity is a really

820
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,638
big piece of the evolution of health

821
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:05,909
healthcare right now and I mean I'm sure

822
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:08,019
we most of us have had the situation

823
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:09,789
where you go from one doctor or another

824
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:11,319
or you go to see a specialist and

825
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:12,669
somehow all you do is walk down the

826
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:14,548
hallway in the same hospital and

827
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:16,899
suddenly your records aren't available

828
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:18,819
and it gets even worse if you're going

829
00:32:16,898 --> 00:32:21,729
between hospitals dealing with insurance

830
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:24,490
and blockchain based identity for health

831
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:27,339
health record tracking has been really a

832
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:29,169
pretty big you know application

833
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:32,980
discussion IBM's getting big into the

834
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:36,490
area and I think mmm really cannabis use

835
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,628
is just going to integrate with the rest

836
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,339
of your health care and how does

837
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:42,189
cannabis interact with the rest of your

838
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:44,859
drugs and it really just kind of

839
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:47,830
dovetails into I think the larger future

840
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:49,750
of having your medical records not only

841
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:52,778
shareable between hospitals but

842
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,638
accessible to yourself as well because

843
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:56,138
that's another thing that is really hard

844
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:58,599
to get done when you need a paper copy

845
00:32:56,138 --> 00:33:00,219
of something so I think that all rolls

846
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:04,658
together with some of the digital

847
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:06,278
healthcare and identity that's coming so

848
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:08,470
for me I didn't need management

849
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:11,319
perspective I will talk about kind of

850
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:13,470
like identity of you know specific

851
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:16,240
products because it can be tracked to

852
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,339
personal identities as well but when you

853
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,069
think about genome tracking right from

854
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:23,230
cannabis perspective you created og cush

855
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:24,519
how can you prove that you store that

856
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,950
information in the blockchain as a

857
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:29,649
sequential form of blocks that that are

858
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:32,110
built behind it that are immutable so

859
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:33,759
essentially if you're able to store that

860
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:36,369
data within the blockchain you're able

861
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:39,099
to identify the original creator of that

862
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:40,419
specific strain and be able to track it

863
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:41,379
back throughout all of history and

864
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,690
that's great thing about blockchain

865
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,870
technology is permanent until the end of

866
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:48,429
history and I think that's you know from

867
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:51,399
a cannabis perspective that's one of the

868
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:53,048
biggest things from an actual user

869
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,610
perspective I think why don't you know

870
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:56,230
one of the benefits of blockchain

871
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:57,819
technology is the fact that you know

872
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,470
when you make a transaction your

873
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:01,240
personal identity is not tied to that

874
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,620
transaction right the only thing that's

875
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,390
tied to that transaction is your wallet

876
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:07,479
address and that in the transaction

877
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,889
amount right so one thing that you know

878
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,719
I think from a compliance perspective

879
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:12,789
that the government is trying to you

880
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,378
know really try to figure out and this

881
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:16,239
is the topic of conversation and

882
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:17,739
blockchain is how is the federal

883
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,209
government gonna regulate this from a

884
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:21,819
compliance perspective right we talked

885
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:24,159
about AML KYC anti-money laundering know

886
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:26,019
your customer well when somebody makes a

887
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,858
transaction on the blockchain there is

888
00:34:26,019 --> 00:34:28,929
no identity

889
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:31,779
PII personal identifiable information

890
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:33,159
associated with that transaction so I

891
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,320
think you guys are all aware of what

892
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,519
happened in Silk Road right I you know

893
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,169
they're still going back and mining the

894
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:40,239
blockchain and pulling out records but

895
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:44,289
they still can't tie those individual I

896
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:46,750
mean Ross Albrecht poor guy

897
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:48,099
but anyway so they can't tie those

898
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,349
individual transactions what there's

899
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:53,799
ology dressers well addressed to an

900
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:55,960
actual human so I think from an identity

901
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,850
perspective you know the government and

902
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,470
and I guess where we and I'm not trying

903
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:05,170
to pitch our company but and also him

904
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:07,989
know pitching we were I'll pitch him we

905
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:10,480
do kind of similar things from a you

906
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:13,599
know an AML kyc perspective you know

907
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,240
we're able to verify and tie an actual

908
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,608
identity behind that transaction so that

909
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,469
way you know nefarious illicit

910
00:35:18,608 --> 00:35:22,569
transactions are being able to be

911
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:25,329
tracked and and stopped in real time

912
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:28,390
versus I mean what's been happening with

913
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:35,139
blockchain technology and people using

914
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:36,909
it to avoid all sorts of everything so

915
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:38,319
also I'm gonna open it up to questions

916
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:40,599
here in a little bit but I just want to

917
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,440
give these guys a last minute last

918
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:47,250
chance to kind of talk about what's next

919
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,889
so again a lot of people look at

920
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,619
blockchain as this blank canvas solution

921
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:55,139
to so many of the world's problems so I

922
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:56,489
guess last question I have for each of

923
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:59,009
you and we'll start with mark and work

924
00:35:56,489 --> 00:36:00,500
our way back up what else

925
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:05,370
what haven't we talked about tonight

926
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:07,019
that is an a valid application for

927
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:09,269
blockchain technology as a solution I

928
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:11,699
think we already touched on quite a bit

929
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:13,920
from a medical perspective a personal

930
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:16,289
perspective a financial perspective we

931
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,880
can tokenize anything I got people

932
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:19,769
coming to me right now I work with us

933
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,570
gold we're making tomorrow you're gonna

934
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:24,000
hear about a launch of a new gold token

935
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,850
it's coming out of Wyoming so watch out

936
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,139
for that didn't pitch though but so we

937
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:30,329
can tokenize anything if you have an

938
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:32,279
asset like energy which is a really big

939
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:34,590
one real estate just think of how we can

940
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,840
get away from again escrow services or

941
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,250
the reason for all the transactional

942
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,329
peace and unfortunately might put people

943
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,340
out of jobs but we'll figure something

944
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:43,440
out later but really what that's gonna

945
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:45,600
do is enable very quick transactions

946
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,460
again compliant to ensure everything's

947
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,989
wait it's supposed to be like title

948
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,429
companies there's no reason for a title

949
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:52,979
company it's really no reason for

950
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:54,690
brokers and you know mall brokers to but

951
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,070
there's no reason for that we can really

952
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:58,320
solve all those problems

953
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:01,680
utilizing blockchain it may sound corny

954
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,050
but it's but it's real and you guys

955
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,609
right here sitting in front of a lot of

956
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,190
people that are pioneers in this

957
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:10,200
industry and we're you know we've been

958
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,519
in this 15 minutes longer than you you

959
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,539
should get involved because it's really

960
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:17,670
gonna be something's gonna change your

961
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:20,489
life so the way my research career

962
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:23,400
evolved over the last decade or so I got

963
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:25,049
really involved in well it's a company

964
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,670
called science exchange and one of the

965
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:29,640
things they do is connect people that

966
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,470
need experiments to people that have the

967
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:33,480
equipment and expertise to do it and

968
00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:35,789
this kind of distributed science

969
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,670
approach has a lot of potential

970
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:40,829
it certainly is faster and cheaper than

971
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,150
spending two million dollars to set up

972
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:44,699
your own equipment and reinvent the

973
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,530
wheel in your own laboratory and the

974
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:48,538
other thing that comes into play is

975
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:51,630
there is

976
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:55,829
a glut of phd's in this country right

977
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:58,619
now 20 years ago the NIH system exploded

978
00:37:55,829 --> 00:38:00,269
and there are people that have been

979
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:02,249
sitting in the same lab working on the

980
00:38:00,268 --> 00:38:05,308
same thing for 20 years and these are

981
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:07,288
just talent and minds that are ready to

982
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:10,439
be put to work if they have some

983
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:14,130
incentive so I love the larger concept

984
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:16,048
of using the blockchain to issue some

985
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:19,318
type of Technol tech or science

986
00:38:16,048 --> 00:38:20,278
challenge here's the data tell me what

987
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:22,409
you can do with it

988
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:24,929
earn your reward like an X price

989
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:26,578
situation differ for data but in a

990
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:29,519
wrangling smaller and maybe smart

991
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:31,859
contracted because I really see people

992
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:35,008
that would love to work on this if they

993
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:36,568
had the data in hand and a little bit of

994
00:38:35,009 --> 00:38:38,668
incentive it wouldn't take much for

995
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:40,380
these academics and I really think

996
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:41,848
that's that's the way a lot of good

997
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,229
science is gonna get done in the future

998
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:48,989
great all right now I'll throw to one

999
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:50,428
from the cannabis industry one from not

1000
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:52,679
the cannabis industry so the cannabis

1001
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:54,838
industry I think a good applicational

1002
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,059
use would be cannabis futures

1003
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:58,558
I think that's an entire market that you

1004
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:00,539
know is there's a lot of players right

1005
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,309
now that are exploring it and they're

1006
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:04,380
starting to put together platforms and

1007
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:06,239
markets to try to tackle this but I

1008
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,949
think if we were to utilize blockchain

1009
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,289
for you know the cannabis futures market

1010
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:12,719
I think it'd be a significant thing non

1011
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:14,099
cannabis we've been you know we partner

1012
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,900
with the - Network probably about a year

1013
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:17,579
and a half go we've been working

1014
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,519
actually with the congressman Schweikert

1015
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:22,499
in Arizona I one thing that we've been

1016
00:39:20,518 --> 00:39:24,868
we've been talking about and I think it

1017
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:29,158
would be super beneficial to not only

1018
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:31,829
part time workers but you know so these

1019
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:33,298
micro transactions micro transactions

1020
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:34,380
are they cannot occur in a lot of

1021
00:39:33,298 --> 00:39:35,788
environments right every single

1022
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,459
transaction ESCO through our bank

1023
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:39,900
there's fees associated with it and the

1024
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:41,668
it's not worth actually processing the

1025
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,199
transaction but much removed drivers or

1026
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:45,118
lyft drivers and so forth these

1027
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,159
part-time employees that don't

1028
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,380
necessarily get retirement benefits and

1029
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,539
so what we've been working on is being

1030
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,219
able to provide micro transactions for

1031
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:55,380
these large organizations so that way

1032
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:58,108
they can provide incentives to these

1033
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:59,789
part-time workers that may not be you

1034
00:39:58,108 --> 00:40:02,000
know privy to getting you know I'm not a

1035
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:04,220
full time employee I can't get

1036
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,559
but being able to at least provide them

1037
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:08,209
the fractional amount that they should

1038
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:11,179
be getting based off the work that

1039
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:14,570
they're doing so there's a lot of cool

1040
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:16,730
things you can do with it it's just the

1041
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:19,850
tool right it's a tool I think that's

1042
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:22,250
what you know one thing that if there's

1043
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:23,630
one takeaway for me from everything I've

1044
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,360
learned about blockchain is that it is a

1045
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:28,400
tool a lot of people want to give it

1046
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,470
magical sort of attributes and and and

1047
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,700
paint it as the solution to all the

1048
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,649
world's problems but at the end of the

1049
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:35,419
day it's it's a tool no different than

1050
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,610
Oracle was a tool it's a tool no

1051
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,840
different than jQuery was a tool it's a

1052
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:41,510
tool so really interesting seeing what

1053
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,670
everyone does with it now you guys have

1054
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:46,100
been sitting so patiently and quietly I

1055
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,539
want to thank you guys for that covered

1056
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:50,119
a lot of different things jumped all

1057
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:51,529
over the map on this curious if anyone

1058
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:54,139
has any questions for anybody up here

1059
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:56,900
the main topic here is is around

1060
00:40:54,139 --> 00:41:00,230
volatility concerns that people have

1061
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:02,570
around cryptocurrency right and so I

1062
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:04,340
don't know how many people know how how

1063
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,890
a transaction and cryptocurrency works

1064
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:08,090
but basically you take fiat currency

1065
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:09,889
dollars Canadian dollars whatever have

1066
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,990
you euros you transfer it into a

1067
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:15,349
cryptocurrency you then use that

1068
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:16,519
currency to transport that value from

1069
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:18,409
one individual to another

1070
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:19,699
at which point if the individual wants

1071
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,440
to be able to use that currency for

1072
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:24,889
anything I'll still have to transfer

1073
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,780
that back into fiat currency so the

1074
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:29,480
question I think specifically is around

1075
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,970
that volatility so if the market is very

1076
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,829
volatile if the transaction takes a long

1077
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:37,489
period of time there's a potential for

1078
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:39,230
the asset to be worth less when

1079
00:41:37,489 --> 00:41:41,179
converting it back into fiat currency

1080
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,130
than it was when it first was converted

1081
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:45,139
in so I think the question is how are

1082
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,090
you accounting for that and what are the

1083
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:48,799
solutions that you provide absolutely so

1084
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,390
like I said earlier that's one of the

1085
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,060
one of the two major concerns for

1086
00:41:50,389 --> 00:41:55,250
dispensary operators so we were luckily

1087
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:58,009
lucky enough to partner with probably

1088
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,559
the top five blockchain projects in the

1089
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:03,020
world one of them being exchanged so

1090
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,969
what that does is allows us to provide

1091
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:07,250
the ability within our platform so when

1092
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:08,929
somebody pays in digital currency we can

1093
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,449
actually convert immediately back to US

1094
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:13,489
dollar without with the zero vault with

1095
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:15,259
zero exposure to the volatility the

1096
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,879
price and so

1097
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,770
at the beginning what we're doing is

1098
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,530
we've enabled our Auto conversion

1099
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:25,880
feature on all transactions because we

1100
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:27,980
feel that most people and forgive me I'm

1101
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,410
talking about those guys not you guys

1102
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,789
I'm just kidding but most people don't

1103
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:32,899
understand digital currency right they

1104
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:34,400
don't understand the markets they don't

1105
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,200
understand what volatility means they

1106
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,180
don't understand that you know over the

1107
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:40,309
course of eight hours that the price can

1108
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:42,440
you know drop significantly or it can

1109
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:44,210
increase significantly right so given

1110
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:48,650
the fact that most people's exposure to

1111
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:50,269
risk is very very low we we've enabled

1112
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,858
the auto conversion now as people what

1113
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:53,960
we feel as people get more comfortable

1114
00:42:51,858 --> 00:42:55,819
to accepting digital currency and the

1115
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,639
volatility price understanding how the

1116
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,650
markets work you know will allow them to

1117
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:01,849
control that actually we still do right

1118
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,858
off the bat we allow them to control

1119
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:05,809
that feature so say that say the price

1120
00:43:03,858 --> 00:43:07,969
of the digital currency is significantly

1121
00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:09,650
increasing that reak well I'm not gonna

1122
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:11,529
Auto convert immediately we give them

1123
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:14,420
the option to create strategies around

1124
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:15,769
increasing the the valuation of the

1125
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,440
money or the funds that they're in

1126
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:21,019
taking so you know say for a week

1127
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,849
- currency is significantly increasing

1128
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:25,070
well I would encourage them so they

1129
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:27,199
accept you know they accept money from

1130
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:29,210
the consumers at a certain price over by

1131
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,368
the end of the day they've increased the

1132
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:33,619
price of that by you know a certain

1133
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:35,119
percentage maybe they batch out at the

1134
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:36,829
end of the night so we give them options

1135
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,210
that maybe you know do nightly bashing

1136
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:40,579
hourly batching whatever they feel like

1137
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,690
doing but we want to be able to give

1138
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:43,969
them the control as they feel

1139
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:47,269
comfortable as as their threshold of

1140
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:49,489
risk so how is that any different than

1141
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:53,059
using a banking solution correct like

1142
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:56,589
how does that the question is with this

1143
00:43:53,059 --> 00:44:00,409
digital currency system being merely for

1144
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:01,730
transferring the monetary value from one

1145
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:03,679
holder of fiat currency to another

1146
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,880
holder a fiat currency but at the end of

1147
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:06,829
the day they're still left with that

1148
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,410
fiat currency right like how can they

1149
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:10,460
then is there a banking solution or how

1150
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:11,690
can they work around the fact that

1151
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:14,990
there's not a banking solution for that

1152
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:16,639
fiat currency so so the the thing that

1153
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:19,579
we're running into it's not even it's

1154
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:22,039
not even a banking problem it's it's the

1155
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:23,690
ability to be to accept payments via

1156
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:25,639
Visa MasterCard the payment card

1157
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:28,300
networks right so from a banking

1158
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:30,759
perspective banks actually

1159
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,110
they love us because they're seeing

1160
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,550
those funds coming from the exchange of

1161
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:36,400
digital currency rather than from the

1162
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,420
proceeds of cannabis right given that

1163
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,700
we're you know we have money

1164
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,079
transmission licensing where money

1165
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:43,289
transmission business or service

1166
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:46,480
business through fencin fully registered

1167
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:47,320
you know they they actually they they

1168
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,869
don't have a problem with that

1169
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,690
whatsoever it's more or less getting the

1170
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:56,289
money from Visa MasterCard in the system

1171
00:44:52,690 --> 00:45:00,909
without actually going through you know

1172
00:44:56,289 --> 00:45:01,509
the actual rails so I they I don't see a

1173
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:07,960
problem with it

1174
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:10,780
do you at that point yeah it's it's very

1175
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:13,000
similar so like ken's product just just

1176
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,840
like ours is we start as a compliance

1177
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,849
company first

1178
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,740
so when Kent's taken in that money he

1179
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:20,289
knows there's no source of funds or I

1180
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:21,729
don't know where you're at but known

1181
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:24,309
source of funds is probably the biggest

1182
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:26,320
thing for banking and so like so we go

1183
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:28,389
through OCC audits and state audits and

1184
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,240
if we have that information then we can

1185
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:33,759
comply with FinCEN 2014 requirements and

1186
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:35,349
so so you've seen the cash problem so

1187
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,480
now that they have cash on hand how do

1188
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:39,969
they get it to the bank the the

1189
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:43,420
follow-on question was now that the

1190
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:46,839
banks have a known source of funds is

1191
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:48,329
that what will placate them in order to

1192
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:51,730
allow these individuals to then bank

1193
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:54,369
with their institutions so so the the

1194
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:56,320
topic that a lot of people they don't

1195
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:59,139
even like to mention it's like money

1196
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,420
laundering let's talking about money

1197
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:03,819
laundering there's money laundering is

1198
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,440
not a bad thing if you understand

1199
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,730
regulation and compliance there's two

1200
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,220
types of money I want to be on record

1201
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,780
doing saying that absolutely I do I'm

1202
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:13,389
gonna look at the camera and point at it

1203
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,400
because I believe in my compliance team

1204
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:17,559
there they're amazing I

1205
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,849
so there's illegal money laundering and

1206
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:21,940
there's legal money laundering illegal

1207
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:25,059
money laundering is basically you're

1208
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,980
trying to clean money without without

1209
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:29,349
tracing it or without reporting it right

1210
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,369
and then there's there's there's legal

1211
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:31,750
money laundering too where you're

1212
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:33,339
actually reporting that money that

1213
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,989
you're receiving and you're creating a

1214
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:37,120
traceable record of it back to the

1215
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:39,279
government as long as you're complying

1216
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,078
within FinCEN's BSA

1217
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,069
the Bank Secrecy Act all of their

1218
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:46,780
regulations which the amount of time and

1219
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:50,409
believe me costs that we've put into

1220
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,150
doing this I think that we're in full

1221
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:53,710
compliance of everything that the the

1222
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:56,740
federal government's asking for at this

1223
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:59,889
point so so how so how are you solving

1224
00:46:56,739 --> 00:47:02,649
the solution to the problem of tying an

1225
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:05,920
identity to a source of funds using your

1226
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:09,760
solution so from a so when so we provide

1227
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,519
that kyc layer as far as understanding

1228
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,859
who our clients are and where the money

1229
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:17,199
is coming from right we actually provide

1230
00:47:14,858 --> 00:47:18,818
that and it's actually built in just

1231
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,799
like his platform as well but we've

1232
00:47:18,818 --> 00:47:22,838
actually automated the entire kyc

1233
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,150
process within our within our platform

1234
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:26,469
so that way you know we're identifying

1235
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:28,559
where the money's come from how much it

1236
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:31,149
is reporting it to the necessary

1237
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:34,719
entities that way there's a lot I can't

1238
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:36,160
talk about but FinCEN you know SARS

1239
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:38,980
reporting all that good stuff

1240
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:41,129
yeah I'm not supposed to talk about it

1241
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,940
according my compliance officers but

1242
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,980
there's a lot of the stuff that's going

1243
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:48,130
on back in that we're doing that ensures

1244
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,809
the government that we're tracking all

1245
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,490
of the funds that are going through our

1246
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:54,009
system and we're actually tying an

1247
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:55,750
identity to those wallet addresses and

1248
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,650
at the same time if we want to take it

1249
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,809
one step further

1250
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:01,210
you know we've integrated compliance but

1251
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:02,380
our compliance aspect to where risk

1252
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:04,389
scoring so we actually every single

1253
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,039
wallet that hits our platform we hit

1254
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:07,568
every terrorist database we have every

1255
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:09,608
dark web database to ensure that that

1256
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:12,130
wallet address is has not been used to

1257
00:48:09,608 --> 00:48:15,608
for terrorist activities or you know

1258
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:18,068
illegal act dark what we we make sure

1259
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:20,818
that our environment is as compliant as

1260
00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:23,769
we can be given the pseudo anonymous

1261
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:25,568
anonymity of blockchain transactions I

1262
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:26,980
want to take the opportunity actually to

1263
00:48:25,568 --> 00:48:28,630
add a follow-on question because I think

1264
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,818
there's a distinction between your

1265
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,559
platforms that is very interesting you

1266
00:48:30,818 --> 00:48:34,838
you glanced over earlier Markin and that

1267
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:38,259
you guys use a utility coin right as

1268
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:41,769
opposed to a to what Canada's it's more

1269
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:44,109
of a traditional coin token can you give

1270
00:48:41,769 --> 00:48:46,599
a brief explanation of of the difference

1271
00:48:44,108 --> 00:48:49,150
in why it matters utility token compared

1272
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:51,720
to a transactional token is is we use

1273
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:53,099
ours to store data and value

1274
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:55,589
and move it from one place to another so

1275
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:56,849
if you deposit a dollar into your bank

1276
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:58,410
account I'll give you a digital

1277
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:00,000
representation of it so you can move it

1278
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:01,769
just as you do when you use we need two

1279
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,059
digital payments it's just again

1280
00:49:01,769 --> 00:49:05,579
happening in the background where you

1281
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:07,650
have a transaction that gets utilized so

1282
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:09,029
it's there's no volatility there's

1283
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,700
nothing to it the dollars in your bank

1284
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,869
account you can look at it at any time

1285
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:14,460
if we just use a digital representation

1286
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:17,670
to move that in a cheaper faster

1287
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,619
lower-cost way so utility tokens are

1288
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:22,050
going to be more of a norm we'll call it

1289
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:23,550
asset backed so that's really what's

1290
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:25,980
gonna happen just we talked about energy

1291
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:27,570
or gold or anything else as long as

1292
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:29,940
something has some type of asset that

1293
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:32,460
it's gonna it's gonna help utilize that

1294
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:35,460
as a utility to transmit information or

1295
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,349
data from one place to another got any

1296
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:43,710
more questions out there Oh got a bunch

1297
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:45,840
John so the question was I'm sorry so it

1298
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:46,769
was around the fact that and it's

1299
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,630
something that's a topic that I've

1300
00:49:46,769 --> 00:49:51,599
actually spoken about a lot like until

1301
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:55,079
the day comes when I can swipe my credit

1302
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:57,390
card and there is no difference in the

1303
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:59,338
process to me as the observer the

1304
00:49:57,389 --> 00:50:01,799
consumer of how that value gets

1305
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:05,429
transferred from my credit card to the

1306
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:07,440
proprietor of the dispensary how far

1307
00:50:05,429 --> 00:50:09,598
away are we from that day to when that

1308
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,230
can happen well again we'll get back to

1309
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,869
the banks ACH automated Clearing House

1310
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:17,429
vs. Visa MasterCard right so we're

1311
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:19,440
probably a ways away from Visa

1312
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:22,919
MasterCard being PR friendly with

1313
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,650
cannabis related companies but from the

1314
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,750
consumer perspective right that's really

1315
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:30,139
all we care about is a consumer picks

1316
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:32,880
out their product they pay for it using

1317
00:50:30,139 --> 00:50:34,679
the account the means that they have

1318
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,858
necessary to pay for that transaction

1319
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:39,779
with minimal friction involved so from

1320
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:43,650
the consumer perspective when you

1321
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:45,810
register within I'm not trying to

1322
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:47,070
promote our platform but essentially

1323
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,420
when the customer register simple

1324
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:51,150
process they link it to their checking

1325
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,800
account via the plaid plaid integration

1326
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,050
I actually incentivize them for doing

1327
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,980
that's a one-time behavior every single

1328
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,820
time they're going to the Spencer all

1329
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,639
they have to do is pick out their

1330
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:01,380
product verify the transaction via SMS

1331
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:03,129
text notification the dispensary has

1332
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:05,229
their funds in real time

1333
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:08,009
the customer has their product it's

1334
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:10,598
actually simpler than a PayPal

1335
00:51:08,009 --> 00:51:11,409
transaction but I will say and here's

1336
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:13,838
where I get to play devil's advocate

1337
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:14,798
that's not what we're looked at snot

1338
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:16,298
what he asked about what do you asked

1339
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:18,068
about when can I swipe my credit card

1340
00:51:16,298 --> 00:51:19,719
and everything is exactly the same as it

1341
00:51:18,068 --> 00:51:27,849
was before I was snap

1342
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:32,288
I don't know I'm not yep it's right now

1343
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:35,380
absolutely right now we launched about

1344
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:37,028
two weeks ago we we're we just got fully

1345
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,670
integrated our first b2b wholesale

1346
00:51:37,028 --> 00:51:40,539
marketplace our second partners almost

1347
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:43,269
completely through with their

1348
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:45,220
integration on the b2c platform we have

1349
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:46,808
about 15 other integration partners will

1350
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:51,449
be hitting the industry pretty pretty

1351
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:51,450
damn Marg so right you'll see you soon

1352
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:04,389
so the question is yeah are the BCR the

1353
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,009
banks cool with this yeah the banks love

1354
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:07,748
it because here's the thing right like

1355
00:52:06,009 --> 00:52:10,329
he was saying before what is the most

1356
00:52:07,748 --> 00:52:11,978
why are the banks not accepting cannabis

1357
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:13,809
related accounts right cannabis related

1358
00:52:11,978 --> 00:52:16,179
business because of all the compliance

1359
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:19,359
policies and procedures that go into you

1360
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:21,159
know know your customer czars filing on

1361
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:23,978
every single transaction it's costly

1362
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:25,989
they actually do not make money on

1363
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:27,669
cannabis related businesses so I mean

1364
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:28,900
when you when you sign up as say you do

1365
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,289
get a bank account look at the fees you

1366
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,318
have to pay

1367
00:52:29,289 --> 00:52:34,119
it's insane I think we just priced

1368
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:38,978
Windows 12,000 just to get a bank

1369
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:40,838
account but but the whole whole thing

1370
00:52:38,978 --> 00:52:43,718
about it is is that you know the banks

1371
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:45,548
from from you know our perspective they

1372
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:47,289
love what we do because we keep them

1373
00:52:45,548 --> 00:52:49,690
arm's length distance away from cannabis

1374
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:51,900
we actually provide and we refer I've

1375
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:54,099
all those let's call it compliance

1376
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:58,420
features that they would normally have

1377
00:52:54,099 --> 00:53:01,390
to do and in we send them great accounts

1378
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:03,099
and they love it so I mean from our

1379
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:06,728
perspective you know we have a portfolio

1380
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:08,559
of banks that we work with both domestic

1381
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:10,419
and international because you know we

1382
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:13,509
don't just operate in the US or a global

1383
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,920
company so work city works out pretty

1384
00:53:13,509 --> 00:53:16,119
well I guess we're gonna have to wait

1385
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,940
and see what the adoption looks like you

1386
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:20,838
guys should have a conversation

1387
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:23,300
it sounds like yeah we have some more

1388
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:32,119
any more questions one what this

1389
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:34,068
gentleman do we take on all the risk as

1390
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:36,858
long as we're abiding by FinCEN's

1391
00:53:34,068 --> 00:53:39,739
regulations we do not take the risk

1392
00:53:36,858 --> 00:53:41,568
so I mean what let's talk about what

1393
00:53:39,739 --> 00:53:53,479
risk are you are you talking about legal

1394
00:53:41,568 --> 00:53:56,568
risk or financial risk oh oh yeah

1395
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:58,010
snap yes absolutely yes yes and that and

1396
00:53:56,568 --> 00:54:00,050
that was kind of our whole the whole

1397
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:03,140
purpose in us implementing what and not

1398
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:06,260
just you know building out a kyc AML

1399
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:07,608
policy but actually building that into

1400
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,589
the technology and creating the software

1401
00:54:07,608 --> 00:54:11,179
protocols that automate the process so

1402
00:54:09,588 --> 00:54:13,429
that way we don't have to think about

1403
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:16,098
what we're doing and it just did we stay

1404
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:17,929
compliant while we sleep so it's kind of

1405
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:20,950
cool sounds great

1406
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:20,949
a lot of the questions we got

1407
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:39,568
we got one we got one

1408
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:59,809
so track and trace yes yeah and I think

1409
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:01,639
that's actually something that we didn't

1410
00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:03,259
touch on we actually did attempt to get

1411
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:05,659
some folks to join us to speak about

1412
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:07,030
tracking trace and you know we've I

1413
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:08,929
think those of us in the industry

1414
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:11,510
especially anyone involved the

1415
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:13,009
dispensary knows the nightmare of the

1416
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:14,750
current compliance landscape whether

1417
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:17,230
it's metric or any one of the other

1418
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:19,760
systems that everyone has to comply with

1419
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:21,170
whether it's outages or any other sort

1420
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,900
of situations that people have seen or

1421
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:24,950
just you know for lack of a better way

1422
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,410
of saying at a lack of sophistication

1423
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:28,549
amongst the systems right I think I

1424
00:55:27,409 --> 00:55:30,799
personally think there's a lot of

1425
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:32,390
opportunity for someone to step in and

1426
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,010
really disrupt so it's great to hear

1427
00:55:32,389 --> 00:55:36,199
that you know that someone is and I

1428
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:37,640
think you're probably not alone there's

1429
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,109
there's definite lot of other folks who

1430
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:41,690
are seeing blockchain because I mean

1431
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:44,030
it's kind of tailor-made for that right

1432
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:46,190
I mean it's it is a distributed ledger

1433
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:47,750
that allows you to track all these

1434
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:49,579
different transactions with no central

1435
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:51,829
moral authority to say we're gonna shut

1436
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:53,480
this down because X Y Z which is exactly

1437
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:55,219
what you want and because of the fact

1438
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,590
that it's distributed there's no central

1439
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:59,809
system that is required to be

1440
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:01,190
operational in order for for any of this

1441
00:55:59,809 --> 00:56:03,170
to work at any given time right it

1442
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:05,780
should just always work the question is

1443
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:07,309
who's gonna build the best in my mind

1444
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:09,890
the question is and I'm sorry I've been

1445
00:56:07,309 --> 00:56:12,619
waiting to talk so the question in my

1446
00:56:09,889 --> 00:56:14,719
mind is you know who's gonna build the

1447
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:16,489
appropriate system right again it comes

1448
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,559
back down to the to the point of this

1449
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:20,689
being a tool as opposed to a solution

1450
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,009
right so the blockchain is a tool who's

1451
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:23,840
gonna build the appropriate solution

1452
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:25,550
that has the best user interface that

1453
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,289
does the best integration with all the

1454
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:28,370
point-of-sale systems but does the best

1455
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:30,349
integration with all the cultivation

1456
00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:31,609
management systems right like who's

1457
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:34,429
gonna build it so that that actually

1458
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:35,630
happens quickly and efficiently and you

1459
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:37,309
know that's that's a question I don't

1460
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:38,750
have an answer to I don't know if if you

1461
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:41,119
guys want to add anything to this but

1462
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:42,500
it's it's something that's T be seen one

1463
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,779
thing that's another part of that big

1464
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:47,150
system I've been working on this is that

1465
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:49,070
at least testing laboratories and I

1466
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,630
believe manufacturers are required to

1467
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:52,700
keep their records for seven years in

1468
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:54,980
the state of California to comply with

1469
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:57,109
metric so it's just once again not the

1470
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:59,269
blockchain is the best solution but it's

1471
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:59,900
certainly another data storage is

1472
00:56:59,269 --> 00:57:03,358
another

1473
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:05,430
right and so ICS what we do is we

1474
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:09,449
integrate into all the known seed to

1475
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:11,489
sale systems and metric green

1476
00:57:09,449 --> 00:57:13,769
I'm sorry green bits we're in trees

1477
00:57:11,489 --> 00:57:15,599
we're an MJ freeway bio tracks or if

1478
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:16,889
you're using any of those systems we're

1479
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,420
already connected to the system so all I

1480
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:20,670
do is I take your ID and I can integrate

1481
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,289
that information and so so that that

1482
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,659
behavior doesn't have to change from a

1483
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:27,300
front-end and so I don't aggravate all

1484
00:57:24,659 --> 00:57:29,579
that data because we can't do that yet

1485
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:32,010
but again that would be really cool if

1486
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:34,170
if just one Authority was able to

1487
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:36,540
integrate into all those systems and and

1488
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:38,789
go do something awesome with it but yeah

1489
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:40,980
absolutely it's just hard to do they're

1490
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:44,009
there and those api's are available and

1491
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:46,530
that's that's what we do the questions

1492
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:50,460
to Adam about a statement he made

1493
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:52,320
earlier about wanting to track product

1494
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:55,980
efficacy amongst patients who have

1495
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,809
specific needs and the need to then

1496
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,150
compensate those patients for the data

1497
00:57:57,809 --> 00:58:02,820
in order for Adam to get the data he

1498
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:05,430
needs to be able to identify what's fact

1499
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:07,500
and what's myth about what strains work

1500
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:09,210
for what application so I think the

1501
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:11,880
question is how how are you incentivize

1502
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:13,470
the patients to do that right so the

1503
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,150
just sat on the last bit is how do you

1504
00:58:13,469 --> 00:58:17,639
make sure that that falls under HIPAA

1505
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:19,108
compliance and that all the boxes are

1506
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:23,039
being checked in order for it to be

1507
00:58:19,108 --> 00:58:25,199
legal right yeah there I think there's a

1508
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:27,358
couple of good reasons here the first

1509
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:29,639
one is the integration of the smart

1510
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:32,699
contracts for the micropayment sort of

1511
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:35,879
data we're not what we wanted to do is

1512
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:38,279
really reward people for reporting and

1513
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,869
tracking what they're using and how it's

1514
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,190
working and it's close to real-time as

1515
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:43,590
possible

1516
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:45,108
we know this data is going to be hugely

1517
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:47,039
messy these are self-reported

1518
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:49,969
observations on how did this

1519
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:53,699
particularly make me feel this time and

1520
00:58:49,969 --> 00:58:55,259
but that's okay a there's a lot of

1521
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:57,929
fields in science that are able to

1522
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:00,540
handle extremely messy data with the

1523
00:58:57,929 --> 00:59:04,259
proper computational tools and and data

1524
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:06,539
set so and not only that but the smart

1525
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:09,240
reward system I think allows us to tune

1526
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:12,880
in what kind of data is most valuable in

1527
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:16,059
order to get over the messy data process

1528
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:19,360
and really focus on what could be

1529
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:22,289
meaningful such as longitudinal data is

1530
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:24,940
something that's extremely difficult to

1531
00:59:22,289 --> 00:59:27,849
to collect in clinical research right

1532
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:30,550
now and that means those patients taking

1533
00:59:27,849 --> 00:59:32,559
a patient I'm sorry this patients taking

1534
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:34,750
a medication how does this work over

1535
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,519
time they may know in the first

1536
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:38,260
treatment but really if you have a

1537
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:40,719
chronic disease and cannabis is all

1538
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:43,930
often for a chronic disease kind of

1539
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:47,139
state your data of following up with

1540
00:59:43,929 --> 00:59:49,419
that single patient for a hundred data

1541
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:50,710
points is a lot more valuable than a

1542
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,630
hundred single data points from

1543
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:54,179
different people so I think the smart

1544
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:57,039
contracts are a way to incentivize

1545
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:59,679
really smart data collection number two

1546
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:02,230
is that there's not going to be I don't

1547
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,940
think one authority one corporation that

1548
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:06,159
takes over this data collection and just

1549
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:08,559
dominates the field it's gonna be a lot

1550
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:10,779
of different people doing these efforts

1551
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:14,110
in a way that most helps their business

1552
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:15,700
and their product now I think putting

1553
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:18,579
stuff on the blockchain with the kind of

1554
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:21,339
micro control you could have over who

1555
01:00:18,579 --> 01:00:23,440
gets to access what data people can pool

1556
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:25,600
their data and yet still have it

1557
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,730
scrubbed in a way which is traceable

1558
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,009
HIPAA compliant because there's clearly

1559
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:32,019
only certain data packets that are

1560
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:34,720
included in that particular particular

1561
01:00:32,019 --> 01:00:36,550
transaction so those those are the ways

1562
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:38,529
I think these micro transactions would

1563
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,970
help us aggregate the data into a size

1564
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:42,400
where we can find something meaningful

1565
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:44,469
and I just want to touch on one point

1566
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,230
that you brought up which is HIPAA

1567
01:00:44,469 --> 01:00:50,259
compliance right it's something that a

1568
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:52,300
lot of folks talk about when you use the

1569
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:55,210
word patients and medicine all of a

1570
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:57,190
sudden you fall into the category of of

1571
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:58,840
something that at some point should be

1572
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:01,210
HIPAA compliance but it's just really

1573
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,380
weird catch-22 right now because it's

1574
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:04,150
not federally legal and hip was a

1575
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:05,920
federal body right so there's not going

1576
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:09,160
to be a need for HIPAA compliance until

1577
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,260
that happens and once that happens then

1578
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:14,889
those well there's no patients

1579
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:17,440
absolutely yeah no I agree yeah they

1580
01:01:14,889 --> 01:01:20,259
absolutely deserve that right for for

1581
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,730
the HIPAA protections yeah but again

1582
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:24,830
even getting back to the federal

1583
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:27,199
regulations when somebody's using

1584
01:01:24,829 --> 01:01:30,259
considers themselves a recreational user

1585
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:32,179
oh but it helps me sleep now do they

1586
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:33,680
classify as a patient of course we

1587
01:01:32,179 --> 01:01:36,349
wanted to treat their data with the same

1588
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:39,619
consideration and security but this

1589
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:41,690
whole like right and I think that's

1590
01:01:39,619 --> 01:01:43,400
that's not a bad thing the other thing

1591
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:47,000
that's a great thing for cannabis if

1592
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,410
running you know it's true but when it

1593
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,699
gets down to the regulations the

1594
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:51,859
difference between running and

1595
01:01:49,699 --> 01:01:53,929
fda-approved clinical trial with a

1596
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:55,220
hundred thousand patients and collecting

1597
01:01:53,929 --> 01:01:58,190
this data on the ground the way we're

1598
01:01:55,219 --> 01:02:00,319
able to is I think where the opportunity

1599
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:02,420
is right I think that's you know that's

1600
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,610
a really good point to bring up is that

1601
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:07,010
with a lack of a federal legalization

1602
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:09,050
there's a lot of things that we can't do

1603
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:11,240
right so people are trying to figure out

1604
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:12,769
ways around that so we can do it legally

1605
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:14,839
and effectively I mean that's very same

1606
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:17,210
problem that you're talking about I've

1607
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:19,539
had brand customers of ours come to us

1608
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:22,309
and say hey we need to know how

1609
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:23,900
efficient our products are like people

1610
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:25,639
are coming into the store and buying

1611
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:27,139
product X because they think it's going

1612
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:29,179
to help them sleep they think it's going

1613
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:30,230
to help with their lack of appetite they

1614
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:32,779
think it's gonna help with their

1615
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:34,130
arthritis pain and we do the best that

1616
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:36,110
we can in order to give them a

1617
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:37,970
recommendation that should work for them

1618
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:39,380
but then they disappear into the ether

1619
01:02:37,969 --> 01:02:40,609
these people never come back and give

1620
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,980
you feedback about whether or not it

1621
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:45,019
worked and it's a huge problem that

1622
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:46,010
currently has no solution I mean people

1623
01:02:45,019 --> 01:02:46,940
are trying to fix it in many different

1624
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:49,070
ways I think this is a really

1625
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:50,539
interesting application yeah I think you

1626
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:51,950
know we're focused on the patients on

1627
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:53,960
the medical aspect but it would be

1628
01:02:51,949 --> 01:02:56,029
hugely informational and important to

1629
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:59,269
dispensaries and how about the growers

1630
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:00,860
growers don't get any credit for pride

1631
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:02,900
and good product right now you go to the

1632
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,519
dispensary you don't even know you know

1633
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,930
you're you're Green crack is gonna be

1634
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:07,250
the same thing next week it may come

1635
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:09,349
from somebody else under different

1636
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:11,269
conditions and so finding that thing

1637
01:03:09,349 --> 01:03:14,539
that works for you the track and trace

1638
01:03:11,269 --> 01:03:16,630
and and connecting you to the right

1639
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:19,909
medicine is really where it's at

1640
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:20,720
absolutely we have any more questions

1641
01:03:19,909 --> 01:03:21,739
out there I think we probably ought to

1642
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:23,389
start wrapping it up here pretty soon

1643
01:03:21,739 --> 01:03:23,929
I'm very proud of all of us for making

1644
01:03:23,389 --> 01:03:26,900
through an hour

1645
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:28,039
yes question guy number one so yes and

1646
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:30,050
this is actually really Justin question

1647
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:32,960
it comes up a lot right as the industry

1648
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:36,450
continues to grow you know talking about

1649
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:39,480
the origin of Green crack for example

1650
01:03:36,449 --> 01:03:40,559
how you know how can we be sure that as

1651
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,570
you know she grows the right people are

1652
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,219
getting credit that it's actually

1653
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:46,680
tracked and and and that we can identify

1654
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:50,338
that this is the actual formulation for

1655
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:53,338
green crack for you know whatever it

1656
01:03:50,338 --> 01:03:54,989
might be like how can how can blockchain

1657
01:03:53,338 --> 01:03:58,769
be leveraged in order to make sure that

1658
01:03:54,989 --> 01:04:01,769
that intellectual property is stored

1659
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:05,699
correctly and reviewable and easily

1660
01:04:01,769 --> 01:04:08,429
accessible it's a really interesting

1661
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:10,858
question for a couple of the reasons we

1662
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:13,440
already mentioned one is which you

1663
01:04:10,858 --> 01:04:15,088
really can't file patents you really

1664
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,760
can't go to the FDA because the federal

1665
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:19,139
regulations right now so I think it's a

1666
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,150
little bit of people trying to come up

1667
01:04:19,139 --> 01:04:23,250
with solutions that work and you see

1668
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:26,369
people doing things like sequencing the

1669
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:29,010
genome other of their plant hashing into

1670
01:04:26,369 --> 01:04:31,500
a blockchain for posterity and they're

1671
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:34,589
calling it proof of prior art a lot of

1672
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:38,429
times kind of a pre legal classification

1673
01:04:34,588 --> 01:04:42,389
for showing this publicly the other

1674
01:04:38,429 --> 01:04:46,169
problem or the other twist is that was

1675
01:04:42,389 --> 01:04:48,299
that 15-20 years ago the patent system

1676
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:51,809
cited that you cannot pant patent

1677
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:55,829
natural genes so if you discover a gene

1678
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:58,170
in nature if you discover a seed as I

1679
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:59,818
think this would fall under you're not

1680
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:02,369
allowed to patent that natural genome

1681
01:04:59,818 --> 01:05:05,880
sequence right now you can patent

1682
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:09,599
modifications to genome sequences which

1683
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:14,250
of course would say I'm gonna have GMO

1684
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:16,140
cannabis which freaks people up but it's

1685
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:18,690
could be really interesting to see even

1686
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:21,779
what is patentable versus trade parka

1687
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:24,088
Bowl you could say this is my green

1688
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:28,260
crack and now you've said I've got this

1689
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:29,730
chemical profile and there is a way you

1690
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:31,770
know when I'm doing I work in a lot of

1691
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:33,659
drug discovery research from natural

1692
01:05:31,769 --> 01:05:37,019
products actually and what you could

1693
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:39,449
patent was the application of a certain

1694
01:05:37,019 --> 01:05:42,210
compound even if it was natural so you

1695
01:05:39,449 --> 01:05:44,969
may be able to say well I can't patent

1696
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:47,699
the genome to my seed but I'm gonna find

1697
01:05:44,969 --> 01:05:50,250
out application patent for this exact

1698
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:54,569
ratio of THC CBD in these

1699
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:57,239
or terpenes for treatment of nausea and

1700
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:59,400
you patent a formulation and application

1701
01:05:57,239 --> 01:06:00,959
that is still going to be possible but

1702
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:03,300
of course then it comes back to can you

1703
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,679
replicate that in platform or now are

1704
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,930
you talking about some type of farm or

1705
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:09,449
product right and we're seeing that with

1706
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:10,710
epidemics right coming out now first I

1707
01:06:09,449 --> 01:06:14,219
don't know how many of you guys know

1708
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:16,199
about this first FDA approved cannabis

1709
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:18,599
based medicine for a very specific kind

1710
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:20,189
of epilepsy if I'm not mistaken so

1711
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:22,319
that's already starting now and you know

1712
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:24,630
there's and then there's you know we can

1713
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:26,580
have a long conversation about the

1714
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:27,780
predatory practices of pharma I'm sure

1715
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:28,769
everyone in the room was involved in

1716
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,390
cannabis has had plenty of those

1717
01:06:28,769 --> 01:06:32,159
conversations and you know they're

1718
01:06:30,389 --> 01:06:33,750
talking about this being you know a

1719
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,309
medication that costs upwards of

1720
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:36,719
something like $12,000 a month or

1721
01:06:35,309 --> 01:06:38,639
something like that for the patient so

1722
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:41,909
it's really pretty absurd what people

1723
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:45,480
are trying to get out of this status

1724
01:06:41,909 --> 01:06:47,029
right now thirty two thousand thirty two

1725
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:50,099
thousand a year that's where it is yeah

1726
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:51,510
nope there you go so yeah absolutely and

1727
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:53,250
that's actually really interesting and

1728
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:54,930
just to add something on to that because

1729
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,940
obviously you haven't heard enough for

1730
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:59,849
me yet tonight I what I think is really

1731
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:03,780
interesting you know for me as the tech

1732
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:06,210
and data guy for so long at Baker one of

1733
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:08,220
the big problems that we've I mean we

1734
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:13,289
still tackle is data normalization

1735
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:14,909
period right so we work with close to

1736
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:18,869
1200 dispensaries each one of those

1737
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:20,339
dispensaries has their own menu system

1738
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:22,289
now we might have gotten that menu

1739
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,730
system from their data they put up on

1740
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:26,219
Leafly or on weed naps or from their

1741
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:29,909
point of sale or from from any number of

1742
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:31,980
sources right there's no UPC code there

1743
01:07:29,909 --> 01:07:33,929
is no universal product code in the

1744
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:35,610
cannabis industry to indicate that this

1745
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:37,710
product is the same product that I

1746
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:38,940
bought you know six months ago or that

1747
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:41,579
even that this product is made by the

1748
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:44,579
same producer as this other product that

1749
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:47,219
I bought and it makes for a norm an

1750
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:49,380
enormous mess you know there's whole

1751
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:51,509
company the headset a BDS analytics are

1752
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:53,760
two companies that you know I've been

1753
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:55,620
doing making great strides and trying to

1754
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,330
solve this problem and trying to figure

1755
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:59,130
out how to normalize data across the

1756
01:07:57,329 --> 01:08:01,400
industry and run analysis of that data

1757
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:03,900
so you know they can already provide

1758
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,320
trend information about what sort of

1759
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,400
products

1760
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,019
trending up what sort of products are

1761
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,000
trending down and a lot of I know

1762
01:08:07,019 --> 01:08:10,619
operators are using that data to be very

1763
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,869
to be more efficient in their operation

1764
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:14,819
but at the end of the day it doesn't

1765
01:08:12,869 --> 01:08:18,059
exist the most simple like single

1766
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:19,650
product Universal traceability system

1767
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,820
doesn't exist and again I think that's

1768
01:08:19,649 --> 01:08:24,029
another opportunity for a blockchain

1769
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:26,119
solution to have a centralized registry

1770
01:08:24,029 --> 01:08:29,599
based on the blockchain

1771
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:32,279
you got any more questions guys Oh Rahul

1772
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,820
okay so the question is when when we

1773
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:37,858
refer to a blockchain or the blockchain

1774
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:39,689
which actual blockchain are people

1775
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:41,910
running off of is it aetherium or is it

1776
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:43,289
another chain of proprietary and I think

1777
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:46,769
both these guys have their own answers

1778
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:49,649
to that question so my company uses

1779
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:51,630
proprietary blockchain it was developed

1780
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:54,539
for the music industry years ago to

1781
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:55,800
capture song data and then royalty data

1782
01:08:54,539 --> 01:08:58,019
so it couldn't be altered to ensure

1783
01:08:55,800 --> 01:09:00,239
everybody got paid so that's we turn

1784
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:01,920
that into a FinTech product and so again

1785
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:03,380
we we own the exchange and we own the

1786
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,100
tokens that's why we're able to do

1787
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:07,289
transactions in the background without

1788
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:11,910
outside interference so we're not a

1789
01:09:07,289 --> 01:09:14,789
distributed ledger well we've been at

1790
01:09:11,909 --> 01:09:16,439
least considering working with on the

1791
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:20,159
stellar platform especially because of

1792
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:22,379
their partner stellar because of the

1793
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,338
partnership with IBM healthcare and we'd

1794
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,420
also been working with them for

1795
01:09:23,338 --> 01:09:28,079
different direction

1796
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:31,140
kind of came back around nicely we work

1797
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:32,789
with the - network you know I've been

1798
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:34,740
working closely at the founder and the

1799
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:37,050
CEO and basically what they did was they

1800
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:38,849
took a look at the blockchain protocol

1801
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:41,010
and they've improved upon it you know

1802
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:42,690
from blockchain scalability to

1803
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,670
transaction time transaction cost so

1804
01:09:42,689 --> 01:09:46,679
given the fact that you know they've

1805
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:49,230
improved on the metrics that you know

1806
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:53,159
was first introduced into the industry

1807
01:09:49,229 --> 01:09:55,919
in 2008 - is the it proves to be kind of

1808
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:58,099
the transactional blockchain that that

1809
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,600
works best for our project and for

1810
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:03,420
transactional money transfer monetary

1811
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:05,010
purposes right just to clarify one thing

1812
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:06,779
there I know we talked about transaction

1813
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:10,130
speed earlier and efficiency and it was

1814
01:10:06,779 --> 01:10:10,130
a question about it from the audience

1815
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:14,449
the speed at which transactions complete

1816
01:10:12,618 --> 01:10:16,578
is something that's very it's crucial to

1817
01:10:14,448 --> 01:10:17,569
this sort of solution right I mean you

1818
01:10:16,578 --> 01:10:19,819
can probably beat this better than I can

1819
01:10:17,569 --> 01:10:22,210
can block a Bitcoin is how long is the

1820
01:10:19,819 --> 01:10:24,229
average transaction taking right now

1821
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:25,520
four to eight minutes can spike up to

1822
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:27,169
thirty minutes for a transaction to

1823
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,300
finish right so if you're looking at

1824
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:30,469
this as a solution to I'm standing in

1825
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,929
front of the point-of-sale wanting to

1826
01:10:30,469 --> 01:10:34,069
pay for something it's just not it's not

1827
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:36,139
viable you just can't do it you can't

1828
01:10:34,069 --> 01:10:37,250
ask someone to stand there for up to

1829
01:10:36,139 --> 01:10:38,750
thirty minutes waiting for their

1830
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:42,288
transaction to complete for that

1831
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:44,260
transaction for in order to use that on

1832
01:10:42,288 --> 01:10:47,420
a regular basis so the the fact that

1833
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:48,710
alternis six is using - specifically if

1834
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,480
I'm not mistaken one of the reasons is

1835
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:52,038
because of performance right we got a

1836
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:54,169
transaction time - she's got a

1837
01:10:52,038 --> 01:10:57,050
transaction time down to a fraction of a

1838
01:10:54,170 --> 01:11:00,770
second and transaction costs a fraction

1839
01:10:57,050 --> 01:11:02,480
of a cent so I mean from a from a

1840
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:03,500
utility perspective you know the

1841
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:05,118
merchant doesn't want to pay a high

1842
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,859
transaction fees the customer doesn't

1843
01:11:05,118 --> 01:11:08,598
want to stand at the point-of-sale so

1844
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:10,069
you have to be able to it's a two-sided

1845
01:11:08,599 --> 01:11:12,050
platform so you have to be able to

1846
01:11:10,069 --> 01:11:15,078
maximize utility for both parties

1847
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:17,000
involved and I think - the way that they

1848
01:11:15,078 --> 01:11:19,368
built out their network has been able to

1849
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,500
tackle all those different components a

1850
01:11:19,368 --> 01:11:22,308
lot of people don't realize this but no

1851
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,529
one really knew what they were getting

1852
01:11:22,309 --> 01:11:27,230
into when they built these exchanges

1853
01:11:24,529 --> 01:11:28,550
early on and one of the major flaws of

1854
01:11:27,229 --> 01:11:30,229
you know since no-one's representing

1855
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:32,570
Bitcoin here I'll just go ahead and and

1856
01:11:30,229 --> 01:11:34,698
talk about them one of the major flaws

1857
01:11:32,569 --> 01:11:37,340
of Bitcoin is that no one really took

1858
01:11:34,698 --> 01:11:39,169
into account that the transaction time

1859
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:41,210
was going to grow somewhat exponentially

1860
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:43,819
with the size of the network so their

1861
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:45,380
own success is their undoing you know

1862
01:11:43,819 --> 01:11:47,118
the more transactions that happen on the

1863
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:48,949
system the slower the transactions

1864
01:11:47,118 --> 01:11:50,689
become and it gets worse and worse like

1865
01:11:48,948 --> 01:11:53,198
a lot worse over time so it'll be

1866
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:55,399
interesting to see where that ends up

1867
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:57,439
and all here's the other thing you can't

1868
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:59,210
just like stop trading and like fix it

1869
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:01,519
right it's just kind of like it just is

1870
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:03,439
what it is and so we'll have to see what

1871
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,030
that means for the for the Bitcoin

1872
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:07,609
community and I know that other

1873
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:09,439
exchanges have looked further ahead than

1874
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:11,029
that one thing that you got to think

1875
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:14,839
about as well is who makes the decisions

1876
01:12:11,029 --> 01:12:17,179
in blockchain network the miners those

1877
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:19,159
that are solving the hash algorithms

1878
01:12:17,179 --> 01:12:22,730
that are that are that are verifying

1879
01:12:19,158 --> 01:12:23,808
transactions and where are these miners

1880
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:25,428
located

1881
01:12:23,809 --> 01:12:27,469
they're in China right now and they're

1882
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:29,149
based next to dams that and they're in

1883
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:30,250
there paying off Chinese officials so

1884
01:12:29,149 --> 01:12:33,019
that way they can get free electricity

1885
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:35,149
right now the Bitcoin network uses as

1886
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:37,159
much electricity as a country at Denmark

1887
01:12:35,149 --> 01:12:39,710
was Ireland last year it's up to the

1888
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:41,868
country of Denmark so when you think

1889
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:45,020
about a governance perspective who makes

1890
01:12:41,868 --> 01:12:46,639
the decisions in the Bitcoin network the

1891
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:48,380
reason we're not another reason we chose

1892
01:12:46,639 --> 01:12:49,788
- as well is because they built in a

1893
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:53,150
second-tier governance system that

1894
01:12:49,788 --> 01:12:55,340
allows actually the members in the the

1895
01:12:53,149 --> 01:12:57,979
network to be able to vote and it's a

1896
01:12:55,340 --> 01:13:00,679
truly democratic network it's it's

1897
01:12:57,979 --> 01:13:02,538
pretty amazing kind of fully encompasses

1898
01:13:00,679 --> 01:13:04,819
the decentralization of the blockchain

1899
01:13:02,538 --> 01:13:06,469
it's great awesome we have one last

1900
01:13:04,819 --> 01:13:09,408
question from anybody Tory's thinking

1901
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:13,309
about wrapping it up no well we got one

1902
01:13:09,408 --> 01:13:15,408
more okay so the question is when do we

1903
01:13:13,309 --> 01:13:17,420
all think that I'm assuming you're

1904
01:13:15,408 --> 01:13:21,198
talking about cannabis legalization that

1905
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:23,510
cannabis will be federally legal and how

1906
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:27,379
what should we anticipate like what's

1907
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:28,760
gonna happen I'll start I'll throw that

1908
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:31,750
out that it's a conversation that I

1909
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:34,130
think we all have on a regular basis

1910
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:35,809
some people are saying as long as five

1911
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:38,359
to ten years I think that's far too out

1912
01:13:35,809 --> 01:13:40,699
in the future I think it's going to be

1913
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:43,429
used as political leverage in the next

1914
01:13:40,698 --> 01:13:45,558
presidential election I think that

1915
01:13:43,429 --> 01:13:47,328
everything that we're seeing happen

1916
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:49,460
right now on the East Coast

1917
01:13:47,328 --> 01:13:51,920
if you look at the legalization dominoes

1918
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:53,448
that are falling on the East Coast Chris

1919
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,010
Christie gets put out of office by a guy

1920
01:13:53,448 --> 01:13:56,928
who says you don't legalize cannabis lo

1921
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:58,730
and behold he actually does it Cuomo

1922
01:13:56,929 --> 01:13:59,960
goes goddamnit now I have to do this

1923
01:13:58,729 --> 01:14:01,578
thing because Cynthia Nixon is also

1924
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,989
breathing down his neck telling him that

1925
01:14:01,578 --> 01:14:04,399
you know I'm gonna run on a legalization

1926
01:14:02,988 --> 01:14:06,019
platform whether or not she wins he

1927
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:07,308
still has to change it right not to

1928
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:08,539
mention they both got Massachusetts

1929
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:10,369
looking over their shoulder going hey

1930
01:14:08,538 --> 01:14:13,189
well we're about to do this in earnest

1931
01:14:10,368 --> 01:14:17,089
starting next month and you know unlike

1932
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:19,129
the states in where everything is legal

1933
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:21,260
now Colorado Oregon Washington where

1934
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:23,389
they're relatively isolated you can be

1935
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:26,239
in half of the eastern seaboard within

1936
01:14:23,389 --> 01:14:28,069
half a day's Drive right so you know

1937
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:29,178
it's I think we'd be naive to say that

1938
01:14:28,069 --> 01:14:30,679
people are gonna stay within their

1939
01:14:29,179 --> 01:14:32,420
states to buy the cannabis if they want

1940
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:34,489
right there's gonna be stuck nothing

1941
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,019
stopping anyone from driving from New

1942
01:14:34,488 --> 01:14:36,979
York to Massachusetts once a month to

1943
01:14:36,019 --> 01:14:41,360
pick up their medicine

1944
01:14:36,979 --> 01:14:44,089
right and so that that tax that loss of

1945
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:45,529
tax revenue on top of the fact that this

1946
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:48,230
is totally political leverage right now

1947
01:14:45,529 --> 01:14:50,149
I think will mean that I'm calling it

1948
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:52,750
two to three years before we start

1949
01:14:50,149 --> 01:14:52,750
seeing rumblings

1950
01:14:52,760 --> 01:15:00,110
I absolutely it's not gonna happen to

1951
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:03,320
within this administration I actually

1952
01:15:00,109 --> 01:15:08,149
have the same exact thoughts he has on

1953
01:15:03,319 --> 01:15:12,619
this yeah I agree except I think that

1954
01:15:08,149 --> 01:15:14,869
CBD and perhaps maybe from cannabis

1955
01:15:12,619 --> 01:15:17,029
maybe only from hemp will be federally

1956
01:15:14,869 --> 01:15:19,579
legal by next summer

1957
01:15:17,029 --> 01:15:21,050
I think CBD is gonna happen real fast

1958
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:23,569
the farm bill just basically did that

1959
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:27,650
right and right and I think full

1960
01:15:23,569 --> 01:15:29,479
interstate transport everything's that's

1961
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:31,189
where I was gonna go CBD and hemp is

1962
01:15:29,479 --> 01:15:33,619
gonna be what's gonna be legalized first

1963
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:36,079
across the board and right now I can

1964
01:15:33,619 --> 01:15:38,960
transact in all 50 states so as far as a

1965
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:40,279
product goes it's it's up and going and

1966
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,439
it's pretty amazing I mean the health

1967
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:44,750
benefits there outweigh and more

1968
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:46,099
importantly the marketplace right my

1969
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:48,800
parents have never smoked weed in their

1970
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:50,630
life but they're taking CBD now and they

1971
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,400
feel amazing because of it right so

1972
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,720
let's think about it how many how many

1973
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:55,099
people will actually want the siphon

1974
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,170
topic effects and how many people want

1975
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,340
the benefits well that markets gonna

1976
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:00,230
outweigh and guess what guess what the

1977
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:01,909
government wants taxes and they want

1978
01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:03,379
they want to get received that revenue

1979
01:16:01,909 --> 01:16:05,420
base and that's what's gonna change the

1980
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:09,230
market is the ability to capture that

1981
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:11,149
revenue awesome guys please help me

1982
01:16:09,229 --> 01:16:13,909
thank these guys for taking the time

1985
01:16:14,869 --> 01:16:17,449

01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:19,310
