hey good morning skip thank you very

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,359
very much for making the time

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,320
absolutely we've got some exciting stuff

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,679
hear about your background you've got a

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,359
very interesting background in the

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,119
cannabis space

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,799
yeah absolutely well i've been in it for

20
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,399
almost a decade and a half on the legal

21
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,519
side but originally from farm country in

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,280
wisconsin

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,280
i did four years in the united states

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,120
air force and got hurt in the service

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
came out to colorado for a pretty place

26
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,038
to recover and found medical cannabis

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,480
got a medical card very very early

28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,480
back before any of the commercial

29
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,439
medical or adult use programs were even

30
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,358
started

31
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,599
but then through that process 2006

32
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,879
through 2008 i saw the first commercial

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,960
business licenses

34
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,319
actually happening in colorado and

35
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,839
through that process helped a lot of

36
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,239
friends and caregivers start to make

37
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,640
those

38
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,920
first initial commercial cannabis

39
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,000
businesses that were licensed and

40
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,680
regulated by the state of colorado

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,118
through that now we've gone up to 34

42
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,759
states that have some sort of medical

43
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,079
program

44
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,000
11 states that have adult use programs

45
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,319
and over 21 countries that have some

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,640
sort of international medical cannabis

47
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,000
regime there's also canada and uruguay

48
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,599
that have international adult use

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
programs and through this process

50
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,199
have worked in nearly 30 countries over

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
30 states

52
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,478
with cultivation companies extraction

53
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,759
companies packaging

54
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,078
companies manufacturing investment firms

55
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,519
and

56
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,879
have really seen all segments of the

57
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,158
industry so when i look at the

58
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,039
investment

59
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,240
space cannabis by not being federally

60
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,640
legal we have this

61
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,199
massive void of where you can actually

62
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,359
get capital for funding businesses

63
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,960
so we work with small medium large-sized

64
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,640
companies in their fundraising pursuits

65
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,319
as well as structuring their businesses

66
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
to get business licenses so

67
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,798
be it the operations or the ancillary

68
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,478
services and companies that service them

69
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,118
we've worked with this and been here for

70
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,038
almost 15 years

71
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,719
great thanks nick maybe we'll just touch

72
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,519
for a second on federal regular

73
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,479
regulation

74
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,959
um we've got an election coming up uh

75
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,238
biden chose kamala

76
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,080
you know we're not sure what's going to

77
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,080
happen there but what are your thoughts

78
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
either way on cannabis federal

79
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,360
regulation changing

80
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,199
well the united states is a big

81
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
superpower we think that the world

82
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,439
really responds to our movements sadly

83
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,120
when it comes to international drug

84
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,039
policy and reform

85
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,120
we're not the leaders of that that's

86
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,039
through the who the world health

87
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,239
organization and the un like the united

88
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,000
nations

89
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,280
now if you're a native american you

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,719
probably wouldn't trust the united

91
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,840
states government following certain

92
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,439
treaties

93
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,920
and some of the treaties that we follow

94
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,439
for international drug policy are just

95
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,280
that like the single

96
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,079
convention on psychotropic substances

97
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,039
from 1961 and 1971 from the united

98
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,879
nations

99
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,719
so before there's some sort of federal

100
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,840
legalization

101
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,719
i would more expect some sort of federal

102
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,920
decriminalization similar to like what

103
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,519
portugal did

104
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,958
um in which many states and

105
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,039
municipalities around the country have

106
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,239
already started for decriminalizing

107
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,000
cannabis

108
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,759
medical cannabis being a disabled

109
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,759
veteran myself is is my

110
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,000
my forefront and really my passion

111
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,318
helping patients get access to safe

112
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,759
quality and affordable medicines but in

113
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,598
the united states

114
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,318
be it one president or another they

115
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,719
don't necessarily have the power to just

116
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,359
legalize cannabis be it medical or adult

117
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,120
use

118
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,400
because it could put the united states

119
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,480
in jeopardy of certain

120
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,640
international conventions which allow

121
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,318
for pharmaceutical manufacturing

122
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,598
imports and exports of psychotropic

123
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:49,518
substances which cannabis currently is

124
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:52,079
so even though biden and his new vp

125
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,560
canada and with with trump neither one

126
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,400
has a very strong position on cannabis

127
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,598
nor a negative one so

128
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,840
my thoughts at least when it comes to

129
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:05,438
federal legalization

130
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,360
our industry is so nation it's not ready

131
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,840
to be federally legalized we do need

132
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,680
decriminalization you need

133
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,598
like the war on drugs to stop and stop

134
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,360
putting people in jail for having a gram

135
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,439
of cannabis and ruining their chances to

136
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,519
get student loans or

137
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,759
jobs in the future especially if they're

138
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,478
using it for medicinal reasons

139
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,479
but i really think that depending on who

140
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,478
gets elected this next year it really is

141
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,000
going to give the industry another

142
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,240
four and a half five years to get its

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,439
shit together because we as an industry

144
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,759
where this patchwork

145
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,279
of different states different rules

146
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,840
different laws where

147
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,119
cannabis prices might be 600 wholesale

148
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,439
in oregon where there's massive

149
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,280
production copious amounts of licenses

150
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,959
and then a state like illinois where

151
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,559
there's only 12 adult use producers

152
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,359
currently until the next licenses are

153
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,040
awarded

154
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,919
where grams could be upwards of twenty

155
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,360
thirty dollars for a gram of cannabis

156
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,959
now it wouldn't be very hard to to move

157
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
beef jerky from one state where they

158
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,159
have lots of cows to a state that wants

159
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,360
to buy a bunch of beef jerky that

160
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,840
doesn't have many cows

161
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,160
but currently based on federal you know

162
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,478
legalization and the lack thereof

163
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,080
interstate commerce isn't an option so i

164
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,079
see this next four to five years really

165
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,000
is an opportunity for the industry

166
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,918
in their own states and jurisdictions to

167
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,918
continue to create market share

168
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,560
develop new products understand consumer

169
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,038
trends and get larger and larger

170
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,879
so when federal legalization or

171
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,120
decriminalization happens on a medical

172
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,600
standpoint or adult use standpoint

173
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
the industry goes from being a patchwork

174
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,720
hodgepodge of all these

175
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,959
thousands of companies all over doing

176
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,880
different things into an

177
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,000
industry that's ready and primed for

178
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,560
strategic m

179
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,759
as mergers and acquisitions massive

180
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,280
companies going public

181
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,280
on nasdaq not just crappy little startup

182
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,319
you know penny stocks in canada that

183
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,758
have some of which have turned

184
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:56,560
large but that's really the moment where

185
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,600
if trump stays in power we have another

186
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,280
four years of

187
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
of the same thing same shit different

188
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,198
day probably a lot worse at least when

189
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,280
it comes to things outside of cannabis

190
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,639
but i wouldn't expect more federal legal

191
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,119
like intervention

192
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,400
the industry is too big to fail at this

193
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,759
point where you have

194
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:16,879
nearly 300 000 jobs created in the space

195
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,879
you know colorado i just saw for

196
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:24,159
july just record sales set almost 190

197
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,120
158 million in one month of a dollar

198
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
sales

199
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,240
add up the medical sales almost 200

200
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,160
million dollars in revenue it's nearly

201
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,400
seven million dollars in sales a day

202
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
happening and that's just the products

203
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,599
not for the electricity the buildings

204
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,240
the lights the water the fertigation the

205
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,720
packaging the legal the consulting

206
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,478
on and on and on so the industry is

207
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,400
growing so large but we do need to have

208
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,478
some sort of federal reform

209
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,439
where it's the federal government cannot

210
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,478
continue to use

211
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:55,680
funds against state legal and sanctions

212
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:57,360
medical or i don't use cannabis programs

213
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,120
you see other countries evolving with

214
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,479
this at the same time where uruguay just

215
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,959
approved exports

216
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,079
not just on a medical standpoint but

217
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,000
they're trying to figure out how to

218
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,399
export adult use cannabis

219
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to canada and to other countries so we

220
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:14,079
see more countries looking to this

221
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,560
and more municipalities losing tax

222
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,079
there's more even cities and counties

223
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,680
within states that are legal

224
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,439
that have had moratorium we don't have

225
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
hospitality we don't have hotels we

226
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,918
don't have as many taxes coming in

227
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,520
we're losing a lot of jobs nearly 50

228
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,240
million people unemployed in the united

229
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,240
states

230
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,360
here's this new industry that's

231
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,160
regulated

232
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,240
that could be a new opportunity for tax

233
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,560
revenue and job creation

234
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
so i think many cities within legal

235
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,759
states are thinking that

236
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,439
we already have 13 states that are

237
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,479
pushing ballot initiatives for this

238
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,240
november

239
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,079
to start to legalize the process be it

240
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,759
for medical or to move for a dollar use

241
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,758
just like arizona

242
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,080
so i'm really optimistic for this next

243
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,240
amount of time regardless of which

244
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,240
presidential candidate gets elected

245
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,680
which you know hopefully um

246
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,680
hopefully americans and voters make the

247
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,439
right decision here but

248
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,598
it's not going to impact our industry as

249
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,319
much as others might think

250
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,719
yeah so it's a complex patchwork and

251
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,319
yeah

252
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,080
i agree nick i think the number of

253
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,840
processes at the federal level for

254
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,758
legalization would be immense i mean all

255
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,758
the agencies everybody would

256
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,439
just the way that it would have to go

257
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
would take years anyway but

258
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,120
one step at a time i guess let's move to

259
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,959
investment so

260
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,038
when you think about investment then

261
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,120
with all of that on the horizon

262
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,838
what do you like are you are you

263
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,440
favorable for distressed type assets

264
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,080
do you like limited license

265
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,039
opportunities or cash flow companies

266
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,879
what's on your mind well the the

267
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,278
coronavirus kind of caught us off guard

268
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,958
as

269
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,278
as a people you know be in the united

270
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,119
states and all over the world

271
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,120
it's got people for the first time

272
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,839
having this like fear and also something

273
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,399
that's unifying all of us

274
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,720
the fear is the biggest danger when it

275
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,559
comes to the coronavirus right now

276
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,560
where people don't know what the fuck's

277
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,079
happening what's going to be happening

278
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,759
am i going to lose my job am i going

279
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,800
back to school

280
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,480
i there's so much concern here that it

281
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,439
really causes deer in the headlight

282
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,839
syndrome

283
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,200
where be it companies be it operators

284
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,120
via consumers

285
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,360
have no idea what's happening

286
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
the regulators as well so the investment

287
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,919
landscape when you think

288
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,360
last week last year there was almost 15

289
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,519
times more direct investment in the week

290
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,039
than there was last week this year

291
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,799
so consumer spending patterns are down

292
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,240
but cannabis sales stay up

293
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,919
so we know this plant is recession and

294
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,759
depression proof

295
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:45,519
100 percent the industry not so much

296
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,200
we're not federally legal we don't have

297
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,679
bankruptcy protections we had

298
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,200
no access to any of the sba loans the

299
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,439
ppp loans

300
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,680
the multi-trillion dollars in stimulus

301
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,680
our industries didn't qualify

302
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,359
so when it comes to investments now many

303
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,958
companies that were growing and scaling

304
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,278
on a normal trajectory

305
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,119
lost access to even interested investors

306
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,200
because those investors are like

307
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,120
i have no idea what's going on this

308
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,879
whole thing could go down

309
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,799
so much money has like come off the

310
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,159
table and

311
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,919
many investors like they're looking for

312
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,278
quick liquidity or options to be able to

313
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,799
make quick moves

314
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,639
and that's why the public companies are

315
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,319
so attractive when it comes to cannabis

316
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,759
to many investors now because they can

317
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,240
invest and pull out their money

318
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,879
you know the next day same day many of

319
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,799
the cannabis

320
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,078
industry for like early stage companies

321
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,879
thinking seed

322
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,599
capital series a series b series c

323
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,480
series d

324
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,240
ipos it's not the normal trajectory

325
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,159
right now it's it's a hold

326
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,519
survive weatherless storm because this

327
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,360
plant and the demand for it

328
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,039
has existed for hundreds of thousands

329
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,440
millions of years

330
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,278
from our species it's going to stay

331
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,399
around and the illicit market

332
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,480
is booming the legal industry is booming

333
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,919
but access to the capital to keep doors

334
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,399
open is lacking so

335
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,000
many of the things i'm liking now there

336
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,320
are like you said many distressed

337
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,078
assets companies that were doing great

338
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,320
were not prepared for this pandemic

339
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,919
how could you be thinking about social

340
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,760
distancing thinking about online

341
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,958
ordering curbside pickup

342
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,159
how do i maintain a staff of 200

343
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,399
cultivators

344
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,919
and tremors and massive operations on

345
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,839
multi-acre facilities

346
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,120
and keep them spread apart when i

347
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,600
normally would have them all

348
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,159
at certain places in the assembly line

349
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,920
so

350
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,519
i think the most valuable capital now is

351
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,240
for the companies that had proven track

352
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,799
records

353
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,278
had positive ebitdas have cash flows and

354
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,958
need

355
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,439
the capital to stay in business be it

356
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,039
ancillary or be it the direct hands-on

357
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,360
companies

358
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,559
right now there are still many licensing

359
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,399
opportunities available

360
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,639
in new states and jurisdictions even in

361
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,519
new countries for new licenses for

362
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,078
cultivation

363
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,959
manufacturing import export distribution

364
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,359
genetics r

365
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,958
d there's still opportunities and

366
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,519
limited licenses states

367
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,078
and countries you know in a state like

368
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,560
illinois

369
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,479
where there's only going to be about 150

370
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,399
dispensaries for

371
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,600
you know millions and millions of people

372
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,440
compared to colorado

373
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,519
it's a massive opportunity because it's

374
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,079
so limited and hard to get in

375
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,879
now would i invest into a cultivation

376
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,958
operation in

377
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,799
oregon right now or oklahoma or

378
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,879
washington or colorado where there's

379
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,958
thousands of these cultivators they're

380
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,439
all like maggots in a bucket

381
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,159
fighting for market share but limited

382
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,760
licenses

383
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,439
in new jurisdictions pre-corona corona

384
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,958
post corona will always be on the

385
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,560
forefront of my interest

386
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,039
because it's a new opportunity to help a

387
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,838
team develop a successful business

388
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,838
that then eventually big mergers and

389
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,040
acquisitions can happen from

390
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,560
also it's really intriguing right now

391
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,159
our supply chains

392
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,759
supply chains are broken i mean the

393
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,278
united states for

394
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,958
for months couldn't even figure out how

395
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,720
to like make a face covering

396
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,879
you think about complicated ethanol

397
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,639
extraction equipment o-rings

398
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,919
specific lighting filaments that are

399
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,039
needed for some of these cultivation

400
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,039
facilities

401
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,120
many of those went away when chrono

402
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,120
started it's you know getting harder and

403
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,879
harder to order certain goods so many of

404
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,440
the things that are the common

405
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,320
hate to say it the picks and shovels of

406
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,160
the industry

407
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
are not available most picks instead of

408
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,919
being 10 bucks a pick are like 37

409
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,839
a pick and these blue jeans that were 20

410
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,759
bucks are now 150

411
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,959
so there are opportunities for domestic

412
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,120
us companies or

413
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,879
companies in other jurisdictions that

414
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,720
can help to like alleviate

415
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,159
the supply shortage concerns that can

416
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,600
really corner markets

417
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,439
there's a few public companies i'm not

418
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,680
going to mention names that have been

419
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,440
silently acquiring many of the picks and

420
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,039
shovel companies in the industry

421
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,240
not talking here about gavita and

422
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,838
you know advanced nutrients and

423
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,759
different companies that do nutrient

424
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,279
lines and from monsanto based

425
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:48,319
this is like specifically steel benches

426
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,759
greenhouses lights extraction equipment

427
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,600
those are the companies that see like

428
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,519
this longer term vision knowing that as

429
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,199
the industry continues to produce

430
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,839
we're still going to need greenhouses

431
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,879
and packaging and analytical testing

432
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,240
and all of these other aspects that's

433
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,559
why i'm thinking now

434
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,680
distressed assets people that supply

435
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,000
goods and services

436
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,919
or companies that there's this thing

437
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,240
that happens with new companies like

438
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,838
burnout and already after working for

439
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,320
let's say three to five years and

440
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,240
scaling and taking market share and

441
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,920
bashing after competitors and going

442
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,240
after lawsuits normal companies

443
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,919
they get kind of burned out you had

444
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,120
normal company burnout on top of

445
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,120
pandemics some people

446
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,240
they just want out and they don't know

447
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,879
where the exit is

448
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,120
they can't just go public it's not easy

449
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,679
like 2018 to just sell yourself on some

450
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,000
concept to a canadian public company

451
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,198
so i think there's a lot of founders and

452
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,720
people that just

453
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,078
they're scared they don't know what the

454
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,240
future holds they built some good

455
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,239
companies and they just want out i saw

456
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,079
one in california yesterday

457
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,879
nine licenses on a parcel one of the

458
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,239
lowest tax jurisdictions in california

459
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,240
doing the mass this thing could almost

460
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,759
do a half a billion dollars in revenue

461
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,959
in the next five years

462
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,559
and they're right at the process of

463
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,638
needing to pull the trigger spend about

464
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,439
10 million to build this whole thing out

465
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,799
but for 8 million bucks they take a full

466
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,160
exit right now because they don't know

467
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,000
the future

468
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,559
they're homeschooling their kids they've

469
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,639
got things going on at home

470
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,919
all of that uncertainty leads to massive

471
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,198
opportunities like we say like when

472
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,278
there's blood in the water that's when

473
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:18,719
the sharks eat and now is the best time

474
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,039
i've ever seen

475
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,839
for making very strategic and positive

476
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:26,078
investments in the cannabis industry

477
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,880
great thanks nick let's talk about the

478
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:28,799
other side

479
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,720
um when you think of investments what

480
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,639
are your no's when do you walk

481
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,320
or what what signs do you see where you

482
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,879
just say no no you're not going to take

483
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,879
a look at it

484
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,360
you know as an investor it's always what

485
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,959
you say no to that's more important than

486
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,839
what you say yes to you that's right

487
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,518
and in cannabis for years it was just

488
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,720
like i'm a cannabis company

489
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,799
i'm going to be a billion dollar

490
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,199
industry i'm like

491
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,399
so any company that isn't rooted in

492
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,799
reality

493
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,519
and specifically whatever the company is

494
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,240
or does

495
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,078
if you take that word cannabis out and

496
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,919
you look at it if it's not attractive

497
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,599
from a normal business standpoint

498
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,599
it's not attractive to me on a cannabis

499
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,800
standpoint either just because it's

500
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,959
cannabis

501
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:13,359
it doesn't make you unique anymore like

502
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,439
what is your strategic advantage what's

503
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,320
your like unique thing that you do that

504
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,880
no one else does

505
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,800
is it protectable is it scalable is

506
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,720
there a possible exit from it

507
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,919
so many of the companies if it's a

508
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,199
hands-on company like a

509
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,958
plant touching company a grower a

510
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,519
manufacturer an edibles maker a

511
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,039
dispensary delivery company

512
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,720
i always look at what their jurisdiction

513
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,559
is what's the state

514
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,920
what's the trajectory for that state for

515
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,518
adult use legalization

516
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,919
or how's the adult use legalization

517
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,159
going what are the neighboring states

518
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,759
how many licenses did they issue what

519
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,600
are the tax like and costs and

520
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,120
maintaining that license

521
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,040
specifically like with that management

522
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,320
team like do they know cannabis do they

523
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,159
know outside industry

524
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,680
they know outside industry it's much

525
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,039
more important to me than just having

526
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,758
some unique

527
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,759
way of growing or this unique light that

528
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,318
tweaks this one little thing

529
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,759
it has to be forward-looking many of the

530
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,480
investment thesis

531
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,879
and pitches that i see currently it's

532
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,400
for what the industry was in 2016 to

533
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,319
2018.

534
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,679
this new light this new product is going

535
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,480
to double your yield

536
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,360
this it's not like the industrialization

537
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,798
of cannabis

538
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,918
and that's where the industry is going

539
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:22,558
instead of these small little

540
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,319
mom-and-pop

541
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,558
operators god bless them for making

542
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:29,519
medicine for people for years and years

543
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:32,079
but their cost of goods is so high

544
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,319
compared to a scaled large-scale company

545
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,759
i'm not interested in small little

546
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,960
cabinets where you can grow wheat under

547
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,558
your counter

548
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,960
or like some small little hand trim

549
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,798
machine or this thing to make butter

550
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,240
it's like what are large-scale

551
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:45,119
cultivators and operators going to be

552
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,880
using

553
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,399
where is the industry going and how are

554
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,039
they going to position themselves from

555
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,880
that

556
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,079
specifically even from like different

557
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,480
iep companies

558
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,798
from intellectual property or the drug

559
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,200
development drug discovery space

560
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,279
you know the common mantra in our world

561
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,880
when it comes to domestic us companies

562
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,319
this is where we make our money one of

563
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,799
the world's largest

564
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,480
cannabis markets but then the

565
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:09,279
international arena is what's going to

566
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,279
be long-term

567
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,038
so much more profitable and probably

568
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,319
where cannabis is produced and imported

569
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,319
to the united states

570
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,839
be it for medical purposes adult use

571
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,678
purposes bulk

572
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,759
api like active pharmaceutical

573
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,600
ingredient development

574
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,879
that's where the industry is going but

575
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,719
right now we have to operate in these

576
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,280
small little markets so

577
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,360
if it's unique in its small sort of

578
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,480
market share it hasn't made any past

579
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,000
mistakes

580
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,919
they had like if they're running their

581
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,480
companies they don't have past recalls

582
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,160
operational problems lawsuits but there

583
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,798
has to be something unique at this point

584
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,038
because just being cannabis isn't enough

585
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,960
you know what i watch out for i hear a

586
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,000
couple acronyms i hear cbd

587
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,160
i'm out almost instantaneously

588
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,079
great cannabinoid one of hundreds we

589
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,759
love it but then you get cbg popping up

590
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,199
cbn all of these varieties of

591
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,160
cannabinoids that we barely even

592
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,120
understand

593
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,080
but if you're just wagon of cbd now in

594
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,918
2020

595
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,839
you're shit out of luck friend you're

596
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,038
not unique you're not doing anything

597
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,480
special

598
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,960
thousands of other companies are doing

599
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,240
this before you the regulations keep on

600
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,160
changing so unless you already have

601
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,359
market share scale and something unique

602
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,720
in quality

603
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,719
how do we even know that that products

604
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,839
bonified tested legal to sell in

605
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,519
different markets

606
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,359
where is your bulk supply coming from

607
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,519
what makes you unique other than

608
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,359
buying 55 gallon drums with this oil

609
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,440
putting it into a package with a label

610
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,359
and hustling and just selling goods like

611
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,798
its nike shoes

612
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,439
so those are some of the things the

613
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,519
normal buzzword bandwagons

614
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,279
we see far too many of them and if you

615
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,720
don't have a license yet

616
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,079
and you're trying to go for a license

617
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,839
and raise capital no that's probably one

618
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,439
of the hardest places to do it

619
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,599
but getting that license getting that

620
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,960
valuation that's what really makes

621
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,038
something unique from a hands-on

622
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,120
standpoint as well

623
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,879
right let's follow on to that with some

624
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,558
talk about diligence so when you think

625
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,240
about investing then

626
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,079
you've covered some items and what you

627
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,120
just said but how do you go through

628
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,798
diligence and

629
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,158
you know how do you really validate

630
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,158
these things because i know

631
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,679
obviously with early stage you know

632
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,000
sometimes you're told things sometimes

633
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,798
you don't look like i know investors who

634
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,679
lost billions of dollars in the market

635
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,599
um

636
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,919
and you know diligence may have found

637
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,959
that with some skills and knowledge but

638
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,960
um how do you go about it nick it's kind

639
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,200
of like they say the numbers don't lie

640
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,640
and like trust but verify so if you're

641
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,919
an existing company

642
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,440
or if there's an existing company that's

643
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,520
raising capital first thing make some

644
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,159
audited financial statements not you

645
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,279
a certified like public accountant a

646
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,840
controller

647
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:40,000
an outsourced cfo really get your shit

648
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,079
together on a financial standpoint like

649
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,359
i i need to know how much money did you

650
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,558
start this company how have you been

651
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,158
using that capital

652
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,000
how have you redeployed that capital

653
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,919
strategically because then

654
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,200
i'm thinking if i'm going to trust you

655
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,840
with my capital or

656
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,440
my lp's capital do you know what you're

657
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,839
doing and have you used the capital you

658
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,600
had before strategically

659
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,599
also have you gotten all of your legal

660
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,599
due diligence ducks in a row

661
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,719
like is the company formed correctly

662
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,359
board consent

663
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,120
controls stock options warrants like

664
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,678
what have you really done to create the

665
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,839
infrastructure legally for the company

666
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,840
is it protected all of those things

667
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,798
they'll say oh we filed for our patents

668
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,879
perfect

669
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,158
it better be part of your data room so

670
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,600
if you're raising cap or one of the

671
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
things i look for right away

672
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,678
even in the initial conversations have

673
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,759
they put together a data room

674
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,759
do they have a business plan not like a

675
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,000
1980s business plan but

676
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,200
i need to know 10 key things from that

677
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,798
business plan

678
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,480
have they just made a fancy pitch deck

679
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,319
is it just some

680
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,839
some guy that created some video games

681
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,639
that can pitch and sound good looking

682
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,918
for money

683
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,520
but doesn't really provide good returns

684
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,440
there's a lot of charlatans a lot of

685
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,158
fraudsters out there and cannabis

686
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,519
it came from not the most legal place so

687
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,880
it didn't bring forth a lot of really

688
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,480
good quality people

689
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,039
but you have to understand the metrics

690
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,960
of your business so the due diligence

691
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,480
do they have the licenses they say so

692
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,640
much of this is public record

693
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,519
how transparent are they who are their

694
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,000
other owners

695
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,279
like i said audited financial statements

696
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
what's their strategic

697
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,319
capital deployment plan or if i say to

698
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,839
them

699
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,119
in a due diligence calling what's your

700
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,199
five-year plan where do you see this

701
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,879
company in five years

702
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,720
oh geez i haven't really thought about

703
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,400
that i'm out

704
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,079
because you're supposed to use this

705
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,240
capital to get bigger

706
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,000
take more market share be more impactful

707
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,319
and a more successful business if you

708
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,440
don't know or have an idea or a vision

709
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,200
of where you're going to be in five

710
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,480
years how am i supposed to trust that

711
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
you're going to use my capital

712
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,400
wisely tomorrow but you also need to

713
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,679
specifically know what that due

714
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,120
diligence

715
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,200
based on their audited financial

716
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,399
statements with their cash flow

717
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,679
trajectory plan

718
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,919
of how are they going to deploy that

719
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,679
capital with this five million dollars

720
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,840
we're going to use 2.4 million dollars

721
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,519
to buy this

722
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:52,079
1.25 to do this here's our monthly burn

723
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:53,918
rate

724
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,918
staffing payroll marketing branding

725
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,159
legal tax compliance

726
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,000
i need to see those line items that they

727
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,280
budgeted out a plan for how to use

728
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,519
someone else's money

729
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,279
to make that company grow which many

730
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,599
people just think i need like

731
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,599
i know three to five million bucks if

732
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,279
they say that in a due diligence process

733
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:12,719
i'm not interested either because they

734
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,480
don't know what they need

735
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,000
who they are how they're going to use

736
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,960
this capital and what they want to

737
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,558
become

738
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,798
that's really what you need to prove in

739
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:23,200
your due diligence and in your data room

740
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,119
gather all your documents make it easy

741
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,319
for the investors to say yes

742
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,719
give them the things they're going to

743
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,240
need to review i don't want to just be

744
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,679
like oh you need capital great we're in

745
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,400
some conversations and now we start

746
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,320
talking

747
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,480
months and months back and forth if

748
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,158
everything's ready and in one place

749
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,240
it's much easier to get to that yes or

750
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,278
no decision but they have to know

751
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,038
specifically

752
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,798
how much they need how they're going to

753
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,879
raise it and what's the next stage

754
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,278
growth of that company

755
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,960
great thanks let's talk global markets

756
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:51,839
for a second are there global markets

757
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,079
that you like

758
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,038
specific areas out in the world that

759
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,798
countries or

760
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,798
or larger that you think are are the

761
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,558
best opportunities

762
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,240
well you've got a lot i mean over this

763
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,918
last you know five years from

764
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,519
some you know we went from the united

765
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,880
states we started working in canada some

766
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,519
of the first opportunities then in

767
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,600
denmark

768
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,720
in germany then portugal and south

769
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,199
africa and then

770
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,159
colombia and peru and then sri lanka and

771
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
then

772
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,000
you know there's a lot of massive

773
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,158
opportunities out there people see this

774
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,558
is a very powerful medicinal plant

775
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,400
this is a very potential large-scale

776
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,119
industry that already is on the illicit

777
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,720
side

778
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,399
many countries are looking at it just

779
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,519
like states in the u.s for economic

780
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,440
growth

781
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,558
now when i think you know about the

782
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,240
earth which

783
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,839
sorry to the flat earthers out there but

784
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,120
it's probably a round planet to the best

785
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,639
of our knowledge

786
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,319
but countries that are close to the

787
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,600
equator cannabis is a dioecious plant

788
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,079
boy plant girl plant makes one crop a

789
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,319
year

790
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,558
makes a bunch of baby seeds dies grows

791
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,480
the next year from those seeds

792
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,720
how and where can i grow an agricultural

793
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,278
plant inexpensively

794
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,600
high quality and also that has certain

795
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:02,319
pharmaceutical compacts that's not

796
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:03,519
a hard country to do business in so i

797
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,879
look first at which countries are

798
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,119
legalized on that

799
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,159
granted patients need medicine in each

800
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,879
jurisdiction

801
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,320
but independent of canada or the united

802
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,520
states or uruguay right now i'm talking

803
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,439
the rest of the medical cannabis

804
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,798
industry in the world

805
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,880
each country is coming up with their own

806
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,599
program of importation

807
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,480
or standards or if they can cultivate or

808
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,079
manufacture

809
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,159
an international it's not about vape

810
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,119
pens and beverages and edibles and

811
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,240
topicals

812
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,359
it's about bulk flour and bulk oil if i

813
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,359
was dole

814
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,719
and i'm thinking about doing bananas i'm

815
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,519
probably not going to like get a bunch

816
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,200
of licenses

817
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,879
in denmark or some islands in the

818
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,360
english channel to grow a bunch of

819
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,840
demand

820
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,038
bananas to ship them around the world so

821
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,959
i like when i think about this

822
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,798
international programs

823
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,319
i've really been excited about mexico

824
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,759
for years but i've seen

825
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,960
what a shit show it's become when it

826
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,519
comes to their supreme court the

827
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,079
regulations canadian public companies

828
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,879
meddling and messing it all up combining

829
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,278
adult use

830
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,799
medical hemp all into one thing thinking

831
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,960
that was going to work

832
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,038
so i also look at the countries how they

833
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,278
set up their laws and policies with the

834
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,720
international narcotics control board

835
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,480
how are they thinking about actually

836
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,440
producing in their country for their own

837
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,919
constituents

838
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,880
and patients and then how potentially

839
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,880
through that would they have an

840
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,880
international export commodity

841
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,000
not just let's grow some weed and make

842
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,559
some money

843
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,960
that doesn't work no offense georgia no

844
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,480
offense macedonia no offense

845
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,240
greece no offense most of those

846
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,839
countries that did it in that way

847
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,440
and god bless them for taking the moment

848
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,599
to try to legalize something that's been

849
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,278
illegal for far too long

850
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,199
so internationally i think you know

851
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,400
mexico sounded exciting i think mexico

852
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,120
will be a great place for hemp in the

853
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,559
future

854
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,558
great for adult use tourism in the

855
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,399
future not going to be an international

856
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:47,918
medical cannabis leader

857
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,038
colombia really good law at first

858
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,000
kind of problematic processes and a lot

859
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:53,519
of groups just thought oh

860
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,440
colombia is perfect because it's near

861
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,960
the equator well yeah it is but then

862
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,919
you've got really high mountains you got

863
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,159
these

864
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,520
coastal sea places you've got past kind

865
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,200
of narco-terrorism

866
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,679
you've got unstable governments you've

867
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,759
got shoot past president aribe like

868
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,679
under house arrest right now

869
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,839
you know it's kind of powder keg but i

870
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,278
love colombia been there many many times

871
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,720
helped with many of the licenses there

872
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:15,599
and i see massive opportunity in

873
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,679
colombia

874
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,839
as well as in peru based on their

875
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,080
anticipated license process even though

876
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,759
it's already in the works

877
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,678
many people are interested in brazil i

878
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,519
think brazil is going to be a nightmare

879
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,880
great for hemp in the future but based

880
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,440
on the coronavirus and some other

881
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,760
aspects

882
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,038
i not mentioning anything about

883
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,158
corruption here

884
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,519
right now but brazil's gonna have some

885
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,799
problems the other ones that are

886
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,319
some of my favorite the european union

887
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:43,679
i mean massive kind of like the united

888
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,359
states when it comes to market share and

889
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,080
economic opportunities

890
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,599
it's cold as fuck in europe in the

891
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,359
winter and kind of sucks and there's a

892
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,319
bunch of people close together

893
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,719
land's expensive got angry people all

894
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,079
over

895
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,000
like not the place where you want to

896
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,278
grow bananas year round either

897
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,440
but then you have some countries like

898
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,359
spain and portugal with portugal with

899
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,480
some really amicable laws and licenses

900
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:09,439
that could be an eu gmp producer

901
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,558
of bulk api and flower and a possible

902
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,919
like bridge for other countries

903
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,440
producing

904
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,679
i also think that there's a few secret

905
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,159
countries in asia not talking right now

906
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,840
about

907
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,080
china and their cbd plays and all of

908
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,000
that or thailand's medical program now

909
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,199
but when you look at malaysia when you

910
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,319
look at the philippines when you look at

911
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,080
a couple of the other countries where

912
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,278
cannabis used to be like you talk about

913
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,359
it you die

914
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,679
compared to like now being picks

915
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,918
countries pic-s

916
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,759
might have some very unique economic

917
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,600
opportunities with this

918
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,200
australia had some opportunities really

919
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,240
early on their medical programs getting

920
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,319
better

921
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,399
but equally just like south africa and

922
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,278
other places the farther away from the

923
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:46,719
equator

924
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,319
with a photo period plant where i'm

925
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,240
trying to grow this year round where i

926
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,639
can have 12 hours of darkness 12 hours

927
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,038
of light

928
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,159
induce flowering i think internationally

929
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,440
be the countries with the best

930
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,000
regulations

931
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,679
that are the least unstable with the

932
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,679
best agricultural climates

933
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,720
and also favorable pharmaceutical laws

934
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,798
and regulations

935
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,960
that have not done things to shit on the

936
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:07,839
incb the international narcotics control

937
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,360
board

938
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,119
which is like keeps them in a high

939
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,359
standing for pharmaceutical drug

940
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:17,439
development drug discovery

941
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:19,278
israel yeah been awesome dr michonne

942
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,640
years of research all of the medical

943
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:21,119
licenses what some of those countries

944
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,679
have done

945
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,759
great some of the problems with tax

946
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,360
political instability

947
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,200
you know not a member of the european

948
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,479
union there's certain aspects where each

949
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,558
country kind of has

950
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,720
its strengths and weaknesses and to me

951
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,079
i'll never put all my eggs in one basket

952
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,319
and i think that long term it's going to

953
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,398
be a conglomeration

954
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,599
of various countries various companies

955
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:43,119
within those countries that are going to

956
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,038
take the massive market share that'll

957
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:48,558
get the massive pharmaceutical ex

958
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:51,839
like exits hence peru

959
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:53,278
colombia port portugal south africa has

960
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,000
a lot of promise a lot of problems with

961
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,240
coronavirus

962
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,679
right now as well the countries that can

963
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,278
weather this storm because

964
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,960
we've all been prepping for this u.n

965
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,000
vote that's supposed to happen

966
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,480
and keeps getting delayed from

967
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,278
coronavirus or china and russia kind of

968
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,120
mess with it but when the u.n through

969
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,159
the who and they change their stance on

970
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,558
this or a potential d

971
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,080
schedule or rescheduling that's when

972
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:14,879
international medical cannabis is going

973
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,158
to explode

974
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,760
and when that happens if you're trying

975
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,720
to get into a country you're already too

976
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,759
late

977
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,759
so at my stage prospecting the best

978
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,960
opportunities in the best new markets

979
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,278
to make the greatest good for the

980
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,200
greatest number also knowing

981
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:31,759
even if i'm in the best country with the

982
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,038
best laws and the best climate

983
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:38,640
shit happens companies fail

984
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:40,079
fraud deceit misappropriation of funds

985
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,759
i mean you built i mean if you've seen

986
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,199
like the movie gold it's like you build

987
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,480
this great thing you got this gold mine

988
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,679
that's going on you don't partner with

989
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,440
the right homies

990
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,720
government just takes away your license

991
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,080
gives it to the bigger homies that are

992
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,159
more homies with them i saw this

993
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:54,158
yesterday with a property

994
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,000
like it happens time and time again and

995
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,360
so knowing human nature you gotta like

996
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,720
really diversify your investment

997
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,558
strategies if you're getting into

998
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,079
international medical cannabis

999
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,398
or international adult use which is

1000
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,000
completely illegal but of course going

1001
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,278
to happen long term

1002
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,278
but going in and just going out there

1003
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,480
and prospecting and guessing most

1004
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:11,759
investors aren't going to find the right

1005
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,720
opportunities

1006
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,519
international has a huge long hold

1007
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,200
position

1008
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,640
it's not like i've got some short-term

1009
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,880
cash flow some medium term like

1010
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,000
acquisitions and ip deals

1011
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,720
and then a public offering or an m a you

1012
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,480
know long term

1013
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,839
they're all medium to long-term

1014
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,759
investments us

1015
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,199
is great for short medium and long but

1016
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,359
if you go into the international arena

1017
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,038
without the right guidance

1018
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,798
be it on investments or be it on the

1019
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,240
business operational side

1020
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,240
you're most likely going to get burned

1021
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,319
like we've seen to countless investors

1022
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,839
internationally

1023
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,000
great thanks nick we have time i think

1024
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,480
for one more question let's talk about

1025
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,240
investment vehicles now so all the rage

1026
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,720
on wall street these days are special

1027
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,798
purpose acquisition companies specs

1028
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,839
um we've seen some of these in cannabis

1029
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:57,918
pop up um

1030
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,879
obviously in the u.s not possible yet

1031
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,440
but other countries like canada they are

1032
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,320
any thoughts on specs as vehicles or

1033
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,320
what do you think

1034
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,240
how will those play a role in cannabis

1035
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,038
in the future

1036
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,159
specs are great and they've raised over

1037
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,240
two billion dollars

1038
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,240
just sitting dry powder just ready to go

1039
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,159
to war the problem with most of the

1040
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,919
specs which there's been a few of them

1041
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,600
is that their investment thesis and

1042
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,960
based on the valuations and like what

1043
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:24,319
they set their mandate that they would

1044
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,399
use that money for

1045
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,000
corona happened and they thought it was

1046
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,199
here and now it's here

1047
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,440
so a lot of them are just sitting and

1048
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,240
can't deploy that i think some very

1049
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,080
strategic

1050
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,159
special purpose acquisition vehicles for

1051
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,278
either joining single state operators

1052
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,720
where you've got

1053
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,720
let's call it dispensaries in california

1054
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,079
great state 40 million plus people huge

1055
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,839
revenue

1056
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,439
all broken down by municipalities in

1057
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,959
which cities are legal and not and how

1058
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,200
many they allow

1059
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,960
all that jazz but if there was a span

1060
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,278
for example it's like i'm gonna take

1061
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,640
a quarter billion dollars and roll up as

1062
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,960
many of these single

1063
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,720
operators into one company it's like

1064
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,919
there's 40 different gas stations i'm

1065
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,240
going to get them all and making them

1066
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,759
all

1067
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,359
shell that sort of acquisition vehicle

1068
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,679
now would be incredible

1069
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,278
many are desperate coronavirus we don't

1070
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,880
have like i said the federal bankrupt

1071
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,558
protection so i think there's some very

1072
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,720
strategic

1073
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,079
borderline predatory capital place that

1074
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,720
can help out the operators

1075
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,639
help out the investors help up industry

1076
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,759
so smacks are one option

1077
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,519
you know there's always the public

1078
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,398
option we're investing into public

1079
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,720
companies but

1080
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,158
who knows because 95 of what they say is

1081
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,399
complete fraud and lies

1082
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,640
it's all speculation like oh this could

1083
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,158
happen forward-looking statements

1084
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,000
and it's really hard to verify some of

1085
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,760
the information um i mean

1086
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,679
our stock portfolio side would be like

1087
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,319
up like 40 when it comes to like what's

1088
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,038
actually

1089
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,558
happening now but you can get burned

1090
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:47,038
very easily on these public companies

1091
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,558
because

1092
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:50,158
especially the canadian ones there's

1093
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,319
such lack of regulation

1094
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,760
and so much fraud and so much over over

1095
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,200
saturation that a lot of them are

1096
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,558
desperate right now

1097
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,038
i think a lot of the cannabis venture

1098
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,398
funds um

1099
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,440
seventy percent of them have no idea

1100
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:02,879
what they're doing in the industry they

1101
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,320
were great at goldman's

1102
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,679
great with lehman brothers great with

1103
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,359
all the other stuff they did in capital

1104
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,878
and wearing pinstripe suits

1105
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,559
but they didn't understand the industry

1106
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:11,759
and they they got distracted by these

1107
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:13,279
shiny things and

1108
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,879
that's a great idea and have lost

1109
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,639
hundreds of millions of dollars

1110
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,719
a few other ones are doing pretty well

1111
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,559
um i think that when you can find good

1112
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,118
fund managers even if it's

1113
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,759
small fee structure they know the

1114
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,280
industry

1115
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,440
it works in other industries it's like

1116
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,079
for starting early-stage companies

1117
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,599
so private venture funds i think are a

1118
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,440
really good way to go

1119
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,039
i also manage a few of those and i think

1120
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,639
that with i mean the amount of

1121
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,599
opportunities that we have that need

1122
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,000
investments

1123
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,960
for portfolio companies it's uh almost a

1124
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,119
no-brainer like

1125
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,199
not to go in this alone other other

1126
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,480
access campus reits

1127
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,878
real estate investment trust be it

1128
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,719
public or private i think are phenomenal

1129
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,159
because when you have cannabis

1130
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,838
operational companies you've got

1131
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,599
the need for property and lights and

1132
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,599
fertigation and rents and at least

1133
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,720
like all the tenant improvements that

1134
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,480
can be financed through

1135
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,639
real estate investments backed by the

1136
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,639
asset very secure

1137
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,239
what bill do you pay first every month

1138
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,559
your lease like it's where your license

1139
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:08,559
is

1140
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,159
that's why you have to do it so their

1141
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,639
returns are positive and always doing

1142
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,078
well

1143
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,598
as long as it's the right types of

1144
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,440
buildings in the right states with the

1145
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,200
right operators

1146
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,280
a lot of companies got burned on

1147
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,118
investing into the wrong ones of those

1148
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,960
and then there's always direct you know

1149
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,358
direct private placements

1150
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,240
private companies that need capital that

1151
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,480
you hear about

1152
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:30,639
need a couple million dollars health

1153
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,400
evaluation maybe get a board seat

1154
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,078
but like i said i don't put all my eggs

1155
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,079
in one basket putting all your

1156
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,640
investments into one company is very

1157
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,880
dangerous

1158
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,799
even if it's a baby little unicorn it

1159
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,240
can fall and break its leg

1160
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,320
you know it can get eaten by a wolf

1161
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,319
trampled by a guy in a buffalo

1162
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,359
so diversifying those investments be it

1163
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,400
through a re

1164
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,960
be it through if you're going to buy

1165
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,639
public stocks you know look at multiples

1166
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,519
like what's cresco doing what's gti

1167
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,519
doing what's truly

1168
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,960
doing not so much worrying about what

1169
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,719
medmen's doing anymore

1170
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,960
but like what are what are they doing

1171
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,399
and maybe put some in a few of those

1172
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,400
it's a good way to lose a lot of money

1173
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,000
too and with coronavirus

1174
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,920
i mean i have no idea how the public

1175
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,280
markets are doing so well

1176
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,519
but cannabis companies are starting to

1177
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,359
thrive through this so

1178
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,559
i'd say like best bet do your homework

1179
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,960
do your research

1180
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:18,320
coronavirus has completely changed our

1181
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,079
investment thesis

1182
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,240
instead of like what's our hold position

1183
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,760
what sort of companies meet our mandate

1184
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,519
right now i've definitely shifted my

1185
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,520
thesis a little to be

1186
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,880
adaptive in this time because there's so

1187
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,838
many companies that are doing great

1188
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,480
things

1189
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:34,639
making cash flow growing they just don't

1190
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,480
have that little extra gas or that turbo

1191
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,400
to make the turbo diesel like

1192
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,679
soar and they're just chugging up the

1193
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,039
hill so

1194
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,440
many of the private companies i think

1195
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,239
now need a couple extra gears to go a

1196
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,639
little faster

1197
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,399
ramp things up investors can probably

1198
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,078
get two or three times

1199
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,440
more for their money right now in this

1200
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,160
next couple months to the end of the

1201
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,400
year

1202
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,679
because this isn't going away anytime

1203
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,519
soon folks

1204
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,118
this is going to be around and we have

1205
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:01,519
to weather the storm we've already done

1206
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,039
it for 15 plus years as individuals

1207
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,800
the industry the plant's done it for

1208
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,320
hundreds of years with with the problems

1209
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,680
that we've thrown at it

1210
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,440
so now is like really the moment if

1211
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,358
you're gonna be investing

1212
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,119
a lot of sectors are dangerous probably

1213
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:14,480
investing into the cheesecake factory or

1214
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,640
dave and busters

1215
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,639
or best buy not your best options right

1216
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:21,118
now the whole world is changing

1217
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,480
one thing that's not changing is this a

1218
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,838
fucking amazing

1219
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,960
amazing plant that we honor love protect

1220
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:29,199
and our caregivers of

1221
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,720
and protect us as the industry grows the

1222
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,519
demand for this plant is only going to

1223
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,480
rise

1224
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,159
more jurisdictions will legalize better

1225
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,760
education will continue

1226
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,000
more people will be consuming this

1227
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,240
product we'll have new innovations from

1228
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,480
it

1229
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,319
new supplies needed to produce it to

1230
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,280
test it to regulate it

1231
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,800
to insure it to tax it all of it if

1232
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,320
there's one bat that i'm comfortable

1233
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,039
with especially during a fucking

1234
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,079
depressing

1235
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,119
pandemic alcohol sales look at what's

1236
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,640
happening way up

1237
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,240
not saying cannabis is just a vice

1238
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,639
industry

1239
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,078
but many people are using cannabis right

1240
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,719
now therapeutically

1241
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,400
stuck at home a lot of uncertainty get

1242
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,078
medicine to the people and this industry

1243
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,079
like i said we're not going anywhere

1244
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,599
many companies are going to fall but

1245
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,599
it's going to be a time to build new

1246
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,880
empires and it's a new

1247
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,480
like time in that game where you're like

1248
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,920
you shake up the pieces again to like

1249
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,440
see what happens the industry was

1250
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,200
getting pretty established

1251
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,440
players were getting bigger this thing

1252
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:25,439
just earthquake

1253
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,559
and now it's like okay what's going to

1254
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,400
happen but

1255
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,239
remember the earthquake's not over so as

1256
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,639
you're navigating the investment space

1257
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,559
business opportunities like know that

1258
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,000
things are going to continue to change

1259
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,559
but where you put those chits on the

1260
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,079
board you got to be out there in a

1261
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,358
with an umbrella singing in the rain

1262
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,240

1263
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:43,519
getting wet

1264
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,279
and a lot of companies are standing

1265
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,239
there getting wet and thinking like you

1266
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,320
know this is gonna pass

1267
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,479
sun's gonna come up i'm looking at the

1268
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,000
horizon friends it's gray it's shitty

1269
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,480
and it's gonna get worse

1270
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,559
