1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:15,298
I have fun with the Commission since

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,429
December 1st of 2018 which happened to

3
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,379
coincide with the first day that product

4
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:22,528
was available to patients in Maryland so

5
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:25,649
I get blamed for a lot of things that

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,910
has happened since then I actually get

7
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,428
blamed for a lot of things that happen

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,368
before them but we're working on those

9
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:35,489
things so as background I want everybody

10
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:39,240
to know that I came from health care and

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:41,940
I had a unique experience in my

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,670
healthcare career I started at the age

13
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:48,269
of 17 as a nurse's aide in the nursing

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,740
home and I will tell you that the very

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,870
first day I went home with a migraine

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,910
headache and said me and I don't know if

17
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:57,599
I can do this you know I don't know if I

18
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:58,229
can do this and I went back and I grew

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,450
to love it

20
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:03,959
I absolutely loved it I loved helping

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:06,570
people I loved taking care of taking

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,340
care of people and so you know that

23
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:11,129
really wasn't an integration into

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,020
healthcare from there I became a

25
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,379
laboratory scientist I'm a medical

26
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,329
technologist from there I became multi

27
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,158
departmental managers and hospitals I've

28
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:24,109
always worked in small rural hospitals

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,219
so one of the unique opportunities is to

30
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:29,010
get to do a lot of different things

31
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:32,700
there's less people so you just kind of

32
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:36,420
got a pitch in and and learn to do what

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,790
needs to be done so laboratory

34
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,519
scientists I became a quality director

35
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,219
in charge of quality for health care

36
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,310
programs in the hospitals I became a

37
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,989
risk manager looking at you know

38
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,840
mitigating risk what does that mean for

39
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:55,289
patients what processes do we have in

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,420
place and then became director of

41
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,270
compliance and regulatory affairs which

42
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,180
all of those things really were great

43
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:05,908
building blocks for what I'm doing now I

44
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,670
am a regulator I look at things through

45
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,210
a regular

46
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:14,199
lenz and I look at things through a

47
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:17,140
healthcare lens the focus in healthcare

48
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,419
is the patient and what are we doing for

49
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:22,958
the patient and what processes are we

50
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:25,269
putting in place to make sure that our

51
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,430
focus is on patient safety quality

52
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,159
services and things like that so that's

53
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,790
really my background and how I come to

54
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:37,509
the Commission it's really excited to be

55
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:39,489
able to have an influence on rolling

56
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:42,489
this healthcare program out for patients

57
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:44,879
across Maryland the cannabis space is a

58
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:47,319
little bit interesting in that regard

59
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,189
and that's a little bit what I want to

60
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,479
talk about tonight I'm Brent Gaytan

61
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:54,900
chief operating officer of remedy

62
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,899
Columbia

63
00:02:54,909 --> 00:03:02,139
Gavin heck I'm the assistant manager and

64
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:04,109
ideally that I'll just get right into it

65
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,518
and then we'll discuss have discussion

66
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,230
tell me what motivates you to work in

67
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,170
the medical cannabis industry and what

68
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:14,169
is the most satisfying aspect of doing

69
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:17,859
that I have a 20 year history of working

70
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:21,069
in IT as Quality Assurance professional

71
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,079
was calling and I have a sister who was

72
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:24,310
a programmer and became a nurse and I

73
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:27,519
was interested in kind of going into

74
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,560
healthcare but around the time I was

75
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,090
taking off prereqs from nursing I went

76
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,219
into a clinical trial at Hopkins matter

77
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,780
radiation injury so it kind of swerved

78
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:37,419
me away from being a hospice nurse and

79
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,640
then deer and two years ago finished a

80
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:41,078
master's at UMBC in the instructional

81
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,569
systems development so I wanted to kind

82
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,099
of apply my degree to a field that needs

83
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:51,759
training in the in this kind of process

84
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:54,129
okay thank you it's good for me I come

85
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,489
from food manufacturing supply chain

86
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:58,569
logistics the most recent venture was

87
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,579
right down the street

88
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,669
if you smell any brand and I used to run

89
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:05,540
the H&amp;S

90
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:08,119
agree there I used to run so with bread

91
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:10,340
comes a passion for all things and with

92
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,230
food comes a passion for all things my

93
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:19,370
passion is helping people helping people

94
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:21,918
and being a healer for them my

95
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,269
background with cannabis is I played

96
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,759
football in college and played football

97
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:28,668
you see a light back in the 90s and back

98
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,230
in the 90s if you recall gentleman by

99
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:33,289
the name of Jack Herer helped lead

100
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,150
proposition to California I was there

101
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,610
with him on the corner of Wilshire and

102
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:40,939
so verna in front of the Federal

103
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:44,030
Building protesting passing out medicine

104
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:47,600
enjoying medicine teaching and helping

105
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:50,750
people all about playing football UCLA I

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:56,000
enjoyed that lunch Miss Korea UCLA came

107
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:57,740
back to Maryland and have many people in

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,699
my family that have suffered from cancer

109
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:04,009
in different forms and different stages

110
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:07,610
they have been patients in Maryland and

111
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:09,529
across the United States so I have a

112
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:14,240
true appreciation for this medicine

113
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:15,918
dating back to the early 90s so tell me

114
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,160
what is the most satisfying aspect of

115
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:21,799
being in business when someone comes

116
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,710
back and says that it worked and they

117
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,629
had been I'm also of that and I've

118
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:28,339
started once on the effort one here

119
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:31,329
thirty years and I finally personally

120
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,329
found something works for me

121
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:37,089
relief that they've been seeking for

122
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:38,139
decades from institution or an entity

123
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:39,609
that really should have been able to

124
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,668
help them and then you kind of become

125
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,169
that enemy thank you I'd agree with that

126
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:45,818
and say that when patients definitely

127
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:48,189
come back and you see them at first and

128
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:49,960
they're using a walker or some aid and

129
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:51,728
they come back with the help and hate of

130
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,839
cannabis they no longer need that locker

131
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:54,758
that crutch

132
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,560
whatever it is and they come in they

133
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,449
thank you on the way into your

134
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,199
dispensary they stop and they give you

135
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:04,090
doughnuts I mean I don't bring my wife

136
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,129
doughnuts on there on a regular basis so

137
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:07,569
you know that that to me says that we're

138
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:51,430
doing what we need to do is serve our

139
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:53,288
patients comments I so remember one of

140
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,560
our first cases though we can of course

141
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:58,269
we do a month later he came back and

142
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,490
said you know you saved my marriage

143
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:03,098
I can get on the couch again I can play

144
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,949
with my kids during a human being and

145
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:08,620
I'm off of the scripts and even a loyal

146
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,500
patient could even walk into the store

147
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,660
or the shop

148
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,660
[Music]

149
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:36,769
okay through my like regulator lens my

150
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:38,299
next question comment first yes some of

151
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:41,718
the things that I've seen in this

152
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,869
medical only market are absolutely

153
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:54,649
shocking to me

154
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:57,439
so tell me breath yeah what business

155
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:59,959
strategies do you use in differentiating

156
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:04,429
your business model to focus on medical

157
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:08,028
only versus an adult use market whether

158
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:10,368
that's well if you're a grower out the

159
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:12,978
audience whether that's choosing

160
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:15,559
genetics whether you're a processor and

161
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:17,478
choosing the products you're going to

162
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:19,249
manufacture or if you're a dispensary

163
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:23,088
what are you gonna recommend to your

164
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:25,159
patients so for us I can tell you that

165
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:28,490
remedy Columbia we have a long history

166
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:31,188
of holistic of net and natural

167
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,649
healthcare dating back to 1974 when

168
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:35,569
acupuncture was illegal it was illegal

169
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:38,000
every state the nation except for

170
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:40,490
Maryland and Nevada our president and

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,350
founder mr. Bob Duggan who is no longer

172
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:47,000
with us on this earth founded the Tyson

173
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:51,670
PETA Institute in Columbia Maryland back

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,929
in 1974 when acupuncture was illegal

175
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:58,429
acupuncture and canvas or riding

176
00:08:53,929 --> 00:09:00,500
parallels right now so for us our

177
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:02,448
definition of medicine is anything that

178
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,720
helps maintain or can't bring you back

179
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:08,899
to homeostasis we start with that as a

180
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:14,110
basis and then levitate from there this

181
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:15,948
is us and our approach to the medicine

182
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,139
so

183
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:20,599
based off of our definition of medicine

184
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:22,789
medicine could be a smile medicine could

185
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,459
be jogging medic medicines anything that

186
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:30,230
helps you bring you back to homeostasis

187
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:32,448
so off of that our business practices to

188
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,308
use that as a guide and have a

189
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:35,778
conversation with people come in to

190
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:37,879
speak with us and let's have a

191
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:40,009
conversation about what we can help you

192
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:41,869
with what elements do you have that we

193
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:43,418
can help improve your life and your

194
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:45,829
well-being while your buyer with us

195
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:48,948
that's kind of that's kind of our take

196
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:52,128
on it out the guy answer your question

197
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:55,068
directly but indirectly that's who we

198
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:56,899
are and that's you know over the 7,000

199
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:59,958
patients that we've seen and continue to

200
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:02,839
see on a monthly basis that's our

201
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,508
approach and although I didn't really

202
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,059
shake it I was just tired a couple

203
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:09,438
months ago so the basic idea of the kept

204
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:11,328
stands for knowledge is power the idea

205
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:13,519
that if you don't have them in fun

206
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:14,808
customer informed patient they're not

207
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,089
going to be able to really negotiate the

208
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:19,009
process of being medicated properly the

209
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:21,499
other thing is we hired of registered

210
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:22,909
pharmacist and we have we encourage

211
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:24,619
everyone comes and if they have any

212
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:26,539
questions well to take the time to have

213
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:27,739
a consultation with them which is free

214
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:30,318
and them can be as long as they like

215
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:31,759
we've had people come in and talk to him

216
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:33,048
for five months who have people come in

217
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,089
and talk to him for two or three hours

218
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:38,178
it really held it and then we also have

219
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:39,980
a patient handout where they've got a

220
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:42,588
couple pages to track you know track

221
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,649
what he you know does to do the strains

222
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:47,660
and we encourage people to come back to

223
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:49,278
us but we also a policy of trying to you

224
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:51,110
know follow up with them if they want to

225
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,298
so glut will actually tell people and

226
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,339
that's kind of how I was going you know

227
00:10:53,298 --> 00:11:05,529
encourage them to just communicate with

228
00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:07,660
us early okay drivers

229
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:10,809
they're shooting the breeze and he was

230
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:12,850
watching people come in and someone lot

231
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:14,889
said and he goes that's a refuse someone

232
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,540
comes in he goes that's a rent user and

233
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,129
I realized two things one obviously had

234
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:20,319
a bias and I realized that I also had

235
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:22,899
that bias and for me it was like turning

236
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,440
a key I came to understand things from a

237
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:28,949
different perspective so just because

238
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:33,150
someone has been using this medicine

239
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,960
because it wasn't available legally or

240
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,279
because they got it from other ways

241
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,750
doesn't mean that they haven't been

242
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,360
using it for very important reasons

243
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,549
whether that's sleep anxiety pain but

244
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,430
absolutely and so I don't even think in

245
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:48,609
terms of rec and medical anymore I think

246
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:50,549
in terms of unguided and guided and I

247
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,350
think that what we want to do is

248
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:55,509
advocate everybody using this medicine

249
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,850
in a guided way instead of an unguided

250
00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:00,100
way regardless of how they get it now

251
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,360
when they can get medicine in this

252
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,860
program we know that they're getting

253
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,960
clean medicine we know that it doesn't

254
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,100
have be junk in it and we know exactly

255
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,960
what they're getting and I think that

256
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,310
that's also an important distinction

257
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,570
between what they can get on the street

258
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,939
between what they can get from any of

259
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,480
our dispensaries but I think we need to

260
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:18,490
rise above this idea of RAC and really

261
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,259
just think of it as we would any other

262
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,970
herbs you know if I had a patient that

263
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:23,350
was using kinko I'm going to use it I

264
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,540
want them to use it in a kind of way I

265
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,460
don't want them to get their medical

266
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:29,379
advice from the 17-year old clerk at the

267
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,740
local GNC I want them to talk to

268
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:42,240
somebody that has an education in this

269
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:42,240
medicine a person's not guided

270
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,819
rather you just tell you if you steal

271
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:58,309
something for because at least twice

272
00:12:52,820 --> 00:13:00,590
though so the follow-up to that question

273
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:02,719
is do you think the Maryland market

274
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:10,490
overall is specifically tailored to

275
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:12,170
medical only yes and based on proper

276
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:16,990
definition of medicine knowing that I've

277
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:16,990
been using his medicine since 1992 yes

278
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,390
somewhere I think the definition

279
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,940
ultimately becomes less meaningful when

280
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:27,350
you see someone come in who hadn't using

281
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,000
it for decades and they finally are able

282
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,090
to really dial it in and whether they

283
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,210
yeah often we don't even know the

284
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:39,050
specificity of all their illnesses but

285
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:42,350
we much of a way that them you probably

286
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:44,839
know this about the some traditional

287
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:48,379
medicine like the pink alloy voiceover

288
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,030
them often cultures have been using

289
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:52,730
medicine for thousands of years and then

290
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:54,470
Big Pharma catches up so what was a

291
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,190
local medicine to people in South and

292
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,649
Central America

293
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,940
now let's become a big Christian or and

294
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,949
lasting than those used for chemotherapy

295
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,510
so I think work we're finally catching

296
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:06,770
up with cannabis so I can expand on that

297
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:10,100
there's a gentleman by the name of James

298
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:11,929
Duke anybody ever gave that name of

299
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,129
course you have your graduating class of

300
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:20,870
either so James Duke has anybody seen

301
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:23,539
that movie medicine man so James Duke is

302
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:26,810
a Howard County native he'd lived right

303
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:28,669
home in Howard County he was on our

304
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:29,119
advisory board until he passed away last

305
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:32,209
year

306
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,379
so James Duke was the one that Sean

307
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:38,900
Connery he Sean Connery played him in

308
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:40,879
medicine man and he would go down into

309
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:43,579
the indigenous regions of the Amazon and

310
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:46,879
find all these herbs and he eventually

311
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:49,700
brought the big pharma companies in they

312
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:52,009
eradicated all the herbs it made modern

313
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,990
medicine and this gentleman who was on

314
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:55,580
our advisory board who live in Howard

315
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,769
County who still has a

316
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,210
garden that represents the eastern

317
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,100
hemisphere the Western Hemisphere has

318
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,960
divided he has every herb there that you

319
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,060
could imagine he's taking people from

320
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,370
McCormick on tours tours of his garden

321
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:09,909
they have never seen herbs grown

322
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:16,070
naturally they've been to his garden

323
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:22,159
this man was remarkable at what he could

324
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:23,240
do with the plant and to see what you

325
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,969
know some of these companies came back

326
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,680
and just eradicated things because he

327
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,430
went down to the Amazon with indigenous

328
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:34,009
people for forever brought things back

329
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:36,979
his stories are amazing and I can't even

330
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:40,580
begin to tell you what about the

331
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,460
audience do you think our market is

332
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:50,900
geared specifically to a medical only

333
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:52,730
market what you're seeing day-to-day

334
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:57,500
what what you experienced I mean

335
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:59,180
whatever from your perspective I'm I'm

336
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,070
not framing the question I'm not

337
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:04,399
qualifying the question I want to see

338
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,590
from your experience it's just I think a

339
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,409
lot of philosophy you're hearing is that

340
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:12,009
anybody can be a patient even within the

341
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:12,009
regulations

342
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:19,700
patience and you know weather anxiety or

343
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:23,389
insomnia or anything any of these things

344
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,520
are on the list of qualifications we're

345
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:27,679
finding at dispensaries that people come

346
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,569
in for a plethora of reasons and they're

347
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,839
qualifying by their doctors by their

348
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:35,240
physicians for many many reasons of why

349
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,240
they're coming in pain comes in many

350
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,730
many forms both mentally and physically

351
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,230
most of the conditions are physical as

352
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:47,539
you know so I think it's serving mostly

353
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,789
as a medical you know but when I hear

354
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:52,789
that I think more regulations are

355
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:55,189
written for more you know medical

356
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:57,949
patients but people are finding

357
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:00,110
alternative medicine is the solution

358
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,660
versus the pharmaceuticals that they've

359
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:05,959
been offered for so many years so in

360
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:07,549
different forms people are slowly as you

361
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,350
know coming in and registering

362
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:11,419
self-certifying themselves to try

363
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:13,250
something new something that may work

364
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:18,259
better for them it's more healthy for

365
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:20,180
them that won't actually kill them we we

366
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:22,849
see it every day at remedy you know the

367
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,709
one of the things that we would say when

368
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:26,539
you're doing it for years like it's not

369
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:30,080
a cliche to say that we're saving lives

370
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:33,379
like we actually have people at our

371
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,899
store at our shop saying you know you're

372
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,460
saving my life you know so it's not for

373
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,590
me to say I'm saving lives it's them

374
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,210
telling us that what they are so I think

375
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:44,029
it's serving the medical market and it's

376
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:47,350
actually you know expanding slowly and

377
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,349
to other people's needs and

378
00:17:56,470 --> 00:19:03,380
but I think this is there has been

379
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:07,250
legislation introduced at least the last

380
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,330
two years in regard to adult use and we

381
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:12,259
get that question a lot of the

382
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:14,389
Commission and I can just respond by

383
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:17,029
saying we are the mirror we are the

384
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:20,710
maryland medical cannabis commission so

385
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:25,730
we have no we have no position and and

386
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:30,019
no comment on adult use but i think it's

387
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:33,370
very well known that medical usually

388
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:35,509
comes first and then states get into

389
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:38,359
authorizing medical use

390
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:40,429
excuse me adult use in a variety of ways

391
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:42,288
i don't know that we have an idea of

392
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:46,309
what that program might look like in

393
00:19:42,288 --> 00:19:53,269
maryland and i think those things are

394
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:56,359
yet to come but from my focus i really

395
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:59,658
want to emphasize and the reason for my

396
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:02,209
questions is we are a medical program we

397
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:05,000
are a health care program for patients

398
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,970
across maryland and i realized that

399
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,308
there are patients that we have now who

400
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:14,630
were not patients before it was legal

401
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:17,389
but they were using this self-medicating

402
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:21,770
it as you will but i think it's up to

403
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:25,130
all of us to really change that persona

404
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:28,369
and sometimes it's it's more difficult

405
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:32,179
with people who have been using cannabis

406
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:34,788
for years have a perspective of you know

407
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:38,240
i need to i need to hide it i you know

408
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:40,308
any i need to to talk about it in a

409
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,159
specific way i need to refer to it in a

410
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:47,720
specific way and it's up to all of us to

411
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:49,700
change that nomenclature those types of

412
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:55,370
things that I can see brought ready to

413
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:57,159
jump it please forgive me if that is the

414
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:59,018
case that violent down have

415
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:05,528
billboards and everything else if we're

416
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:07,450
trying to end the stigma well because I

417
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:08,798
will tell you very honestly and I know

418
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,489
I'm being recorded so I have to be very

419
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:17,079
peaceful the Commission the Commission

420
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:20,710
did propose regulations that did have

421
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:25,749
some strenuous bands in regard to

422
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:28,659
advertising that was in response the in

423
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:31,899
large part to examples that we were

424
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:36,960
provided from licensees that are already

425
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:39,219
out there in the industry who may have

426
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,960
advertised in a way that was not

427
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:46,858
entirely of a medical flavor sir in the

428
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,858
back behind Eric

429
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:59,569
appreciating medical aspect of eternal

430
00:21:56,329 --> 00:22:01,909
death and that homegrown is something

431
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:04,819
that's being considered and adult abuse

432
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:08,300
and that every time that's brought up I

433
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:11,450
encourage people to at the point that it

434
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:14,690
would be amazing if you chose to grow at

435
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,960
home and get tested that you could sell

436
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,809
it to a dispensary and create a

437
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:38,990
legitimate market where people are

438
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:40,519
trading for teachers I'm is the one

439
00:22:38,990 --> 00:23:01,549
coming I'm really interested you said

440
00:22:40,519 --> 00:23:02,990
trading for teachers yeah yeah they're

441
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:05,379
they're creative the market is very

442
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,380
innovative

443
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,140
I can't make a decision for the

444
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:23,259
Commission the Commission did vote on

445
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,720
proposed regulations they offered at

446
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:28,299
least four or five opportunities for

447
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,329
public comment there are proposed

448
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:32,769
regulations that will be submitted

449
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:34,990
through the rulemaking process there is

450
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:38,308
additional opportunities for public

451
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:43,240
comment when it goes through the AEL our

452
00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:46,599
committee I think that we cannot submit

453
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:50,049
those regulations until after the

454
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:52,539
blackout period for the AEL are so they

455
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:55,000
won't even be able to receive them until

456
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:56,740
late February early March that

457
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,170
rulemaking process takes four or five

458
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,329
months so they are not yet in effect

459
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:07,860
they are simply proposed regulations at

460
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:07,859
this point in time dr. Kerr Monta

461
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:17,279
[Music]

462
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:33,169
vii judicial proceedings committee is

463
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:36,730
interested in having discussions with us

464
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:39,220
regarding those proposals I think

465
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,929
they're going to have that opportunity

466
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:48,410
we may end up holding them based on on

467
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:50,300
those those meetings I I won't be

468
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,650
surprised I don't know but I won't be

469
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:55,129
surprised if there is some legislation

470
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:58,220
that's presented this session so who who

471
00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:00,590
knows what comes out of legislation we

472
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:04,880
had House bill 2 last year so that was a

473
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:07,039
whole event enough in and of itself but

474
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,950
I think there is more to come on the

475
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,779
advertising regulations but I was just

476
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,220
explaining the timeline but yes thank

477
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:16,220
you for bringing that up we did give a

478
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,799
briefing to the Senate judicial

479
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:24,130
proceedings committee last week last

480
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:27,230
week yeah and they are very interested

481
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:28,550
in a lot of aspects of cannabis they are

482
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,519
a new committee in the Senate that's

483
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:33,889
hearing it and we were bringing those

484
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,759
new members up to speed on where we are

485
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,759
in the Commission

486
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:07,519
if if there's a bill presented on

487
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,980
advertising there are always our

488
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,900
hearings where people can have an

489
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,289
opportunity to speak you can sign up to

490
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:20,210
speak and offer testimony to the

491
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:23,599
committee I think you know going back to

492
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:27,079
the point of why was the band put out we

493
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:31,459
received a number a great number of

494
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:33,230
examples of advertising that different

495
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:39,319
licensees have been putting out there

496
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:42,250
and you know I can tell you having been

497
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:45,019
in health care for many decades that

498
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:49,069
didn't look like health care advertising

499
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:51,410
to me in some regards so some some is

500
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:54,470
perfectly was perfectly you know

501
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:57,019
acceptable from a health care seeing

502
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:59,480
point but others you know you're kind of

503
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:03,109
scratching your head and going how are

504
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:06,279
they advertising medicine so this is

505
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:09,589
what the commissioners were evaluating

506
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:13,549
when they were deliberating about the

507
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:17,409
new regulations behind Brian the

508
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:17,409
gentleman had his hand up

509
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,049
and everything's everything seems from a

510
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:32,409
legislative standpoint that is

511
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:34,119
reactionary its reactionary to a couple

512
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:37,029
bad billboards a couple of badass but

513
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:39,459
we're all paying the price for it and to

514
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:41,230
just be reactionary because the cup

515
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,110
there's a couple of big seeds out there

516
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,730
it's just the wrong way to do this and

517
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:46,839
we're trying to get rid of the stigma

518
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,240
that's been around forever

519
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,619
a perfect example for me is eighteen

520
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,720
months ago and we were planning our

521
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:54,429
dispensary people said I have friends in

522
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,559
the business and some idea that have

523
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,330
dispensaries that said to me are you

524
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,250
putting armed guards in your Lobby and

525
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:02,259
I'm like armed guards am I having a

526
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,890
party and they thought I was crazy and

527
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:07,509
my answer was I have a ball on my window

528
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:09,700
I'm telling someone I live in a bad day

529
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:11,920
we're gonna mom I'm afraid if I put an

530
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,509
armed guard in my dispensary first of

531
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,519
all I want a gunfight in my dispensary

532
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:17,950
that's the first thing and second of all

533
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,450
I'm not doing anything wrong and it's a

534
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,759
everyone's legal right to phone my

535
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,410
dispensary and get medicine and it's

536
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,750
their legal right that's passed by the

537
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,220
state so why am I going to project this

538
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,200
image I have a Whole Foods down the

539
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,539
store when I met with neighborhood

540
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,890
associations early on draw the money

541
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:34,779
come you know people are going around

542
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:37,110
you I'm like you should walk out of

543
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:39,389
Whole Foods with 300 other groceries

544
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:42,149
every day my average cells going to be

545
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:44,910
95 bucks and like people walk out at

546
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,929
Walgreens with oxycottons all day 800

547
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,210
bucks in their pocket they're not

548
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:50,640
getting robbed so it's this whole stigma

549
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,679
idea that you know we're all trying to

550
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,900
overcome because nobody's doing anything

551
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,850
wrong and when the advertising bands

552
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,140
come and all these other reactionary

553
00:28:56,849 --> 00:29:01,109
regulations come

554
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,179
it just defeats everything everybody in

555
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:06,240
the room is working for and even using

556
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:09,140
the Commission and it's being so

557
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,960
reactionary so damaging to our business

558
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:16,620
we're a retail business like the world

559
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:20,360
that can't you know that's just one

560
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:22,889
issue but I feel like until the

561
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,418
regulators and even the responsible I

562
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:28,230
work in real estate before I did this

563
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:30,570
and people my honest people that come

564
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,009
out are the vocal minority and so the

565
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:33,689
loudest people come out of quite because

566
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:35,940
they saw two billboards they don't like

567
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,460
are the ones screaming there's plenty of

568
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,548
people that aren't offended by

569
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:43,650
advertising any other so if you know we

570
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:46,740
need to fight this essay how I got

571
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:50,100
everyone support in this room know you

572
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,650
know she's nodding and we just neglect

573
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:54,869
this stuff you go on the stigma keeps

574
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,059
going on and we're going to battle for

575
00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:59,219
tomorrow

576
00:29:56,058 --> 00:30:04,379
well I don't disagree with your comments

577
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:08,339
but I do need to say that this is a

578
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:10,020
legal industry in Maryland which is a

579
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:13,740
state that is right next door to

580
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:14,789
Washington DC which the regulators in

581
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:20,190
Washington DC

582
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:22,678
consider this a Schedule one drug and so

583
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:27,298
we have those considerations this is not

584
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:30,179
an approved of federal program like real

585
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:32,789
estate or Whole Foods or anything like

586
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:35,910
that so we have those things that we

587
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:38,759
have to consider as well the regulations

588
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:41,429
and the examples are not based on two

589
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,509
billboards I will tell you it was many

590
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:46,919
many many

591
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:49,169
many many more examples than those than

592
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,609
those two billboards and I actually only

593
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:55,799
can think of one that you might be

594
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:58,098
referring to but so you know we have to

595
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:01,709
keep those things in in perspective

596
00:30:58,098 --> 00:31:04,288
cannabis is available for people who

597
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:08,149
sign up right now we have 80,000

598
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:11,999
patients we registered and we have

599
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:14,908
56,000 that are certified that is less

600
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:19,318
than 1% of the population across

601
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:22,259
Maryland so we have to be respectful and

602
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:24,328
consider all of the state that may be

603
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:27,659
subject to advertising including

604
00:31:24,328 --> 00:31:30,418
children so we have those perspectives

605
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:32,789
as well and it's the job of the

606
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:47,339
Commission to listen to all of the

607
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:49,259
stakeholders in making regulations it's

608
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:51,950
not a personal thing you know I'm just

609
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:53,839
thing I know you have all this

610
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:57,590
I mean I appreciate that and I respect

611
00:31:53,839 --> 00:32:00,139
that and I know that I just think is if

612
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:02,629
we let the stigma keep getting projected

613
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:05,900
through reactions you know we're keep

614
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,070
playing the battle to be called on to

615
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,590
play along

616
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:13,009
I know you have all the regulations and

617
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:16,099
I know it's been too long I know okay

618
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:20,839
Brian you had your hand up I I just

619
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:22,759
wanted to get a sense of how many were a

620
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:25,179
great number and I think you just made

621
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:25,180
that clear

622
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:40,280
got a lot of screenshots I do I think

623
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:44,178
that those were I think those were part

624
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:46,038
of the I thought they were posted but

625
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:47,630
maybe I'm mistaken it was many months

626
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:56,000
ago that we went through all that so I

627
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:58,669
can't remember okay I think what Brian

628
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,579
is Lou into is that if given the

629
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:07,100
opportunity we would sell police if

630
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:09,168
there were examples of that we as an

631
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:12,339
industry were concerned about that a

632
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:16,159
more reasonable response would be let's

633
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:18,019
let out let's let's set out the rules of

634
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,090
what is acceptable and what is and

635
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:21,619
instead of saying you can't talk about

636
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:24,819
this which is basically what the

637
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:24,819
recommendation seems

638
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:44,119
I'm just wondering what health care

639
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:46,490
looks like to you because you're saying

640
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:48,799
that certain things don't look like

641
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,450
health care standards to you but you're

642
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,609
also talking about the difference

643
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,410
between recreational and medical and the

644
00:33:52,609 --> 00:34:00,709
same stuff where you have a medical

645
00:33:54,410 --> 00:34:03,650
industry I'm wondering just what do you

646
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:07,519
expect this industry because for me I

647
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:30,050
don't think it's pill oh I don't think

648
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:31,668
it's pills either I'm not a decision

649
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:48,590
maker so I don't get a vote

650
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:50,750
I'm you know I think that and this is me

651
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,030
personally again I'm not a commissioner

652
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:57,139
and I don't get a vote I think it is

653
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:59,630
entirely fine for people to say I am a

654
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,969
medical cannabis business and here's my

655
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:05,240
location and here's my website and

656
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:08,480
here's how you find me I think that's

657
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:12,809
perfectly fine so for example there is a

658
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,369
growing on 95 that has a billboard

659
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:17,409
and that's all it says that's literally

660
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:19,690
all that it says I can only offer you my

661
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:21,489
personal opinion I'm not speaking as the

662
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:28,210
executive director of the cannabis

663
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:51,189
Commission okay one more question and

664
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:53,110
then we're gonna know that the

665
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:55,179
regulations on advertising address

666
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:58,630
pricing at all we do not have any

667
00:35:55,179 --> 00:36:00,669
authority to regulate pricing markets in

668
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:15,940
Maryland other than the regulations say

669
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:17,230
you may not give away samples I I'm not

670
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:28,510
sure where your questions coming from

671
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:32,619
but I don't think the proposed

672
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:41,970
regulations address headed off so the

673
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:41,969
next topic we just finished out 2018

674
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:50,849
first year 13 months of working in

675
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:53,099
Maryland obviously a tremendous year

676
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:58,329
tell me what was the biggest surprise

677
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:59,500
that came out of 2018 for you that I

678
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:01,690
finally got a job in the industry

679
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:08,619
everyone probably hungry

680
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:10,659
I think I echo this for everybody the

681
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:19,449
way that a canvas year is ten years on

682
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:21,670
your life so the work is extremely hard

683
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:23,679
people think that cannabis business is

684
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:26,680
oh you're gonna surround smoked cannabis

685
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:30,489
and tell jokes no it's a lot more than

686
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:32,619
that dealing with patients ISM is a

687
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:35,169
responsibility that everybody in this

688
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:39,099
room knows and welcomes and it doesn't

689
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:41,500
come to those that don't have great and

690
00:37:39,099 --> 00:38:01,960
I'll leave it at that okay other

691
00:37:41,500 --> 00:38:12,789
surprises from our first year standing I

692
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:15,309
mean I think to get here but I think we

693
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:17,440
did it right and I think you know the

694
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:19,929
testing and all that is great and things

695
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,750
affect we become the terpene profiles

696
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:25,969
and things to do it's a testament

697
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,789
the fact that we have a limited number

698
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:33,250
of licenses allow people to spend a lot

699
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:33,250
of money these and few things right so

700
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:38,210
joy I have a question I'm going to flip

701
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:39,619
it what's the biggest surprise from the

702
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:52,550
Commission perspect all those laughs

703
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:53,569
here how do I pick only one ah I can

704
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:58,820
tell you one of the things I'm most

705
00:38:53,570 --> 00:39:02,750
pleased with and it it is a little bit

706
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:04,700
of a surprise when I started at

707
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:09,440
Commission Li at 17 employees we now

708
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:12,559
have almost 40 and I think we have some

709
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,440
of the best talent and the most

710
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,539
committed employees that I have ever had

711
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,679
the honor to work with and I am so proud

712
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:23,300
of the work that my team has done the

713
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:27,049
projects that were brought out to us in

714
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:29,720
House bill 2 were enormous and we ended

715
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:32,530
up having to hire about six people just

716
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:37,699
to work on the House bill two projects

717
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:40,490
they did a tremendous job just just

718
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:44,449
great talent and very very committed

719
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:47,989
people to the quality of product across

720
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:53,710
Maryland so there was a gentleman over

721
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:53,709
here in the bulkhead Richard Richard

722
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:00,539
[Music]

723
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:32,599
[Music]

724
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:10,200
well as you know dispensaries were

725
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:13,889
awarded based on senatorial district 2

726
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:17,219
for senatorial district or a grower or

727
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:21,239
and a grower could have the opportunity

728
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:24,589
to apply for dispensary for any district

729
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:27,989
that they chose eight of the growers

730
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:33,120
took advantage of that and so the

731
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:35,939
Commission in 2016 no yes

732
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,900
2016 awarded a hundred and two

733
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:42,720
pre-approved dispensaries those hundred

734
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,789
and two are either licensed 71 of them

735
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,279
are licensed or the remaining 31 are

736
00:41:44,789 --> 00:41:50,059
still in that pre-approval stage the

737
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,840
list hasn't changed it's still the same

738
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:53,840
licensees that were awarded

739
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:01,110
yeah you're absolutely right and eight

740
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:05,579
of you who actually met the deadline

741
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:05,579
only eight dispensaries met the deadline

742
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,690
well there were eight open on December

743
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:34,480
1st so there could have been a few more

744
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:36,369
license part okay so well we continue to

745
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,340
meet with those individual dispensaries

746
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:42,630
and I will tell you that I met with a

747
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:58,950
dispensary two weeks ago and they just

748
00:42:42,630 --> 00:43:02,920
received their zoning permit in May of

749
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:04,869
18 we required every dispensary that was

750
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,300
not licensed to come and meet with the

751
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:08,619
Commission and explained to us and

752
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:11,620
several of you may have been in those

753
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:15,219
meetings explain to us the efforts that

754
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:17,889
you have been undertaking to become

755
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:19,629
licensed we have to deal with them

756
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:21,819
individually because we know there are

757
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,400
cannabis friendly areas and there are

758
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:27,370
cannabis unfriendly areas there are a

759
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,940
lot of zoning boards that took liberties

760
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:34,019
and changing rules and things like that

761
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:37,000
depending on the areas that you were in

762
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:38,530
every one of you knew going into this

763
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,090
there were going to be a hundred and two

764
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:46,360
dispensaries you have had the luxury if

765
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:49,289
you will of a non competitive market up

766
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,289
until this time

767
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:58,619
well I appreciate that because patients

768
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:01,559
need to have dispensaries that are open

769
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:03,859
but the original intent always was to

770
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:06,630
dispensaries per senatorial district

771
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:19,410
that has not changed there's been no

772
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:22,440
changes in the program the Commission

773
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:25,519
has not made any discussion or decision

774
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:29,780
on resending any dispensary licenses

775
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:32,519
they I can tell you they have all put

776
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:35,280
thank you they have all put efforts and

777
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:37,860
energy into becoming open even though

778
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,960
they're behind the time my last question

779
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:45,690
is I'd like to hear one suggestion for

780
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,780
improvement and one item or story of

781
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:52,559
success and what a successful fight to

782
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:55,530
you okay bourbon more question how can

783
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,409
we help get the more than 50% of the

784
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:00,330
market that's now thank you to get

785
00:44:57,409 --> 00:45:03,179
certified how can we help you make that

786
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:05,099
go faster because basically you know

787
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:06,989
30,000 beat whatever suffering and

788
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:08,489
waiting to get their cards and event

789
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:15,269
employees it's been more than two months

790
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:17,069
so it feels like employees for two

791
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:18,900
months believe in the please applied for

792
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,980
their cards their medical cannabis cards

793
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,170
and they're still waiting after two

794
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,659
months so they're also potential clients

795
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,450
are you talking about the completed

796
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:30,929
cards the age of registration

797
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:32,969
factorization okay more than 50% of our

798
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:33,929
market now sitting in the queue can

799
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:36,089
purchase

800
00:45:33,929 --> 00:45:39,199
okay I've seen seems like that lag is

801
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,200
getting longer rather than sure

802
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,920
this massive work flow that's the wonder

803
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:47,879
if there's any way we can help her help

804
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,278
you know lubricate the process is there

805
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:55,680
any automated solution versus throwing

806
00:45:50,278 --> 00:45:58,259
people at the problem not an easy one

807
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,899
that fast one no there's a period I'm

808
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:03,449
working on the automation piece but

809
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,970
that's not going to help us today or

810
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:07,978
tomorrow or next week this makes us be

811
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:09,449
paired up with it's not the same product

812
00:46:07,978 --> 00:46:11,818
I don't look for if you apply for a

813
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:13,469
handgun permit to purchase a gun in

814
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:14,940
Maryland they give you a flipper and a

815
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:16,679
preliminary approval after about a week

816
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,749
and then do the real background check

817
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:22,498
that's deeper after that so if you

818
00:46:18,748 --> 00:46:25,038
consider cannabis less harm harmful than

819
00:46:22,498 --> 00:46:27,988
gums so I think it might be a model that

820
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:29,099
look at discus to keep people waiting

821
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:30,420
for months and months when they're

822
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:47,369
suffering and it so many times been

823
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:50,039
suffering for decades the pending bucket

824
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:54,028
is divided among many different

825
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:55,549
situations one of the situations is we

826
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:57,599
haven't been able to touch the

827
00:46:55,548 --> 00:46:59,639
registration yet the applications been

828
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,599
put in we we haven't been able to get to

829
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:05,400
it the other bucket is we needed to send

830
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,619
it back for some reason usually in a

831
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,278
photo that's the biggest problem is the

832
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:13,200
photo the other is they've received

833
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:15,179
their registration from us but they

834
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:19,739
haven't gone to a certifying provider

835
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:23,308
and then there is another bucket that I

836
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:25,380
think we are remedying with a new

837
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:29,099
process is there's a bucket where people

838
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:32,519
just apply and they never intended to do

839
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:34,680
anything with the program because of the

840
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:38,998
fact that people could register without

841
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:41,759
a cost they would just sign up what we

842
00:47:38,998 --> 00:47:46,078
have seen prior to implementing the new

843
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:47,500
card ID program we were getting 320 to

844
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,350
350 new applications

845
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:53,349
today 300 and 350 average about 320

846
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:55,900
since we implemented the $50 card fee

847
00:47:53,349 --> 00:48:00,610
paid at the time of registration we're

848
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:03,220
at 200 a day so serious serious people

849
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:05,590
are now registering for the program and

850
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:10,409
it's going to help us clear out that Q

851
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:12,430
so the the pending queue is not all

852
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:14,529
registrations that we haven't been able

853
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:16,299
to get to some of them are some are

854
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:18,370
patients who need to go get certified

855
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:37,990
some are patients who need to get us

856
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:41,799
back information I can't I I don't work

857
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:44,109
that desk I don't I think in from from

858
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,080
my perspective is the is the photo

859
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:49,870
subjective or is there an automated

860
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:51,719
something behind it or is it and at a

861
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:54,400
desk looking at a computer screen

862
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:57,730
there's criteria about what that photo

863
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:01,210
needs to meet and there are individual

864
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:04,500
agents looking at the photo if you've

865
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,500
already got a driver's license

866
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:23,769
[Music]

867
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:37,230
we don't get answers or call back where

868
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:40,860
there's stuff coming in and I thought

869
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:43,740
think what I was originally told by the

870
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:47,430
Commission was once somebody is in the

871
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:49,949
registry because that is already like a

872
00:49:47,429 --> 00:49:51,480
list then those people are going to get

873
00:49:49,949 --> 00:49:54,839
pushed in the front of the line but I

874
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:57,539
have had a lot of issues with hospice

875
00:49:54,840 --> 00:50:10,400
patients and having them have submitted

876
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:12,929
but not getting believe it if a patient

877
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,880
indicates on their application that they

878
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:30,719
are registered hospice patient they do

879
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:33,030
not wait in the queue that's why we

880
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:35,579
don't make them wait we do not have that

881
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:37,769
it's my understanding I'm not aware we

882
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:40,529
have access to the hospice registry it

883
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:49,590
is when a patient applies they tell us

884
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:52,410
they are in the hospice program I would

885
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:55,430
think access to the hospice registry

886
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:55,429
would be a HIPAA issue

887
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,479
[Applause]

888
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:16,989
if you have particular patience I'll be

889
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:16,989
glad to follow up on them what's that

890
00:51:24,759 --> 00:51:33,068
well if if we know that they're hospice

891
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:33,068
patients we process them right away

892
00:51:35,438 --> 00:51:40,009
how's that doing it on that on the

893
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:43,009
registration I haven't is there a filter

894
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:44,838
on them I'll have to ask this I don't

895
00:51:43,009 --> 00:51:47,438
know what I'm asking because I see the

896
00:51:44,838 --> 00:52:07,489
frustration on this young lady's face

897
00:51:47,438 --> 00:52:09,098
there's a bottom line here but I will

898
00:52:07,489 --> 00:52:11,749
check and see I got a new number today

899
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:16,699
again the pending hospice will be in the

900
00:52:11,748 --> 00:52:18,558
same this the same circumstance except

901
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:21,650
we do not require a photo from a hospice

902
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,298
patient but if they have been registered

903
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:26,630
and have not got gotten certified

904
00:52:23,298 --> 00:52:29,358
they're still in pending if we've asked

905
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:30,920
them for proof of residency or some

906
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:32,869
other information and they haven't got

907
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:38,420
that back to us yet they'll still be in

908
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:39,679
the pending I'm not aware I'll have to

909
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:42,199
check my numbers and when I get on my

910
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:45,309
phone so I can see today's numbers so I

911
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:45,309
got a report this morning

912
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:52,849
