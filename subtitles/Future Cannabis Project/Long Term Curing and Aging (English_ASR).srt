1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,839
we see the same thing with hashes too

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:06,539
like Nepalese ball hash if you do a nice

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,679
Nepalese hash a temple ball you know

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,059
that you're gonna get different

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,709
cannabinoids in there I know Frenchy

6
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:12,718
cannolis talk about you're seeing you're

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,910
seeing terpenoids coming out of Nepalese

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,100
hash balls that you're not going to see

9
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,170
in fresh flour and you're gonna get a

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,970
you know a little bit of CBN degradation

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,100
in there but if you do a nice long slow

12
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:26,219
Cure you know it's just you get that

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,019
much rounder whole plant feel you know I

14
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,759
used to live in the Caribbean for a long

15
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:30,778
time and we'd notice that almost all the

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,210
bud that would come out of the Virgin

17
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,950
Islands it would be a golden brown color

18
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,899
and a lot of that's because they don't

19
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,489
have indoor spaces to cure so they're

20
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,230
curing in the Sun because if you're

21
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:41,759
curing in the shade or in the jungle or

22
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:43,289
the bush where you're growing it you're

23
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,119
gonna get a lot of rot and mold and

24
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:46,378
things like that the whole cure concept

25
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,329
is amazing and the way the degradation

26
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,269
and the color changes and you see this

27
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,558
in dispensaries all the time now that

28
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,120
the stuff that's a little golden there

29
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,269
are little amber is just sitting on the

30
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,339
Shelf all this bright green neon stuff

31
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,420
is flying out the door and people aren't

32
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,600
realizing think about cigars think about

33
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,269
the high-end whiskeys think about how

34
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,839
you're developing phenols in curing and

35
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:15,090
in transferring tannins and that's

36
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,189
really the crux of the issue you start

37
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,939
changing these chlorophylls all over the

38
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:22,109
tannins it's amazing you see all this

39
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:26,699
weed coming out of South Florida that

40
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:29,549
was cured in the traditional tobacco

41
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,829
ways with the Spanish cedar and you see

42
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,229
the phenols completely change the

43
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:37,679
terpene profile when it goes in after

44
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:39,629
curing in 28 to 30 days in the Spanish

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,460
cedar it just completely changes

46
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,158
everything especially of the Haze's and

47
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,959
the you know more rootsy spicy strains

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,850
really just develop in that environment

49
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,679
oh yeah when with the tobacco model

50
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:51,719
there's a cigar now that's I think it's

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,329
like $10,000 for these the box of these

52
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,819
cigars but it's a 15 year old tobacco

53
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:57,389
that they've been aging in these special

54
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:59,548
humidors

55
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,170
and with tobacco it requires a much

56
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,939
higher humidity content they're gonna

57
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,469
they want to be in a room with like a 70

58
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,298
percent relative humidity to keep it

59
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:07,649
right and with cannabis especially in

60
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,479
curing we want to keep it down around in

61
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,949
the 50 range you know you don't want to

62
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,660
have too much moisture in there because

63
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,708
you know you can get pathogens and in

64
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:13,900
the curing process you have to worry

65
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,060
about

66
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,709
Aspergillus and other things like that

67
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,610
so you really need to keep your room

68
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:23,170
stable and you know keep the humidity

69
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,450
just perfect and the temperature in a

70
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:28,089
certain range and you want to keep lots

71
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:29,318
of air flow going through and just take

72
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,030
your time with it you know it's it's

73
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:32,589
amazing people are just in such a rush

74
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,209
to get things out the door and you find

75
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,920
that you know some of our favorite

76
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:37,628
things we have I'm trying to remember

77
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,429
the name is what was it at and push or

78
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:40,688
something that's was it the tanjur we

79
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,329
had one that's a three at we've been

80
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:45,669
curing which one yeah the tan is cush

81
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:49,180
we've cured it for three years and it

82
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:52,298
has drastically change in nose in flavor

83
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,849
in every single way and it's just such a

84
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:58,569
happy flower to smoke it's just like you

85
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,608
know velvet going in yeah it's so funny

86
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:01,988
to me how many of the same concepts that

87
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:04,239
we all have been focusing on and

88
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,639
developing for 20 or 30 years for

89
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,219
cannabis are so the same processes and

90
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,469
concepts executed in different ways for

91
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:13,299
soil building like you know you talk

92
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:15,908
about these temperature ranges and time

93
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:18,699
we have to think about those same exact

94
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:21,789
things for composting and for aging our

95
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:23,019
forest products we use redwood and in

96
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:25,060
our soil because we're up in Humboldt

97
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:28,030
it's a byproduct of existing industry

98
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,340
that was being wasted and so we use it

99
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,489
in a very specific way compost it in a

100
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,469
way to build all of the microbiology

101
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,329
correctly it requires intense

102
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:38,949
temperature monitoring where we have to

103
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,650
let it hit a certain temperature and

104
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:43,120
roll it and then let it build back up to

105
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,319
these temperatures and you got to be

106
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,280
meticulous you got to pay attention

107
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:50,318
you've got a test you've got to look at

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,669
the whole picture and if you're not

109
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,608
paying attention it's going to get away

110
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:56,919
from you and that's where the experience

111
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,449
comes in for curing is so many people

112
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:01,659
who are new to the industry don't even

113
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:03,430
see the concept as existing and that's

114
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,500
why they can't execute it well and

115
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,239
there's the the the depth of each of

116
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,739
those things with the cannabis you have

117
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,359
all the different cannabinoids you have

118
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,310
the terpenoid so you have every little

119
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:14,859
bit of it that you need all those parts

120
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,228
THC is THC is THC it's a single note

121
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,970
it's gonna you know affect your cb1

122
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:21,189
receptors it's going to trigger that hi

123
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,729
and you know you can get the most

124
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:26,680
refined oil that is 90% THC and that's

125
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:27,459
fine but in that flower you're gonna

126
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,019
bring into

127
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:31,269
maturation all of the other parts of the

128
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,829
plant all the oils and the the aromatics

129
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:34,149
and and really bringing it the same

130
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:35,709
thing with the soil you need the micro

131
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,269
arising you need the beneficials you

132
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:39,399
need the bacteria you need the fun you

133
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:42,418
need every single bit it's not dirt dirt

134
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,418
is dead soil is alive
