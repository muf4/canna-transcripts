[Music]

2
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:17,820
have made further forces Michael our

3
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,480
message would be our message will be to

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,510
endure

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,868
kofi from Java if you don't have the

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,449
exact world that define that exactly

7
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:30,420
profile that pain that you that you want

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,929
of seiga or why not eat cheese or

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,730
anything that the birth test that is

10
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:42,149
degree stative you need a vocabulary to

11
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:44,189
think to to to distinguish and with

12
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,899
cannabis even more so because there is

13
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:51,238
so much inner city into it like grapes

14
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,920
you know there's how many different

15
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:57,589
kinds of those are you to know there is

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,660
thousands and thousands and thousands of

17
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:03,750
of you of cannabis creative that what

18
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:07,140
complicated little bit the basic to our

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,540
story it's simple we don't even have to

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,409
prove that we have a cannabis day while

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:18,710
it's over now it's when you you are

22
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:23,490
devious the diversity of cannabis to the

23
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:27,298
firstly to zero to two - what horizontal

24
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:29,280
tell it bring it to to another limit to

25
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,939
another dimension you did with cannabis

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:37,259
anyway so it's no bigger than any single

27
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:40,798
already it's gonna be imitation per se

28
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:44,340
it's just much bigger territory to

29
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,950
create a lot of different happen for

30
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,439
file you know what I mean so it's like

31
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:52,170
yes we should small stick to the basic

32
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,559
it's like the deposition the lesion it's

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,740
something it's dedicated to create

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,500
quality only that's is the one name of

35
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:04,349
the game is that so we should stick to

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,629
all the song down that create quality

37
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:09,090
stuffing I never really thought about it

38
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:12,120
but the my copy in your soul I guess

39
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,219
that would be the number one stage you

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,379
I mean knowing your swords a plan to

41
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:20,219
take from your from your soul and what

42
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:22,530
define that specific characteristic of

43
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,530
the place where he goes the taste of

44
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,719
that specific place that's the value of

45
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:33,959
the small of small farming and terror

46
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:36,419
definitely is the precise mix of the

47
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,430
nutrients that are being taken up by the

48
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:41,309
plant and how the planet is dispersing

49
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,010
that in its body and that's what gives

50
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,789
that unique flavor different cultivate

51
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:50,128
yeah but not chase the cannabis for a

52
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:53,340
vision it's like the way of a beach

53
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:57,539
because in function of T WA the lawns

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,140
the crime and the couch Eva and and the

55
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:03,469
summer the community that creates that

56
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:07,018
quality but you have also the terroir a

57
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:09,689
testings that they were and in that case

58
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,239
it has always been a big debate because

59
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:15,269
it's never been proven that the grape

60
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,759
actually capture the characteristic of

61
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,980
the place now is the study on my home

62
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,649
they theorize that it's actually the

63
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:25,168
microbial life that change from that

64
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,200
specific piece of lung to that also side

65
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,989
of the of the track and this is what

66
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:34,348
brings us different characteristic to

67
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:38,189
the to the one it's not a plant it's a

68
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:42,899
life in the circle that do everything so

69
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:44,370
I like schedules there's communities in

70
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,199
the soil right and how are the

71
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,250
communities in the soil translating into

72
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:53,489
communities above-ground cannabis

73
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,639
because it uses step and to all every

74
00:03:53,489 --> 00:04:00,329
single both ground then the specificity

75
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,519
of the of the climate as sex life is

76
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,829
going to bring certain aspect of a

77
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,590
profile that you're not going to get on

78
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:10,590
the other side of the valley or

79
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,150
or in any other is the unusual places in

80
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:17,629
a in a world so it's like you have that

81
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,908
as much as you get the tape and from

82
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:24,839
also all that mutual that the plant

83
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:25,389
absorbs ooh step ends and the plot mix

84
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:30,709
them

85
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:34,610
depending on that above-ground necessity

86
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:38,779
basically so I want to see if this

87
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:41,419
metaphor holds up all of these little

88
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:45,619
puzzle pieces is like a pixelated

89
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:49,279
picture that by themselves they're part

90
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:53,240
of it but only all working together do

91
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,939
you see what's really going on yeah I

92
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,650
think that's a good metaphor and it's

93
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:00,529
certainly in the world of science being

94
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:03,250
very reductionistic they want to take

95
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:06,888
each little pixel and study that very

96
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:09,079
very finely and they get lost in that

97
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,509
reductionism they forget that they've

98
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:15,199
got to put all the pieces in the puzzle

99
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:17,779
back together to see that overall

100
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:30,259
pattern and then you realize that this

101
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:33,049
is just one tiny little pixel and like

102
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:35,029
any four four people you know how is it

103
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,319
how's the the clay the communities in

104
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:37,549
the soil gonna affect the communities

105
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,110
and as people

106
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:46,100
well that's nutrients know about getting

107
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,689
in food who's helped of the most which

108
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,710
communities around the world not just

109
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:58,310
here in America when you take into

110
00:05:51,709 --> 00:06:01,129
account the soil food web it's well you

111
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,949
know when what can we influence which

112
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:06,110
group of people communities which

113
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:10,370
cultures are most receptive to learning

114
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:12,860
just how to do it the natural way yeah

115
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,840
where did yeah it's the poorest

116
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,479
countries in the world or where the

117
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:19,788
biggest effect can can occur most

118
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:22,490
rapidly right because you've got to send

119
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:26,709
somebody there to get them to understand

120
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:29,389
the the simple measures whereas in

121
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:31,449
industrialized nations we've got to have

122
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,490
big equipment we've got you know a

123
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:37,180
thousand acre farms or ten thousand

124
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:41,319
hectare farms or something like that and

125
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,910
and that's hard to change is not good

126
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,839
for the planet they just don't get it

127
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:50,590
like you can you can do big space

128
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:53,439
but you have to cut down that big space

129
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:55,869
into chunk and especially in nature

130
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,120
chunks that poor not producers and

131
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:02,709
project because our sake life the world

132
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:05,560
life web of the planet is made of

133
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:08,620
diversity and we fucking scale of

134
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,899
diversity is like it's like you want to

135
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:15,550
create GMO tomato to make to me to

136
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:18,909
resist our heat place the tomato was

137
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:22,810
bloody born in the desert okay so we

138
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:24,910
don't have another planet some genetics

139
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,399
that could do exactly and better

140
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:31,439
whatever you want to do is like it's

141
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:34,289
crazy so it's like it's that fear of

142
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:38,740
diversity and wanting to corner that

143
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:41,680
specific aspect of whatever because we

144
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,860
fancy it better the reason why we do GMO

145
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,689
and in the conventional world is because

146
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,120
we want everything to become right now

147
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:51,189
on exactly the same day is that the most

148
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,009
important thing about your food is that

149
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:56,920
it became there was all pickable at the

150
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:59,949
same time on the same day it's the wrong

151
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,900
thing to be emphasizing I mean they

152
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:04,750
don't really a future you need to create

153
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:07,929
plants that can work that can go on

154
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,329
poison if you want to grow a plant or

155
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,040
you have to clean the soil to be able to

156
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:16,300
go and then Ziploc there is only two

157
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:27,160
choices on and I mean I don't know it

158
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:28,389
sounds very simple when you say there's

159
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,750
only two choices

160
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:34,600
yeah working 100% with a healthy

161
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:40,299
ecosystem which takes care of the plant

162
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:43,360
for you or growing it and poison I mean

163
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:46,459
that's where we stole them is that where

164
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,889
you still do industrial version

165
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,649
you have to grow it in poison to control

166
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:54,620
every single little process yeah to

167
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:57,169
death and the fact is if we get the

168
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,970
proper biology in the soil we can

169
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:01,849
achieve the same end which is to get

170
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:05,120
everything becoming ripe on the same day

171
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:08,240
and harvest it just the way that

172
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,629
chemical companies wanna be able to

173
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,100
manage all of their their growth we can

174
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:16,309
do the same thing but you have to

175
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:22,009
understand all the bits and pieces and I

176
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:25,819
have a picture puzzle yeah executors

177
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:28,399
yeah it's Fabio casting falsehood

178
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,890
because we have we have a connection

179
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,669
with our family of therma of small my

180
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:36,528
mom she never bought in our life

181
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:39,409
anything but at the farmer down the

182
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:41,990
street every usual day of your life and

183
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:45,319
my go home as the same Zeus famine

184
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:48,889
during World War two not only they were

185
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,650
going food for France but they were

186
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:56,088
risking their life to bring that in

187
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:59,208
inner city they have a lot of power the

188
00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:02,839
farmer they are protected like national

189
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:04,759
treasure there is nothing that come in a

190
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,880
country that can compete with the

191
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:10,039
quality and the price that are old by

192
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,980
the French government and the farmer is

193
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:16,519
a because if they go on or if they go

194
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,459
and on strike there is nothing that move

195
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:22,458
in France ever until you give it to them

196
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:25,458
so it's like that that pause that

197
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:28,458
relation with people you don't have it

198
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:31,028
here there is like there is respect for

199
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:33,919
farming there is a better understanding

200
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:36,740
that your kawatte is actually growing in

201
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:40,819
soil literally this like most people

202
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:43,579
have no relation with that part of of

203
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,010
the food chain because here it's not

204
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:50,689
food it's business you know and I mean

205
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:53,958
it's like food it's not something super

206
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,209
importing food in in Europe sharing

207
00:10:53,958 --> 00:11:00,159
water or on the Mediterranean Sea

208
00:10:56,208 --> 00:11:02,739
it's a give the Gators hospitality just

209
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,939
that you can give it's like food is

210
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:09,339
everything and now we just see it as a

211
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:13,420
necessity is a reason there is nothing

212
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:17,170
behind but its business when a commodity

213
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:20,289
exactly the word I was I am much more

214
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:22,240
than that it's like all MCS is dependent

215
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:25,719
you are what you eat and we are eating

216
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:30,100
poison and they want to make it worse by

217
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:32,110
creating GMO monster when you can just

218
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,659
clean the place and it's like you say

219
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,480
it's not that difficult to clean the

220
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:39,669
place you just need to dedicate as there

221
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:45,278
is so much organic matter that we can

222
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:47,289
take care of we we I mean it's like we

223
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,259
are responsible because there is there

224
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:52,539
is a huge responsibility behind being in

225
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:54,789
a cannabis and you see where you are

226
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:57,990
supposed to save the planet and then you

227
00:11:54,789 --> 00:12:01,599
go in Colorados extract only CBD from

228
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:04,000
from plant and this was I'm stuck in a

229
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,850
let it rot in you don't even do paper

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,039
with it like seriously CBD is a

231
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,319
by-product is the icing on the cake that

232
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,750
prout has been bleeded for tens of

233
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:17,909
thousands of years to make fiber and

234
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,909
seeds and that you just go away okay

235
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:26,649
it's like there is the money people they

236
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,810
don't see what you can do with with an

237
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:31,089
fiber it's like it's not only you can

238
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:34,028
change the face of the planet but the

239
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:36,490
guy who is gonna put out biodegradable

240
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:38,528
plastic bag on the table it is going to

241
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,370
eat it seriously you want a jackpot you

242
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:42,250
want money

243
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:44,799
Doozers bag Doozers hotel-dieu or

244
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:48,879
everything that we is made of paid whole

245
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:51,099
like it would give us some bricks that

246
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:54,429
are that are fireproof we really need it

247
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,230
in California there is like so much to

248
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:59,528
do with it and at the same time you

249
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:03,100
clean the ground and is like it's a it's

250
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:06,250
a you teammate power that give us the

251
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:09,129
ability to go into the 21st century and

252
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:13,309
finally new source of

253
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:17,929
of energy that that doesn't compromise

254
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:19,599
life on those many traditional cultures

255
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:27,289
that I've experienced around the world

256
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:30,709
the farmer is at the same cultural level

257
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:33,139
in the community as the best hunter or

258
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:35,419
the best fisherman because it's really

259
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:39,019
about meeting the community's needs and

260
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:41,689
the farmer is the one when the animals

261
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:48,909
aren't there plants are really hard to

262
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:51,589
run away from we have managed to

263
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:55,219
denigrate the role of the farmer most

264
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:57,620
don't farmers is being stupid and not

265
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,379
really knowing but part of it is that

266
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,409
instead of them managing their own land

267
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:07,578
and them managing the plant and getting

268
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:11,088
the best they just call up fertilizer

269
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:13,009
agents and that fertilizer person tells

270
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,050
them what to do you need to go out and

271
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:17,269
put out three tons of line and half a

272
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:19,129
ton of gypsum on your land and then a

273
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:20,659
week later what am I supposed to do from

274
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:22,789
the farmer well you're supposed to go

275
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:24,919
out and you put on ammonium nitrate or

276
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:27,559
you put out urea the next week it's

277
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:31,338
something else something else and that

278
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:34,549
farmer has released the responsibility

279
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:38,480
they are just slaves if you will they're

280
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:40,269
their serfs to the chemical companies

281
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,409
you're being told what to do basically

282
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:45,019
yeah they're not thinking they're not

283
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:49,448
participating in this they're just the

284
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:52,100
worker and we've farmers that actually

285
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:56,379
understand and know what they're doing

286
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:59,269
and small farms are much better for

287
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:00,828
having people really know what's going

288
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,870
on in their soil what's going on with

289
00:15:00,828 --> 00:15:05,088
their plans you have a thousand hectares

290
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,669
you a thousand acres how can you keep

291
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:09,500
track of everything so I really like the

292
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:13,578
European model much better where the

293
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:16,970
farms are small when you look where when

294
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:19,429
I look at the space you are here it's

295
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,540
really hard to sink small farm yeah I

296
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:23,949
mean you don't

297
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:26,649
but at the same point why they don't

298
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:28,750
understand is monoculture is like when I

299
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:32,199
learned that you have to move your be

300
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:34,779
from A to Z to a grantor C order or

301
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:38,290
elder country to be able to have put in

302
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:41,049
is yes I mean if you're if you're a

303
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:43,269
farmer and you don't have this you don't

304
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:45,159
have Polly nation is like a man is like

305
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:51,730
and you're not slipping out of your

306
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:54,309
shoes no seeds no so it's a greedy

307
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:58,420
reaching a point of no heat down here

308
00:15:54,309 --> 00:16:02,500
like that's that's Kelly ceilings and as

309
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:06,879
the world poor economic power that stone

310
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:09,730
behind Kennedy's as to be used to to

311
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:12,189
challenge that so it's like for us it's

312
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:15,399
not like I mean I'm cool I don't want to

313
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:18,190
make money I'm just dude literally a

314
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,319
giveaway and stuff yeah it's nice take

315
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,960
care of people but fucking make money

316
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,650
because if we have money it's a tool

317
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,810
that you have a money you can do stuff

318
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:30,009
okay the moment you have the bigger

319
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:33,339
stuff you can do

320
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:35,110
well he's so much stuff to do that it

321
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:38,110
would be cool that people with the

322
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,519
certain level of consciousness and the

323
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,810
blade to make it happen

324
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:46,750
and take care of the community yeah

325
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:50,769
because it's you know 2d to define the

326
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:53,350
terroir there is six science one is the

327
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:56,470
science of soil which is to science at

328
00:16:53,350 --> 00:17:00,100
the same time everything else it's all

329
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:03,190
the community it's more it's beyond an

330
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:07,449
actual farmer it's more than the

331
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:10,088
community of the observation and so I

332
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:12,519
couldn't meet that change that specific

333
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:18,069
place and stuff so I just heard him say

334
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:20,039
that there's the soil community and then

335
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:23,259
there's the rest of the community

336
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:25,059
because it's all community and now what

337
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:27,789
we're doing is even bridging the gap

338
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:31,599
between the soil community and the rest

339
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:34,779
of the community you know I think it's

340
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:38,319
so it's business community so

341
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:41,849
is that an odd yes

342
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:44,980
but it's obscene that or ancestor of

343
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:48,189
ancestor knew that I mean it's like Oh

344
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,329
grandparents a the knew how to keep the

345
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:55,570
sole factor doing not that much and

346
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:58,539
producing a lot so it like it's now we

347
00:17:55,569 --> 00:18:03,069
have the science to show what our Valley

348
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:07,539
tradition are basically and this is

349
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:11,289
important because it you need this to

350
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:14,399
validate anything in in the 21st century

351
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:18,670
basically otherwise it's just like

352
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,830
bullshit of old people crazy P all that

353
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:24,070
type of stuff now and you can put the

354
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:27,159
number and show that we shed you're

355
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:31,509
doing this you do you produce such a

356
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,910
such a such a ripple in in the life web

357
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:40,960
and that's why you shouldn't do it when

358
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:43,269
it's only vocal Oh hard knowledge that

359
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,130
is passed down it's something that you

360
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:49,000
have to be into it to believe now you

361
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:51,880
can you can tell everybody here that has

362
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,759
been better using bullshit pushed by

363
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,920
your by companies look it's simple

364
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,869
you're making a mistake because this is

365
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,539
this and this and it's not refuted or

366
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:04,659
dislike you fast fact such a beauty of

367
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:07,690
it is like now tradition of the weight

368
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,430
that science bring with it for me ash

369
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,769
and everything that is happening it's

370
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:14,110
the same I need that science to be able

371
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:17,730
to prove explain what I experience with

372
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:17,729
the plant and everything on my life

373
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,799
nobody sings of my home and the life web

374
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:36,039
of the sort when everything is coming

375
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:37,569
from that simple three words or less and

376
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:43,149
so I came up with something that I

377
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:45,669
referred to as symbiosis to synapse so I

378
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:48,450
think that's a very good way of relating

379
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:51,700
that you know because your brain

380
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,200
and then the symbiosis so I think that's

381
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,240
really a good expression I could be

382
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,370
wrong but I like to keep things very

383
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:08,169
simple for people's every word is rule

384
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:13,689
to a good visual yes right moseys that

385
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:29,070
if you could simplify it even more that

386
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:32,409
you would say kind of embodies I work at

387
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:35,528
fairly small scales and then build the

388
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:37,990
layers up and look at each layer you

389
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:40,000
know we often talk about breadth of

390
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,880
knowledge well we need depth of

391
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,929
knowledge as well kind of like our roots

392
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,120
yeah hmm it's somewhat similar so here's

393
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:52,269
the question how roots will the roots

394
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:55,629
grow how deep will the roots go it

395
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:57,970
depends standard ecological answer it

396
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,970
depends on the conditions most plants

397
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:06,159
can be put in their root systems down 15

398
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:09,250
20 25 100 you know you get two feet feet

399
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:16,690
feet yeah why is my plant growing in the

400
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:22,960
pot this small SMO Tina but that's a

401
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:26,980
good question yeah there is no thougts

402
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:33,909
there's no smart foot it's a nice it's a

403
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:36,880
nice bone name but she knows the main

404
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:40,149
the woods destroys a bottom and go

405
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:47,860
straight down is empty to clue that you

406
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:49,839
don't you see then confine the soil when

407
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:52,959
we don't have plant material on the

408
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:55,119
surface of the soil then rain frame will

409
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,460
hit that surface and cause compaction at

410
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,500
some depth which means your roots going

411
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,329
down can't get through that they're

412
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,648
gonna go

413
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:04,079
ways and they're gonna fight with their

414
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:06,028
neighbor you know fight with things

415
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,298
around none of your plants are gonna be

416
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:13,259
healthy so instead of them thriving as a

417
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:16,710
community this is a metaphor - they're

418
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:20,690
fighting for survival mm-hmm yeah it's

419
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,690
warfare and then I think I'd fight

420
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:33,990
nature really selects more towards

421
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:36,148
symbiosis working together socially with

422
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,470
plants in the soil they should have

423
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:40,079
Michael right so fungi that they're

424
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,600
sharing and therefore every plant in

425
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:45,928
this whole thousand acres should be

426
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:48,298
connected equally as healthy because

427
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:52,559
they're connected below ground this is

428
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:54,990
really one plant the aspen tree is a

429
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:58,230
literal example that a lot of people

430
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:01,079
know because when an aspen tree turns a

431
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:03,659
whole hillside will turn because it's

432
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:07,849
really one tree with lots of branches

433
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:12,750
that come up as a ground runners right

434
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:15,629
where in our situation we know that it's

435
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,898
not just one tree it's one community and

436
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,889
we want the whole thing to be healthy

437
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:22,500
everything connected below ground

438
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:25,009
because then everything's healthy if any

439
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,069
one of those plants are is healthy then

440
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:44,579
yeah that Chinese there is any one that

441
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:48,359
cannot fit the other violent when you

442
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:52,470
think of it it's yeah the potato heating

443
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:55,199
issues every theory until there is the

444
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:59,370
goodness that the plant is is taking

445
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,769
from it I didn't I hope you really like

446
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:04,288
the plant is the farmer you know the

447
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:08,210
plant is putting out the exudates to

448
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:10,519
grow this system to protect itself to

449
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:13,009
both above ground as

450
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:16,460
below ground the the plant is in control

451
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:20,509
of all of this and since World War one

452
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:23,420
human beings have started to forget

453
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:26,000
about that not pay attention to it the

454
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:29,660
plant is stupid we have to supply it

455
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,410
with all of its nutrients it can't fend

456
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,900
for itself you have to put all of this

457
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,060
effort into growing a plant or as if you

458
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,340
would just stop and let the right

459
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:43,159
biology come back the plants perfectly

460
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:44,779
capable of growing itself of getting the

461
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:48,040
nutrients that it requires and

462
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:50,569
protecting itself without us adding

463
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:55,339
truckloads of amendment that it doesn't

464
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:57,529
mean we're killing ourselves as the

465
00:24:55,339 --> 00:25:00,789
winner you to know that your Warren PK

466
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:04,430
that you're the one induced fee of

467
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:06,710
feeding penalties raised on the sea I

468
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:10,730
demand that you find aunt you burn the

469
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:14,590
plant so you figure it out away the

470
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:17,599
world a limitation of the living

471
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:20,269
organism burning that living organ is

472
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,879
and checking what is left from it it's

473
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:25,910
like how would you figure out the

474
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,810
alimentation of a human being by burning

475
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:32,540
a and getting the data from the ashes it

476
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:35,149
doesn't make sense in the first place is

477
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:37,849
that it's scary and everybody follow it

478
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:43,940
and the people bullshit you with a veil

479
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:46,699
of no jikan opposed to me that is really

480
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:57,559
scary and like nobody asked question

481
00:25:46,700 --> 00:26:00,259
it's all good chemistry where you have a

482
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:02,389
huge number of emergent properties that

483
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:04,519
you cannot predict just on the basis of

484
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,730
the chemistry in your body the mineral

485
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:09,859
elements you can't you can't predict

486
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:14,569
human behavior from that point of view

487
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:17,659
so why do we keep trying to do that and

488
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:21,259
it's all it's used as an excuse to sell

489
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,519
people something they don't mean they

490
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:25,579
put themselves into that

491
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:32,170
trap they get too needy touch them

492
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:34,879
because they have no choice but an

493
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:39,940
addictive relationship you know they

494
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:43,070
have to go back just like that one time

495
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:45,019
and they're dead they're not there to do

496
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:47,299
the job that the plants expecting them

497
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:49,160
to do so now the plants not getting the

498
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,740
nutrition it's not getting what it needs

499
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:55,519
so he thinks that we have to come along

500
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:58,099
and we have to provide it if you kill

501
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:04,849
the organisms then you're gonna have to

502
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:07,219
do their job and we are doing the job

503
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:10,059
that these microorganisms should be

504
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:12,769
doing and they love to do it yeah yeah

505
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:16,190
like human beings living in houses and

506
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:17,690
stuff yeah human beings over there we

507
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,430
want to grow we want to have families

508
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,470
well sort of the organisms in the soil

509
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,730
that's just their house yeah why do we

510
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,490
keep destroying that one they're only

511
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:27,170
trying to do what they're supposed to do

512
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:30,049
because somebody wants to sell you

513
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:33,620
something they're not mine you don't

514
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:37,129
yeah doctor is there any evidence in

515
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:41,329
using crystals or rocks with plant or

516
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:44,720
living organisms in earth to you know we

517
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:47,990
don't have and that's the problem

518
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,200
yes there sometimes seems to be a

519
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:54,620
benefit the frequency oh the time yeah

520
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,750
cuz we're we don't have machines we

521
00:27:54,619 --> 00:28:03,829
don't have a way to assess it and if you

522
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:06,200
can't measure something feeling for a

523
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:10,179
while and I wasn't sure if you know if

524
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,880
there was any kind of say yes yeah

525
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:16,820
scientists point to work on how we

526
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:22,250
measure this yes how do you measure moon

527
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:24,909
for tidal forces different kinds of

528
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:28,339
energies coming through the atmosphere

529
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:30,500
area yes resonant frequency and exactly

530
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:33,689
yeah so that's that's fine thank you

531
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:36,029
yes sorry no I

532
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:39,029
this is how I answered that question to

533
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:41,759
my kid not that's the city I don't know

534
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:44,009
and then I say let's go find out and

535
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,930
sometimes it's a Google search

536
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:47,640
sometimes it's us going out to the

537
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:51,509
garden because he's like what happens if

538
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:55,070
you do this my garden is a place where

539
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:59,490
he can experiment growing life and

540
00:28:55,069 --> 00:29:01,919
sometimes it means he kills my plans but

541
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:05,309
my plants once they die stop growing

542
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,220
they go they don't get ripped out they

543
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:11,119
go back into the soil like I don't even

544
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:16,980
pull roots the root is the pathway

545
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:19,079
exactly so you don't take that plant and

546
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,259
throw it on the waste pile and take it

547
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:25,259
off to the landfill oh yeah

548
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:28,559
why would you do that and yet we've

549
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:30,750
we've taught the current generations

550
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:42,659
that that's what you do here in the

551
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:46,319
United States it's what you don't leave

552
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:59,450
the you don't leave something you can be

553
00:29:46,319 --> 00:30:03,929
busted for a reality to the culture so

554
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:06,200
why are you growing in pots so that one

555
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,200
rabbit

556
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:13,289
seeing where the plum goes because it's

557
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,990
prohibition you don't live shit in your

558
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:18,779
garden you burn it you saw it in a place

559
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:21,150
nobody see it it's like there's a lot of

560
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:22,889
stuff that people do is because of

561
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:28,110
prohibition and they don't really know

562
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:31,920
better leave that material I'm a soil

563
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:34,669
surface that it grows pathogens it grows

564
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:38,019
[Music]

565
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:40,870
that's how it started yeah

566
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:42,579
so should we be taking the organic

567
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:45,250
material that grew right up out of the

568
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:47,799
ground that we're standing from and then

569
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,779
use that to go back into the ground yeah

570
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:54,609
it has to do that that's what should be

571
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:57,730
happening but who's making money yeah

572
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:59,859
that's how you have to go that's what

573
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:05,110
it's like when you create start out of

574
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:07,000
quality you can define as well not only

575
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:09,579
the microbial life that is going to be

576
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,250
moved actually to do such-and-such a

577
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:15,659
plant in such a such a place but you can

578
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:19,000
control every aspect of it so that

579
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:21,190
people like given me as a ice maker okay

580
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,789
I gonna make I gotta spin them in water

581
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:27,580
but then I should put them back to the

582
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:29,740
plan that gave me it and it's like there

583
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:34,389
is every plant on the planet is going

584
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:36,970
from the preceding generation I mean

585
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:39,009
that's what they do so not having that

586
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:41,350
it's something we are missing or so in

587
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:44,410
that it like I was telling them last

588
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:46,689
night there is if the plant has an

589
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,970
epigenetic memory how come we always

590
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,650
have all the problem that there is here

591
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:55,450
that I have never seen in producing

592
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:57,580
country like the plant should be after a

593
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,509
few generations have no problem

594
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:07,119
whatsoever

595
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:10,569
it like at best the best genetic here in

596
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:14,500
this paradigm of conventional

597
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:16,629
agriculture they are killing all of

598
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,299
those things that would be allowing that

599
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,970
plant to develop the resistant

600
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:27,730
populations a bacteria fungi protozoa

601
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:32,769
nematodes in this weakness we need to

602
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:34,839
create strength don't these weeks there

603
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:37,990
is something going wrong me elastic

604
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:41,049
that's weak it's a lack of the proper

605
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:43,120
biology in the soil the plant feeds

606
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:45,798
those organisms in the soil using

607
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,808
exudates using sugars and

608
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:49,249
proteins and carbohydrates being

609
00:32:47,808 --> 00:32:51,528
released from that root system and that

610
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:54,679
plant is expecting to have those

611
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:57,319
organisms around that root system in

612
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:00,350
that soil because it's been there for

613
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:08,058
the last four billion years so the

614
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:10,459
plants and we've destroyed in modern

615
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:19,278
agriculture we've destroyed that biology

616
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:20,509
for the I was telling them it because

617
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,710
maybe who is this

618
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:26,720
they don't winter lucid in account so

619
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:30,769
that there is something missing in that

620
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:34,069
world seasonal life of the plant and

621
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:36,259
maybe not I think the seed in the ground

622
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:40,489
in a winter maybe you don't have that

623
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:43,220
memory changing the DNA and giving the

624
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:46,038
data to the next generation but I never

625
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:49,519
thought about the soul at that level

626
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:51,288
either having the seed in the ground

627
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:56,538
hopefully we've got other scenes you

628
00:33:51,288 --> 00:34:00,739
know there are to the place you know

629
00:33:56,538 --> 00:34:04,608
what I mean because we the keep it they

630
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:07,850
protect it in a winter they just put it

631
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:10,338
in the fridge often - before germinating

632
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:12,289
it there is something that is not

633
00:34:10,338 --> 00:34:16,838
happening in the life of that seed that

634
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:19,398
normally happen - to see that face

635
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:22,039
evolution and diversity you know I mean

636
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:24,230
maybe this is why exactly doesn't get

637
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:26,409
stronger and stronger generation after

638
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,409
generation

639
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:46,569
these are questions that are honest

640
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:50,000
questions we don't know the answer yet I

641
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:52,730
think we have observations where I'm I

642
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,039
would probably say I don't think that

643
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,590
that scene being in the soil through

644
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:02,029
that winter time period is all that

645
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:05,590
important in the soil over winter may

646
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:14,780
not be important may not be that

647
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:19,099
important me movies that's something

648
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:21,050
like the springtime we see all those

649
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:23,420
populations of beneficial organisms

650
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:25,039
develop around the root system and move

651
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,680
up on to the above-ground part of the

652
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:31,039
plant we grow plants that have no

653
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:35,210
diseases no pests no lack of fertility

654
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:37,070
and so that leads me to suspect we don't

655
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,559
have to have that seed in the ground

656
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:43,400
there isn't really anything that really

657
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:45,500
requires that to happen because we're

658
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:52,519
not having plants that are weak and

659
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:55,730
unhealthy from it was like for the plant

660
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:58,579
to really become part of the terroir to

661
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:01,960
become heirloom I think that is that

662
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:05,889
something that they miss and to breed to

663
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:10,190
breed with the plum that strive after

664
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:13,009
going after a winter under out condition

665
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:15,349
that slowly slowly you created genetics

666
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:20,330
that become an heirloom literally that

667
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:25,280
is its local and now might that might be

668
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:32,269
more the defensive system as much as I

669
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:34,730
thought well the flavonoids you develop

670
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:37,880
the developing some chemistry in that

671
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:39,769
plant that is very dependent on making

672
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,920
certain you have exactly the right sets

673
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:45,019
of microorganisms to end up with that

674
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,750
flavor that in

675
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:50,599
my and really it might be that you have

676
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,880
to save the seed from those plants and

677
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:55,299
plant those seeds in the springtime

678
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,300
again

679
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:09,560
organisms in the soil as well as those

680
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:11,299
results but I never won by difficulty

681
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:17,469
Oliver yeah no no never

682
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:17,470
it's like I'm it's super fascinating

683
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:26,449
bring it bring another dimension to your

684
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:30,200
ability to fine-tune and makes the best

685
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:37,909
of of what the longest to offer you I

686
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:40,279
mean we should and we should clean what

687
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:42,379
we cannot do the best out of it as fast

688
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,890
as we can and that's right and we know

689
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:48,110
that we need to make compost in the

690
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:50,329
location that you're going to use that

691
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:53,059
compost because it's the indigenous

692
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:55,400
species the bacteria fungi protozoa numb

693
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:58,719
toes micro arthropods that we want to

694
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:03,139
have growing and becoming a high number

695
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:05,179
large biomass so that selects for plants

696
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:08,358
that can grow in a healthy fashion in

697
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:11,210
this community we don't want to be

698
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:14,029
taking compost from Alaska and bringing

699
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:17,389
it to Southern California because the

700
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:19,490
organisms from Alaska don't survive in

701
00:38:17,389 --> 00:38:23,449
that desert kind of system or vice versa

702
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:25,009
the desert organisms can survive reason

703
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:28,549
up here I'm having a hard time surviving

704
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:31,730
and I'm from central California we're up

705
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:35,269
in Alaska Jeff would be happy we'd be

706
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:38,329
free frozen nobody's a kid like that

707
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:41,509
world operation division in France it's

708
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:46,279
over is about that concerted holes that

709
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:48,560
local web life that is used that makes

710
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,530
the quality of the project that go here

711
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,630
why would you bring from the outside and

712
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,910
change the recipe when the recipe is

713
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,519
like wow you know what I mean while you

714
00:38:55,909 --> 00:39:00,519
have when you have unique

715
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,590
and quality that recipes that the Lord

716
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:07,750
is giving you you just want to protect

717
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:11,110
it and nourish it basically so if the

718
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:14,079
plan is the farmer and it's the one

719
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:16,510
telling the whole ecosystem below the

720
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:22,000
surface what's going on and what it

721
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:25,960
needs what's our job our job is to grow

722
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,420
eggs yeah harvest of it yeah and then

723
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:31,139
make certain that those organisms that

724
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:34,030
are supposed to be in that soil are are

725
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:36,789
promoted that they're you make sure that

726
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:40,810
they're gonna still be there for the

727
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:42,699
next crop that the plant is the only

728
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:44,199
thing that promise won't each to work

729
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:46,659
adios that's it

730
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:50,379
the name of the game is the production

731
00:39:46,659 --> 00:39:56,618
the best condition the IPOs the plant is

732
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:59,590
gonna is going to be maximum nutrition

733
00:39:56,619 --> 00:40:02,650
in it maximum quality that's the purpose

734
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:06,450
of that plant and we're just helping

735
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:09,880
ourselves to that bounty so I like that

736
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:12,519
we reserve some of those seats so we

737
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:16,358
plant them again we don't have to worry

738
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:18,099
about rotation if we don't kill off the

739
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:19,929
biology in the soil you're not gonna

740
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:21,309
have disease you're not gonna have pests

741
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:23,259
you're not gonna have a lack of

742
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:25,150
fertility you have more than enough

743
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,119
nutrients in your soil especially with

744
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:32,139
organic matter

745
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:34,300
yeah all of it world class mine right

746
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:38,579
you're killing things when you're

747
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,580
putting in those buckets of other stuff

748
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:59,740
let's be natural I mean there is no

749
00:40:56,889 --> 00:41:02,529
mostly you organic and you don't touch

750
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:03,519
any chemical and neutral and pesticide

751
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,750
or you're not

752
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,199
must be doesn't

753
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:11,980
it's not about organic because salts

754
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:15,099
organic and if I put salt all over the

755
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:20,800
base of my plant it's organic but is it

756
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:23,679
gonna grow yeah I needed to help that

757
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,690
plant grow in a healthy fashion well I'm

758
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:28,149
not a very good Stewart if I'm killing

759
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:32,500
the farmer mm-hmm how do we get started

760
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:38,590
down that path like you know using being

761
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:41,619
dependent on petrochemicals started with

762
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:44,890
the mechanical tractor where that when

763
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:48,519
we went from us having to hold the plow

764
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:50,409
on the ground and push it and we have to

765
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,500
expend all of our energy making sure

766
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:57,789
that horse or mule or whatever pulling

767
00:41:53,500 --> 00:42:01,599
that plow as we go from one human being

768
00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:04,420
can only manage a small acreage you know

769
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,909
probably no more than 20 or 40 acres

770
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:09,460
something like that you can engineer for

771
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:12,219
a much larger parcel parcel if you're

772
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:14,230
not telling it there's no need to tell

773
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:15,730
well the dependence on petrochemicals

774
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:23,110
like we're we right that's it's a

775
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:25,900
vicious cycle which it really is so you

776
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:28,150
know we have to we have to do something

777
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,430
to put seed into the ground and that

778
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:33,539
usually means you and a plow and a horse

779
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:37,239
and you've got to apply that muscle and

780
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:38,829
you can't manage that much land all by

781
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:41,019
yourself well if you have kids and you

782
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:45,099
can have you know okay so there's the

783
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:47,349
grow a family yeah and as when the

784
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:48,099
mechanical tractor was invented in

785
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:51,239
Australia

786
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:55,059
thank you Australians for messing us up

787
00:42:51,239 --> 00:43:00,009
and also you could jump on a tractor and

788
00:42:55,059 --> 00:43:01,750
you could kill a hundred acres and of

789
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,990
course as soon as you start doing that

790
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:07,239
you put your seed in what comes up

791
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:10,449
because you've tilled the soil you've

792
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:13,299
brought that seed bank of wheats to the

793
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:15,339
surface of the soil so what do you do to

794
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,769
prevent those weeds from growing you go

795
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,309
out and you till again and you slice and

796
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:20,708
dice

797
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:23,199
crushin destroy the biology that your

798
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:26,818
plant needs in order to be able to

799
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:30,818
out-compete those weeds or you since but

800
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:33,400
pesticides and herbicides on plants we

801
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:35,498
came back from world war one or world

802
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,680
war two is when it really starts getting

803
00:43:35,498 --> 00:43:41,018
massive alien and what do you do with

804
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:43,748
all of the munitions that were not gonna

805
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:45,659
have to use because we dropped the

806
00:43:43,748 --> 00:43:48,909
atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

807
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:52,409
and we ended the war two years early and

808
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:54,879
that means we had literally pile of

809
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:57,368
munitions that weren't gonna get used

810
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,249
and somebody noticed that if you threw

811
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:02,548
those munitions on an agricultural field

812
00:44:00,248 --> 00:44:04,899
the plants started growing better

813
00:44:02,548 --> 00:44:07,630
because we had already destroyed the

814
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:10,048
biology in the soil now when those

815
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:13,449
plants get those soluble inorganic

816
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:15,400
nutrients they grow there whereas if you

817
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:17,650
had the biology in the soil and you

818
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:23,469
through those spent those munitions out

819
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:27,579
there's absolutely no effect yeah

820
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:29,019
so it's that destruction of the biology

821
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:31,568
in the soil because of the mechanical

822
00:44:29,018 --> 00:44:35,608
tractor and then the imposition of the

823
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:39,608
wars having just at the right time so

824
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:42,699
that now we went down this pathway of

825
00:44:39,608 --> 00:44:45,308
the Green Revolution and in order to

826
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:47,769
reverse that we've gotta start putting

827
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:49,769
this biology back into the soil so when

828
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:52,718
you put those inorganic fertilizers on

829
00:44:49,768 --> 00:44:55,868
nothing happens it's a waste of your

830
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:57,458
time and you're gonna stop that's right

831
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:59,650
gonna stop using those pesticides

832
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:02,038
because you don't have the problem with

833
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:04,869
those those pests and that's diseases

834
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:06,339
like cancer or is that that burned also

835
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,349
in your butt because every scene is

836
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:10,358
smaller in your heart it didn't have

837
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:12,939
that much of an impact in Europe it's

838
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:15,038
all small farm so yeah you're going to

839
00:45:12,938 --> 00:45:16,989
use a tractor on your bigger piece but

840
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,359
not everybody or they were sharing it

841
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:20,739
they were much less damaged what is the

842
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,708
word that means you have much less

843
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:25,778
damage and and it was also the time

844
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:27,460
where they were pushing poison on us

845
00:45:25,778 --> 00:45:32,909
because nobody knew better

846
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:32,909
I make your life easier just about there

847
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:39,028
Europeans resisted more dis didn't see

848
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:41,318
the point and purpose in it can we

849
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:42,849
answer that question

850
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:45,038
looks president um the question about

851
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:47,619
where do we all start to a long time I

852
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,690
think it was actually when Europeans

853
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,548
came to the United States and we looked

854
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,440
at the Native Americans and shot that

855
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:55,269
weird that they were doing it wrong and

856
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,338
that they weren't making money off of it

857
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:59,889
and we can make it better I mean they

858
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:01,929
were looking to nature for all their

859
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:04,538
answers they are working with ecology

860
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:07,358
and fire and I mean they were really

861
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:08,500
putting it back in watching the earth

862
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:11,798
and how it worked

863
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:13,210
biomimicry in the end they all we can do

864
00:46:11,798 --> 00:46:15,639
it better we're going to cut down all

865
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:19,139
these trees we're gonna mix up the dirt

866
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:21,818
and that's where sorry is making money

867
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:23,949
um when you look at the Europeans when

868
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:25,179
they first arrived in the United States

869
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:28,239
they went into the typical

870
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:32,409
slash-and-burn approach where you were

871
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:35,739
hungry you would cut down all of the

872
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:39,338
forests you till this land you would get

873
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:42,699
the crop for five to ten maybe even 15

874
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:44,949
years at which point everything's a

875
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:49,149
disease that's unhappy you can't make a

876
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:52,028
yield so you go to the next plot and you

877
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:55,048
take down the trees you kill it you

878
00:46:52,028 --> 00:46:57,789
repeat that whole cycle if you go to the

879
00:46:55,048 --> 00:46:58,750
journals of Thomas Jefferson at

880
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:01,690
Monticello

881
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:06,219
in Virginia you see that's exactly what

882
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:08,260
he was doing was he do a Greek ulcer

883
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:10,629
here and then have to move there and

884
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:12,490
then had to move again and then he had

885
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,588
to move again and then he had to move

886
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:17,949
again and then he had to come back to

887
00:47:14,588 --> 00:47:20,710
that first original plot and he could

888
00:47:17,949 --> 00:47:23,108
not grow the crops that he used to be

889
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:26,108
able to grow when he did slash and burn

890
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:29,409
and so he started working with compost

891
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:31,150
he started trying to put whatever it was

892
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:33,068
he didn't really understand what it was

893
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:38,210
but he was trying to put it back into

894
00:47:33,068 --> 00:47:42,599
the soil not being very effective no but

895
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:47,970
it's civilization and nomadic life it

896
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:50,759
clash but listening to Valen most of the

897
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:55,469
bigger civilization that were that lived

898
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:57,060
on a planet where died because the Dixie

899
00:47:55,469 --> 00:48:00,179
kills the soul and they could not

900
00:47:57,059 --> 00:48:02,480
nourish themselves so it's we started

901
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:06,509
that from the beginning of civilization

902
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:09,480
the beginning of Agriculture we have not

903
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:21,180
been doing very good civilization a

904
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:22,170
civilization Oh magic people who use the

905
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:24,419
plant kingdom

906
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:28,829
but didn't control it it's vastly

907
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:30,659
different but at the same times humanity

908
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:33,269
when they come in that continent they

909
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:35,699
destroyed every animal prehistoric

910
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:38,730
animal that was really big in the matter

911
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:43,259
of a thousand year unless so it's like

912
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:46,019
don't sing that the Indian and all what

913
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:50,070
a good thing in in America did not have

914
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:52,409
a huge impact on the on the continent

915
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:57,030
like all that the people living in the

916
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:59,069
Peru that world Mississippi civilization

917
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:01,740
they starve themselves to death

918
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:04,980
literally because they killed the soul

919
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:07,919
and now that I'm thinking I'm starting

920
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:09,659
to sing backward to a bunch of like I

921
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,849
know really well my store on the

922
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:14,219
Mediterranean Sea and you know a lot of

923
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:16,440
it it's like they don't talk much about

924
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:19,859
it but it slowly slowly the territory

925
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:22,740
getting a lead so they have to to move

926
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:26,460
on and then they go they they go into

927
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:28,859
other people territory and Europe wasn't

928
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:32,190
that deep they've been walking each

929
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:45,059
other since since civilization was born

930
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:48,090
I wanna say the reality that this is the

931
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:48,869
biggest treat for me I hope you

932
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:51,960
understand

933
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:54,480
so I'm dr. Elaine in ham my company

934
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:58,500
soil food web incorporated and so a food

935
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,630
web school and I spend my life going

936
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:03,750
around talking to people about all of

937
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:06,059
these concepts promoting getting away

938
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,849
from the toxic chemicals growing plants

939
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:12,750
in the most natural of ways all using

940
00:50:08,849 --> 00:50:15,630
all plants are plants using life in the

941
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:18,030
soil those organisms who vent were the

942
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:21,230
first ones on this planet and started

943
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:24,630
everything rolling so let's go back and

944
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:26,190
replenish that biology that's supposed

945
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:31,590
to be in the soil to help your plants

946
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:38,909
grow better mei-li see from the farmers

947
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:41,340
that receive from the living so I'm at

948
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:44,429
the end of the of the shine and the more

949
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:48,960
I know about what give me quality is a

950
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:52,109
better I can I can pass it down to other

951
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,990
bazooka and my name is Ryan nos from

952
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:58,860
Central Coast let it grow where that's

953
00:50:54,989 --> 00:51:01,199
what all I want to do is grow thank you

954
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:04,519
so much I also want to say thank you so

955
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:08,579
much to future cannabis project and

956
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:13,530
signs of the times signs for the times

957
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:15,569
and the one log dispensary we're so

958
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:18,540
grateful for this venue which is

959
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:22,490
probably the most unique we are

960
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:27,029
literally inside of a home made from one

961
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:29,159
redwood tree its hollowed out and its

962
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:31,280
oh how cool is that thank you so very

963
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:31,279
much

964
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:45,859
