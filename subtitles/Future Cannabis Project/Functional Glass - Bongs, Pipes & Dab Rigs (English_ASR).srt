1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,678
other you know other stuff that's much

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,278
more artistic but that was kind of the

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:06,240
beginning for a lot of people i knew

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:07,759
especially the guys that came out

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,120
sawgrass shop back in

6
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,120
you know 93-94

7
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,800
yeah i wish i wish i could say i had

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,600
such an artistic beginning

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,600
but far from it it was more

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,629
how do i disrupt the whole world with a

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
gravity bomb

12
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:29,599
[Music]

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,198
turns out not everybody wants to smoke

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,198
out of a gravity bong but uh

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,520
it still does pretty well you'd be

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,399
surprised

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,399
hi sarah hi guys

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,840
i still sell a lot of gravitrons

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,479
[Laughter]

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,359
it does well surprisingly well i mean

21
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:57,439
it's still like a good

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,479
four or five percent of the catalog five

23
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,358
percent of sales

24
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,479
it's uh it's strong i mean that's that's

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,400
that's an outlier

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:08,079
right you know the the gravity bond or

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,200
the gravitron and the spoon are

28
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:16,239
are the major outliers for us um

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,520
but yeah been a long journey

30
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,519
how's 420 science sarah

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,840
um we're doing pretty good

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,239
um so guys in just a minute uh

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,159
yeah i don't know if you know a future

34
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,280
canvas project but uh peter cerveri is

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,439
gonna try to um

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,280
come in he's gonna live audio this thing

37
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,078
into future canvas project for youtube

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,439
live

39
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:38,719
so dave i think we're probably expecting

40
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:39,199
one or two others that might pop in

41
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,719
again

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,000
if you and sarah see folks in the

43
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,359
industry that you guys want to pull up

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,959
on stage as well

45
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,118
you know as you know i try to do a

46
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,559
sunday night show i try to find a

47
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,680
different topic every week and i try to

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,759
dig into it with people that

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,360
understand that part of the industry so

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,159
we've covered everything from policy and

51
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,519
legislation

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,560
to horticultural lighting to um

53
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,078
uh canvas investing so every week we

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,600
just dig into a different part sometimes

55
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,158
it gets super nerdy like last week we

56
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,399
did um

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,359
you know ip and trademarks but this week

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,038
we figured we'd make it a little bit

59
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,318
more light and uh bring in some people

60
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,439
have been working in the glass industry

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,039
for a long time

62
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,400
yeah for me it's part of you know part

63
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,719
of how i got my start in the industry

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,959
back in like 1993 i guess

65
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,639
when i really started um carrying around

66
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,239
gun cases on dead tour with uh with a

67
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,679
bunch of glass in them and

68
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,239
starting to work with guys like jason

69
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,719
harris and with bob snodgrass and

70
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,200
bob batrom and and uh cameron and a

71
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,800
whole bunch of other early kind of guys

72
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,479
that you know really for me was a really

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,239
fun way to go around and make some money

74
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,000
in the lot both the same time you know

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,840
being able to collect pieces along the

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,120
way so

77
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,239
over the last couple of years you and i

78
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,439
have gotten to know each other i know

79
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,319
you've got one of the coolest gloss

80
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,239
companies out there

81
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,759
with uh with graphs sarah you and i

82
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,439
unfortunately have not met i've heard a

83
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,639
lot about you and heard great things

84
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,159
so i'm really excited to have you on

85
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,439
this panel tonight and as i said as

86
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,400
other people you know come in

87
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,800
we're certainly going to invite some

88
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,719
people up so dave you know

89
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
how did you get started in glasgow okay

90
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,439
give me some roots especially as you

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,878
come out of texas which isn't exactly

92
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,199
what people think of as you know kind of

93
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,359
like

94
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,719
a hotbed of cannabis culture and you

95
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,800
know i know that's changing

96
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,158
but um but you know how did you get your

97
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,200
start in the industry and how did you

98
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:16,479
get involved in the glass industry

99
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,199
um i uh well first of all thanks for

100
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,919
having us

101
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,719
and i've really enjoyed this uh ask me

102
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,359
anything sick

103
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,878
session that you do on sundays so highly

104
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,760
encourage everyone to spread the word

105
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:31,359
it's fantastic every week

106
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:34,000
i i came

107
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
up as i just i really just wanted to

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,360
make a gravity bomb

109
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,560
and it was a it was just kind of an

110
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,720
experiment

111
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,479
of you know can i make something that is

112
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,878
you know that you know that is mark you

113
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,840
know uh viable in market

114
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,120
um and at the time the only gravity bong

115
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
that was out there was the g

116
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,200
bub and i don't know who ended up like

117
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,120
producing those i think

118
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,958
they were coming out of phoenix and i

119
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,560
can't remember who what shop was doing

120
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,360
it but the original designer was ham i

121
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,878
think

122
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,200
and but it was a 300 you know

123
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,560
bong sized gravity bong and it was

124
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,798
really cleverly designed

125
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
but it was just too expensive so i set

126
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,438
out to make a commercially viable

127
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,160
you know accessible all glass gravity

128
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,680
bomb

129
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,600
and um that's a really long story but

130
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,280
you know flash flashing forward it took

131
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,080
me a few months to you know to figure

132
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,079
out that

133
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,478
the best way to do it was to get a vase

134
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,758
from michaels and you know cut the

135
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,478
bottom off of a

136
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,160
wine bottle and then put a grommet and a

137
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,758
12 millimeter down stem with a nine

138
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
millimeter bullet to it

139
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,960
um and then flash forward to

140
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
you know now making these and selling

141
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,638
them in austin

142
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,079
i had to figure out how to make those

143
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,360
bowls cheaper so the

144
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,519
downstem in the bowl would ended up

145
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,120
being the biggest cause cost of my

146
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:56,879
you know assembly and um and so they

147
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,000
met freddy which is home blown glass

148
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,478
um sarah what's fred's last name do we

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
know

150
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,159
uh fred shorsh i believe is his last

151
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
name

152
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,080
well i don't know he's freddy from

153
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,519
emblem that's right just ready it

154
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,439
doesn't matter he's just ready

155
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,359
and freddie's been around since you know

156
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,680
the snogwrites days for sure

157
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,400
and freddie's been making he was just a

158
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,800
he was kind of a

159
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,918
at the time just a a pole shop right he

160
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,560
was making you know just

161
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,799
gorgeous glass slides so like nine

162
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,240
millimeter 12 millimeter slides that

163
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,639
um out of a shop in arizona phoenix

164
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,519
and um and so i would just take all his

165
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,199
rejects

166
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,639
he would sell me all his rejects for 50

167
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,560
cents and

168
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,720
um and so i would you know marching

169
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,800
around austin selling them kind of it

170

173
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,039
really

174
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,000
you really should come to the champs

175
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,159
trade show which is

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,360
you know the at the time apparently the

177
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,520
biggest trade show

178
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,960
you know for bongs that there was in

179
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,879
2005

180
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:06,719
and um and i and so i show up

181
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:10,159
with a 12 with 12 gravitrons and a

182
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,400
and a banner and the yeah and that was

183
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,319
it

184
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,159
i literally had it had a notebook like a

185
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,960
little like spiral notebook

186
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,919
and i sat down at the table put my

187
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,599
banner you know

188
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,439
duct taped my banner to the front of the

189
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,520
table off in the corner

190
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,560
the table cost me five hundred dollars

191
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,000
and

192
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,079
um and i put my bonds out and

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,839
sure enough people start coming up and

194
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,800
and saying okay i like it i'll place an

195
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,519
order

196
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,079
in which case i go okay great and they

197
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,799
say

198
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,519
okay do you want to write it down and of

199
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,280
course i just

200
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,038
i had no idea what to expect and you

201
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,758
know it turns out the champ show and

202
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,159
freddie

203
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,439
really kind of like open the door to you

204
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,240
know at that trade show i i

205
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,079
on boarded like 300 head shops and came

206
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,519
home that summer realizing oh shit i'm

207
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,959
gonna have to figure this out

208
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:01,680
so um so yeah i had a i had a product

209
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,000
um flash forward a few more years it was

210
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
like

211
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
you know i had 800 stores that i was

212
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,400
servicing

213
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,280
um so i should say that

214
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,839
um i met matt and gary also a for 420

215
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,000
science

216
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,439
at that first trade show and we became

217
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,160
fast friends and worked together

218
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,680
really ever since um but you know

219
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,120
flashing forward a few more years you

220
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,720
know i realized that you know

221
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,560
the world i wasn't going to disrupt the

222
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,160
entire cannabis industry with a

223
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,598
gravity bomb even though i still stand

224
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,479
by my word that it's the most efficient

225
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:33,120
way to

226
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:36,560
consume flour smokable flour

227
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,280
but despite that people want variety of

228
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,680
consumption

229
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,598
and so i set out to make a whole bunch

230
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,918
of different skus and now we sell

231
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,918
about 300 different top line

232
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,478
pipes mostly glass pipes only a couple

233
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,478
of vapes vape skews

234
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,520
that's awesome super cool to hear kind

235
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,839
of the progression of just

236
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,598
how a rod started and just you know how

237
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,279
progression uh has allowed you just to

238
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,959
build a massive company since then it's

239
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,719
got now 300 skus

240
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,000
sarah how about you how did you get

241
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,319
started and kind of where are you right

242
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,079
now

243
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,639
in the process i'd love to hear more

244
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:16,959
about your story

245
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:20,160
um so i started working at 420 science

246
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,638
in 2007

247
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,560
because i needed a job i was an interior

248
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,478
designer in phoenix and the housing

249
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,879
market was crashing

250
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,560
and i knew matt and gary i was really

251
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,719
good friends with them

252
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,479
and their founding story is very similar

253
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,000
to dave and involves freddie

254
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,158
telling them well

255
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
actually gary worked at this place that

256
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,000
did like printing

257
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,839
and was you know used to print these

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
pint glasses for freddy's home brew that

259
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
he always brought to champs

260
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,639
and gary was like oh you should put this

261
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,360
logo

262
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,480
on these little stash jars and sell them

263
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,839
you know as

264
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,240
stash jars for your weed and freddy was

265
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,680
like no but you could do that

266
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,959
and so that's what they did

267
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,039
and uh it took off and flash forward a

268
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,838
couple years to when i needed a job i

269
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,159
was like the second person they hired

270
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,279
and uh i started out just doing like

271
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,439
data entry

272
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,039
you know bookkeeping and then i started

273
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,360
answering the phones

274
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,879
and then i was like pretty good at sales

275
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,720
and that's

276
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,799
kind of how i came up in the company all

277
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,839
the way up to um

278
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,439
i'm our visionary now i've been here

279
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,440
i've been with them a really long time

280
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,040
i've we've gone through lots of

281
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,800
different stuff we went from selling

282
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,958
stash jars to

283
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,599
um what was our first thing we added the

284
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:45,599
420 scope

285
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,278
and uh and then res block was

286
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
which is a resin preventer for water

287
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,159
pipes and

288
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:54,000
um back in 2013

289
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,079
we were like okay it kind of feels safe

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
enough we'll we'll put some pipes up and

291
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,920
see what happens

292
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,360
and i'm sorry been growing really fast

293
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:09,838
since then

294
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,839

00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,719
that was what i wanted you know for a

444
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,439
lack of a

445
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,000
family or tribalism or or you know

446
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
religious

447
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,039
or something like that in my life that's

448
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,120
what that's what filled that vacuum for

449
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,399
me being part of that

450
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,159
yeah i remember for me like one of the

451
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,600
happiest days of my life is when marie

452
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,879
looked me over and decided she's gonna

453
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,360
give me an account

454
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,639
and uh and that was the time i was like

455
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,800
sweet like all right

456
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,320
i'm i'm in stock shops going to allow me

457
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,359
to take their glass out on tour and

458
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,800
allow me to uh

459
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,000
to start selling pieces and then

460
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,519
obviously i was very good friends with

461
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,320
jennifer stroll and jen was dating

462
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,078
cameron at the time

463
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,519
so cameron took a liking as well and

464
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,198
that was just a really

465
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,120
lucky you know sort of happenstance for

466
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,758
me around like 1994.

467
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,039
so uh you know yeah cameron cameron

468
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,519
cameron taught me my first

469
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,120
uh how to make my first bong and so that

470
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,039
changed my world and um

471
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,879
you know my my history and being part of

472
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,439
this pipe thing is so

473
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,399
you know fulfilled and so you know just

474
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
cool and

475
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,679
and i'm so blessed to be a part of it

476
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,680
and so now

477
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,039
the the now in this whole pipe we call

478
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,120
it a piper movement

479
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,719
at least that's what i call it um you

480
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,480
know similar to a um

481
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,680
uh abstraction art or um or realist

482
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
or something like this this is a this is

483
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,399
an actual art movement that's going on

484
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,519
that we've been part of and now what

485
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,078
we're doing is

486
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,839
we are bringing light to the fact that

487
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,559
this is this stuff that we make is art

488
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,639
and it and it holds a value the problem

489
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,838
with what we make is that when we make

490
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,440
it

491
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,199
it sells so quickly and it goes into the

492
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,000
stoner circle sometimes it breaks

493
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,958
these invaluable pieces uh don't get to

494
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,120
be

495
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,799
seen and shared like like like we need

496
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,198
them and so right now

497
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,439
um it's about bringing eyes on the art

498
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:37,039
movement and creating a value that that

499
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,320
is is well deserved and so to do that

500
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,919
you know we we have to document the

501
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,879
pieces whether it's to be a picture

502

503

champs earlier you know

525
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,678
yeah man uh dave when you made reference

526
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,120
to champs earlier

527
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,720
like for me that was the first time that

528
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,199
someone came up with a trade show that

529
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,798
uh

530
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,798
that was truly just about the glass

531
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,000
industry was the first time you attended

532
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,359
champs and kind of like what was your

533
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,640
first thoughts when you uh when you went

534
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,279
were you there for one of the earliest

535
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,840
ones

536
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,319
and uh you know how have you watched it

537
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:48,480
progress

538
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,599
well first off i want to say that you

539
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,360
know jason

540
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,038
has been an absolute inspiration to a

541
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,879
lot of people in the industry and

542
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:58,960
myself included i mean at

543
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,000
even early on i recognize the importance

544
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,360
of branding and i think

545
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,839
that you know underrated jbd is like

546
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,038
really

547
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,240
the first brand in pipes right like

548
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,480
people don't talk about it yes

549
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,599
you you made you made a lot of art as

550
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,160
beautiful stuff

551
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,119
but you built a brand and like there was

552
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,200
it's just that

553
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,798
like we don't you know yes i know it's

554
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,080
like a you know it's very uh

555
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,079
cliche these days like everybody's

556
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,839
building a brand but you know

557
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,000
this is something i talk a lot a lot

558
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,279
about in cannabis period is that like we

559
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,960
are

560
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,319
the there are lots of people with lots

561
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,600
of money that are coming in and building

562
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,879
a cannabis brand well

563
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,759
you know there were cannabis brands

564
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,080
before cannabis became legal and

565
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,679
there is uh you know and you were really

566
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,119
like i think that's the most amazing

567
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,038
flag you can put in the ground to say i

568
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,399
was the first real cannabis brand

569
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:49,279
um so dave that's pretty cool

570
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,200
right right now right now that's uh my

571
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,440
my biggest pitch

572
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,960
is that is that i spent a lot of time in

573
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,320
in holland in the very beginning of all

574
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,240
this in the early 90s

575
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,480
i blew glass on this on the you know

576
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,919
varmint over there for a while

577
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,960
and i i came back and and in 95 is when

578
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,600
i actually incorporated the business

579
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,200
so you know at those times i was getting

580
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:12,558
flown around by the guys back in the

581
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,558
east coast holding the diesel

582
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:18,240
that whole diesel crew the chem dog guys

583
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,798
all them they would fly me back and pay

584
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,599
me per gram ten dollars a gram for my

585
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,720
glass

586
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:27,359
and so that right there was a a it's

587
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,440
my street you know cred it's it's saying

588
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,199
you know look that's an example of any

589
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,720
of the biggest guys in the cannabis

590
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,400
business i was dealing with them all

591
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,480
throughout and now they're all owners of

592
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,759

729
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,120
political statement

730
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,400

748
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,519
pieces that we're making are are

749
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,880
devices and these devices are actually

750
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,960
changing the fundamental

751
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,080
thought and character of society right

752
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,880

in high school and we are the changers

761

and there's more to it you know there's

795
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,200
a back story our tv show

that is different than all the others in

797
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,640
that it builds the character

798
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,000
all these 12 people that we brought to

799
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,038
the space

800
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,599
were very carefully picked and we had

801
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,558
you know

802
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,119
very we wanted to represent our piper

803
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:17,519
movement

804
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,119
the right way and so we're really proud

805
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,519
to you know to show this thing off and

806
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,879
i'm

807
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,558
and this is going to answer a lot of the

808
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,840
general public's questions about

809
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:25,599
you know what's going on but i do want

810
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,319
to tell you all that

811
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,079
not only is it still illegal the same

812
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,278
exact fucking laws are in place right

813
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,879
now where they can come arrest me for

814
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,119
doing the same shit

815
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,240
that also cannabis is illegal on a

816
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,399
federal level

817
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,519
they can be arrest anybody they want if

818
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,000
they wanted to

819
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,038
including us for over here uh

820
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,519
consciously

821
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,839
uh you know you know making plans and

822
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,480
and figuring out how to do illegal shit

823
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,798
so the quicker we can all realize that

824
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,480
we're just still operating as gangsters

825
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,158
the quicker we can bring this thing to

826
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,278
light and and get this thing in the

827
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,320
banks

828
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:03,440
and um we can all kind of

829
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,119
you know get the reward of this whole

830
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,120
life that we've done and worked so hard

831
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,278
for i think it's time you know what i

832
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,278

of you know who got caught up in this i

836
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:15,759
always think back to that chinese

837
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,439
proverb of you know you never know what

838
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,720
good news or bad news is and

839
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,519

sudden the other one's like oh it's

843
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,720
terrible and it turns out then because

844
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,759
they were hurt they didn't go somewhere

845
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,519
where they would have gotten caught in a

846
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,440
fire whatever the other story is but

847
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,639
you know from the perspective of tommy

848
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,840

849
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,038

00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,278
whole year but he also got

851
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,960
jordan belfort as a cellmate which ended

852
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:40,240
up being the uh the catalyst to bring us

853
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,440
the wolf of wall street

854
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,798

from that so you know it's so much

856
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:45,599
hilarious that

857
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,200
tommy ended up being the uh the catalyst

858
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,480
for uh for you know another just

859
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,360
terrific story

i'm really on board with you on that

863
00:27:54,558 --> 00:28:00,240
making lemonade from lemons

864
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:03,278
and uh and and this story of mine

865
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,599
and bringing that uh um positivity out

866
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,200
of the negativity um is told in a movie

867
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,918
that we did with leafly

868
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,319
so leafly the um you know the weed app

869
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,120
they

870
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,720
do a leafly dot tv and we did a movie on

871
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,759
there called redemption bong

872
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,240
and it tells the story of the arrests

873
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,919
and the hardships um but it tells also

874
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,079
the story of what positive can come out

875
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,240
of it and how to to be positive

876
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,480
and i think everybody especially in this

877
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,919
time needs to make sure that they

878
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,000
if they're if they're not good at

879
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,520
thinking positive you know try to and

880
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,240
try to help your friends and try to help

881
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,798
others

882
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,079
um just be you know be positive in this

883
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,599
time that we're in you can you we're

884
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,199
going to get through it and

885
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,558
that's that's you know and that's what

886
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,278
i'm pitching in this operation pipe

887
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,440
dreamers

888
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:47,200
is everybody if you don't know how to

889
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,798
you can blow glass at home

890
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,720
and make marbles and beads and be

891
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,158
successful and make money and feel good

892
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,159
about yourself

893
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,919
so you know we are able to bring that

894
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,159
light and use our voice

895
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,320
same as any other celebrity or rock star

896
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,039
or whatever you can you can choose to

897
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,240
use your your status and and create

898
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,158
positive change

899
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,599
and uh you know if those around you that

900
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,000
you surround yourself with are doing

901
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,480
that it makes it easier for you too

902
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,359
you know jason i i i really appreciate

903
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,759
the work you've done

904
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,119
and like i said definitely trailblazer

905
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,798
and i've talked about this a lot

906
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,119
in you know throughout my career

907
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:23,200
whenever i get the chance to talk to the

908
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,479
art the more artistic side of this

909
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,159
industry and

910
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,679
yeah the frustrating part for me as

911
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,559
someone who has collected by

912
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,440
over the years is that we can't we're

913
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,200
not going to build

914
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,880
a real art you know a real art category

915
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,640
until someone builds a legitimate

916
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,399
secondary market for it

917
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,000
and you know yeah it's easy for me to

918
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:43,278
just you know sit on the sidelines and

919
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
say someone should do this

920
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,359
i i'm busy and as much as i love to go

921
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,398
build a secondary market

922
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,119
you know we're not we're just not going

923
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:52,879
to build value in the category without

924
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:56,079
that

925
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,000
and um you know i just think it's an

926
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,359
interesting topic that has been

927
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,480
missing from functional you know pipe or

928
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,479
the the entire time

929
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,439
yeah absolutely and there is a secondary

930
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,520
market being

931
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,679
you know uh throttling right now and i

932
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,079
think that um

933
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,200
that there's there's just a lot of um a

934
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,119
lot of momentum

935
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,038
in it right now and i i think that we're

936
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,558
gonna be all good clear

937
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:24,558
the the pieces you know we're selling

938
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,960
pieces for 50 and 100 000

939
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,319
and they're pipes and bongs and people

940
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,558
are interested in them

941
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,079
i'm working with tommy right now we're

942
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:33,599
doing a piece that

943
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,519
he wants to sell for over a million

944
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,879
dollars so we're loading it with stones

945
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,440
and crystals and

946
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,039
gold and you know we're gonna put some

947
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,480
holy water in and hopefully talk

948
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,079
elon into buying it and send it to the

949
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,880
fucking space and even

950
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,079
put some more light on this thing so

951
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,600
when i when i was talking about

952
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,839
secondary marks it really when

953
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,639
what i mean is that is that people need

954
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:57,038
to be like collectors need a platform

955
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,120
to sell their pipes and there needs to

956
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:02,079
be a third party you know you need

957
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,719
the similar platforms typically will

958
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,879
appraise

959
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,240
these pieces etc that's kind of like the

960
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,559
robust secondary market

961
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,759
and i was hoping that lucan uh you know

962
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,440
salt would be here

963
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,038
unfortunately he had another he had uh

964
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,640
he couldn't make it but you know this is

965
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,798
something he's invested in

966
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,799
glass grab you know need some work it's

967
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:22,158
a decent app but you know it

968
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,519
kind of fulfills some of this um but

969
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,840
uh you know i just wanted to be clear

970
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,440
about what what would actually like

971
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,879
allow these pipes to actually appreciate

972
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,880
in value

973
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,240
truly well one of the things that helps

974
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,240
us right

975
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,359
now is um you know some of the big

976
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,798
players in the

977
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,599
in the artistic scene uh have to embrace

978
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,079
what we're doing

979
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,839
and so to do that um we're you know this

980
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,599
tv stuff that's going on

981
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,519
you guys all saw the show blown away

982
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,918
that just came out that brings

983
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,278
light on the glass itself and now with

984
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,120
our show coming out we are

985
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,319
involving the pilschuck glass school

986
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,558
which is an incredible

987
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,000
resource for all glass artists we're

988
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,480
also involving uh the

989
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,119
corning museum of glass they've taken in

990
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,880
their first

991
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,558
pipe about a year and a half ago into

992
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,480
the museum collection

993
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,720
so that brings legitimacy to what we're

994
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,159
doing by involving them in the tv show

995
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,600
now that we're doing uh you know

996
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,200
and we're gonna give a residency to one

997
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,959
of the artists and

998
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,440
just just bringing light from those

999
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,519
giant collectors and the bigger eyes on

1000
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,720
on just you know that that kind of a

1001
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,399
thing i think that it

1002
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,720
that we need to morph it and there needs

1003
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:26,959
to be people that that bring these two

1004
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,360
worlds together

1005
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,278
so that that that is part of what we're

1006
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,038
doing and it's all about

1007
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,038
creating value in the space like i said

1008
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,960
that one bong that i make that goes to

1009
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:37,839
one dude and he breaks it in the fire or

1010
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,079
whatever

1011
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,240
then it never gets seen uh so some of

1012
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:45,439
these pieces need to

1013
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,798
need to be you know legacy and and

1014
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,000
and documented and things like that

1015
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,000
that's how we do that's why we're doing

1016
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,440
so much video and photo and

1017
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,038
stuff like that of all the pieces coming

1018
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,159
out because it documents it it brings

1019
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,960
historical

1020
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,760
value to it i think we're just too early

1021
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,890
for that idea dave

1022
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,369
story of my life

1023
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,370
[Laughter]

1024
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,038
so you know dave coming into class like

1025
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,399
right after uh operation pipe dreams

1026
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:11,599
you know you weren't too far behind that

1027
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:13,278
i've got to ask were you either a

1028
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:14,079
masochist or did you just basically look

1029
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:15,200
at saying

1030
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,558
there's no way they're holding this

1031
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,519
thing down there's no way we're going to

1032
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:18,720
stop

1033
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,000
the other progression that's going to

1034
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
happen and artists should never be

1035
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,839
punished

1036
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,200
you know i know you've come out from a

1037
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,038
little bit different perspective as far

1038
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,798
as you know creating grav as a brand and

1039
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,240
creating something that uh isn't you

1040
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,558
know necessarily hand blown but

1041
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,000
you know bringing glass to the masses uh

1042
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:32,558
you know what was your catalyst to say

1043
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,640
okay like

1044
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,678
i've heard the stories i'm still getting

1045
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,840
involved in this and

1046
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,960
no one can tell me what to do with

1047
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:42,879
paraphernalia

1048
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,319
um yeah no it's it was o4 i didn't get

1049
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,919
into this actually until

1050
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:50,319
uh april though four and you know

1051
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,759
i was just it was 24 at the time so i

1052
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,000
didn't really know any better it was

1053
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,919
more

1054
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,599
of a hey you know i'm nobody you know

1055
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,159
when you're the size that

1056
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,599
jason was at the time then you know

1057
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,960
you're you're going to get noticed i

1058
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,519
knew i could fly under the radar long

1059
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,000
enough to

1060
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,278
not matter to anybody um you know but of

1061
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,519
course i called the

1062
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,480
you know the uh you know the lawyers

1063
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,199
that were prosecuted

1064
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,240
or defending um paraphernalia cases

1065
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,559
across the country

1066
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,918
and you know the advice was you know

1067
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:18,960
find another job

1068
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,158
and it's it's it was illegal you know

1069
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,838
technically today

1070
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,919
you know just you know for everyone's

1071
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,679
edification um

1072
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,918
you know the federal paraphernalia act

1073
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,838
has a

1074
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,598
has an exemption for states that have

1075
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,199
asso that have legalized the substance

1076
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,399
associated with paraphernalia so

1077
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,398
technically in california and colorado

1078
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,719
and washington or all of the legal

1079
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:43,918
markets including the medical markets

1080
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:47,678
a bong is legal federally legal

1081
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:49,358
um so you know they in fact they're

1082
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,838
you with you on that i gotta argue with

1083
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,838
you on that it's in this in this

1084
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,199
scenario right now i haven't seen

1085
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:58,559
anything came from

1086
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,239
any you know um federal laws

1087
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,480
that that that are any different than

1088
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,598
the ones that were incorporated in 1991

1089
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,000
by federal judge

1090
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,599
william rehnquist designating that that

1091
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,119
what we make is a bong

1092
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,960
and that it's only to be used for

1093
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,760
cannabis consumption

1094
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,400
even though it is legal in these states

1095
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,320
um

1096
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,079
it's not on a federal level and what i

1097
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,400
would do in section e

1098
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,079
in section e of that law it specifically

1099
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,280
says that there is an exemption for

1100
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,680
states that legalize the substance

1101
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,000
associated with a paraphernalia

1102
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,159
and we challenge that yeah i mean i mean

1103
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,400
i'm i mean i'm more than interested in

1104
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:34,239
understanding it and also i mean just

1105
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,800
fyi i have a license

1106
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,639
to create cannabis paraphernalia they

1107
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,560
actually call it drug paraphernalia

1108
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,838
in the city of las vegas so i have a

1109
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:43,599
license to do that

1110
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,880
but what i'm being told at the moment is

1111
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,200
the feds trump

1112
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,280
everything and i haven't seen you know

1113
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,159
any kind of federal anything that's that

1114
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,760
that allows cannabis and if it does that

1115
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,440
means that we can go to the bank with it

1116
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,359
currently i just got shut off of paypal

1117
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,039
the other day before about a week before

1118
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,119
that they shot me off of shopify for the

1119
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:03,279
umpteenth time for selling glass

1120
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,838
cbd is allowed to be sold but glass is

1121
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,680
not um you know i mean i'm i'm pretty up

1122
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:08,799
on the laws right now i'd love to talk

1123
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,319
in another

1124
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,640
scenario where you can kind of get me

1125
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,400
updated on what you know

1126
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:15,759
um i know there's a couple specialty

1127
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,920
lawyers out there that deal in the

1128
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,880
car you know the paraphernalia scenario

1129
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,440
but you know

1130
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,240
just be aware you know i got arrested on

1131
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,200
federal rap

1132
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,319
and it's nothing of that law that i know

1133
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,319
has changed yeah and

1134
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,480
i'd love to understand if there has been

1135
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,119
change but to be clear there's no in the

1136
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,280
clear here

1137
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,240
right like i'm not like let's all go

1138
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,519
make bongs

1139
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,879
um but the but the fact is that there

1140
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,239
you know there is a little bit of light

1141
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,039
in the tunnel but it doesn't change the

1142
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,479
fact that like

1143
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,400
these these laws you know the fact that

1144
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,079
there is a pair of nail on the books

1145
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,440
is going to be along like there there

1146
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,720
will be federally

1147
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,720
you know descheduled or decriminalized

1148
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:55,519
cannabis before that paraphernalia

1149
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,239
law you know gets gets uh you know falls

1150
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,440
off

1151
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:01,279
um and uh and so i mean yeah that's

1152
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,480
that's kind of a fight that i've been

1153
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,160
fighting since

1154
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,838
uh 2010 when ncia was created and

1155
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,838
you know we started drafting the

1156
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,358
amendment 64 in colorado because it was

1157
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,599
really important to get

1158
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:17,920
the the language into the law that

1159
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:20,160
explicitly says that paraphernalia

1160
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,280
in this state is legal because if it

1161
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,759
didn't say that

1162
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,800
then federally the you know they'd be

1163
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,440
able to continue to

1164
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,480
to go after vanilla um and you know and

1165
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,559
since then you know

1166
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,000
most states ninety percent of them that

1167
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,320
have published

1168
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,519
laws have uh have followed suit and

1169
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,079
added a peripheral piece of

1170
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,920
paraphernalia

1171
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,440
language in there um because of that

1172
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,680
work the ncia did

1173
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,440
um back in 2010 it was a big deal

1174
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,199
yeah i mean believe me i i always think

1175
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,200
i'm thinking myself as that frog

1176
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,399
that you know i'm standing on the frying

1177
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,239
pan and um

1178
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,760
you know just wondering when it's going

1179
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,679
to burn me basically

1180
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,359
so you know i mean even to this day like

1181
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,399
i said i'm still getting shut down left

1182
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,440
and right

1183
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,639
for selling bongs and so um

1184
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,159
you know it's just about right now about

1185
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,480
navigating the space and staying

1186
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:06,480
positive

1187
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,239
yeah i think that's the absurdity of

1188
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,440
some of these laws that are still in the

1189
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,879
books is crazy

1190
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,679
you know as someone that came out of the

1191
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,640
hydro industry for quite a few years

1192
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,759
you know how to deal with the same

1193
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,799
things you guys deal with where for

1194
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,000
years it was like you know it's on a

1195
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,519
bong it's a water pipe

1196
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,760
you know anyone that came into my stores

1197
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:25,280
for a long time the uh the mantra was

1198
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,640
oh no we're here for tomatoes and

1199
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,440
peppers you know we're not here for

1200
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,639
cannabis growing

1201
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,838
which obviously is just you know

1202
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:33,838
completely fictitious when i hit a point

1203
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,960
the word bong you know we we think now

1204
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,440
oh we're all good

1205
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,838
you know and we can say it now and i and

1206
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,320
i've thought that for the past 12 years

1207
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:47,519
i've been full throttle hashtagging the

1208
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,440
word bong

1209
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:50,880
cannabis blah blah blah and now what

1210
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,000
i've realized

1211
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,720
is that uh what i've realized is that

1212
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,800
um i had to go back recently and scrub

1213
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,639
every single post i've ever done

1214
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,800
screw up every single invoice i'm

1215
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:05,039
writing on my quickbooks programs

1216
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,079
scrub it all and change my word around

1217
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,960
the tube

1218
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,640
not not put the word pipe i'm in

1219
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,240
everything and then dave i'm sure you're

1220
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,199
pretty versed in all this your

1221
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,039
business i mean swamps mine i'm sure

1222
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,838
your volume of sales

1223
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,639
um are much higher than mine on a on a

1224
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:22,639
yearly

1225
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,960
and so i know that you you know you have

1226
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,598
uh you know

1227
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,000
knowledge of this space but my you know

1228
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,000
i thought

1229
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
i did too i just recently just realized

1230
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,119
why i was getting hemmed up so much

1231
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,400
and so it's you know just being

1232
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,800
connected to these hashtags and these

1233
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,800
algorithms that

1234
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,839
that blocked me out and so recently i'm

1235
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,839
just kind of

1236
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,599
going back scrubbing everything and just

1237
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,159
trying to paper it up nicely as i go

1238
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,039
forward

1239
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,639
soft disney style sell some t-shirts

1240
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,320
bring light to the brand

1241
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,118
and then hopefully i can sell the glass

1242
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,119
on the back end

1243
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,679
so sarah 420 sciences what are you guys

1244
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,119
doing these days to uh

1245
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:00,078
to make sure you're staying compliant to

1246
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,760
make sure that you know you're putting

1247
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,560
out really cool art that uh the people

1248
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,160
are seeing

1249
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:05,599
like what is the uh like when you guys

1250
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:06,960
internally sit around and try to figure

1251
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,800
out how to grow the business

1252
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,720
you know what do you think about as far

1253
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,920
as all these different concerns and then

1254
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,959
what do you think about as far as how to

1255
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,960
generate

1256
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,960
new interest in just glass in general

1257
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:26,239
oh geez that's a big question um i mean

1258
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:26,239
we still keep it super clean very safe

1259
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,400
you know like as jason was talking about

1260
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,318
it's

1261
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,680
i try to learn from all those that came

1262
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,800
before me

1263
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:39,118
and understand what

1264
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,640
what we're doing still does skirt a lot

1265
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,519
of laws

1266
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,358
even though it might feel safe most of

1267
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,719
the time

1268
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:48,719
there we're you know we're always

1269
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,358
looking over our shoulder i guess right

1270
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,880
um

1271
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:58,078
what are we doing i mean we got kicked

1272
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,000
off instagram

1273
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,079
we yeah right now we're totally d

1274
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,119
platformed almost we got deleted from

1275
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,519
youtube

1276
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,599
we got kicked off instagram over and

1277
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,239
over again just grab your hashtags

1278
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,519
scrub your hashtag yeah remember what

1279
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,159
i'm telling you right now it's something

1280
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:17,358
that i've just learned

1281
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:20,078
it's frustrating um

1282
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,639
but yeah we love partnering with artists

1283
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,440
um

1284
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,719
on branded merchandise paying them a

1285
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,720
royalty

1286
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:31,358
and um bringing them into like this

1287
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,919
to into a new market right and so like

1288
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:35,119
doing

1289
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,240
um collaborations with rolling trays and

1290
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,440
stash jars

1291
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:43,279
and grinders and stuff like that and

1292
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,599
um that's been one of my favorite things

1293
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,519
one of gary's favorite things is

1294
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,119
you know making friends with these guys

1295
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:52,639
and making money together

1296
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,920
like we love it um

1297
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,318
i don't know if that answers your

1298
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,400
question but yeah no it does it's

1299
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:59,920
really helpful so you know let's talk

1300
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,358
about you know between all this talk

1301
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,200
about the art these days and

1302
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:04,799
obviously you know the industry that is

1303
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,919
still massive when i say the instrument

1304
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,519
in the glass industry

1305
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,200
i remember the one year the hydroponics

1306
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:09,679
industry and champs were actually had a

1307
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:11,598
um

1308
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,279
a show at the same time in vegas we

1309
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,680
ended up just dropping the curtain and

1310
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,839
sharing the uh sharing the space 9000

1311
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,118
2009 it was such a fun weekend was like

1312
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:19,519
two different parts of the industry that

1313
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,800
were

1314
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,559
you know facing from the same challenge

1315
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,280
just all came together it was

1316
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,400
awesome but um you know from the

1317
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,560
artistic side

1318
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,400
like i i don't get to see nearly as much

1319
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,000
as i used to you know previously

1320
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,358
but who out there is just crushing like

1321
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,719
who's putting out like the best head

1322
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:35,920
pieces like who's playing stuff when you

1323
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,959
guys see it and you go to shows or

1324
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,000
you're subjecting friends that are

1325
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,199
blowers

a lot more self-promotion in a world

that's changed from

1394
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,880
you know just pedaling over to the head

1395

changers they put a lot of different

1400
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,599
eyes on what we're doing and um kind of

1401
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,160
created a whole new

1402
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,838
little world out of you know this this

1403
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:17,598
pointillism stuff that they do and it

1404
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,119
just takes weeks to make a little

1405
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,039
pendant or something you know and they

1406
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,400
put all this time in it

1407
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,838
and it's kind of that whisker and uh

1408
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,440
you know what painting with the whisker

1409
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,920
in the glass jar kind of a

1410
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,679
thing you know where they they have to

1411
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,358
think it out and take this meticulous

1412
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:35,519
process oriented steps and

1413
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,358
they they really did some cool stuff

1414
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:37,920
with the flame working movement and i

1415
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:40,719
also go

1416
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,480
always go back to bob bob's still you

1417
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:43,118
know one of the most imaginative people

1418
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,039
in the space

1419
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,480
and anybody whether it's elbow or you

1420
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,039
know slinger or anybody that's around

1421
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,599
him

1422
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,318
um picks that up and kind of energizes

1423
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,519
off that so

1424
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:53,440
you know you have to always watch what

1425
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:53,920
bob and bob's team's doing the camerons

1426
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,559

there's just some really really

1430
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,800
imaginative stuff and in the end for me

1431
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,960
it's changing color the more you smoke

1432

1434
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,199
little bit different view and different

1435
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,159

different metals for a long time that

1448
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,039
other people weren't using

1449

hottest

1453
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,800
newest most fucking epic shit going on

1454
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,679
is out of germany

1455
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,800
it's a guy named hans iddick glass house

1456
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,879
fair time

1457
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,880
i'm watching him on torch talk and you

1458
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,039
can see he's created something

1459
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,240
in this borosilicate that's never ever

1460
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,199
been done before

1461
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,078
and he's selling it to us and it's a

1462
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,799
it's a technique

1463
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,760
it's a it's a it's it's a groundbreaking

1464
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,440
thing where we can put

1465
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,040
full photos inside of the glass and it's

1466
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,318
in the borah silica glass we've been

1467
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:11,920
able to do it with soft glass in the

1468
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:12,800
past but not with borah silicon so he's

1469
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,480
created a

1470
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,560
a powder technique that he's put the

1471
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,400
powders on the papers and we can

1472
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,159
apply it onto the glass and and that's

1473
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,760
the technique that i'm using now for the

1474
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:25,358
whole new i'm i'm i'm

how do you guys think about the industry

1510
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,480
i mean for me i i definitely think to

1511
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,838
your aftermarket uh discussion earlier

1512
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,159
there's definitely gonna be you know

1513
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,199
pieces of art that uh that 20 years 30

1514
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:32,239
years from now people are going to look

1515
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,439
back on though those things are

1516
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:35,358
absolutely priceless

1517
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,119
especially because as you know uh jason

1518
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:38,400
alluded to earlier so many of the best

1519
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,318
pieces out there in this world have

1520
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,000
gotten broken in the last 30 years

1521
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:43,440
that uh it's tragic that some of the

1522
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,239
best ones out there just are gone

1523
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,079
forever

1524
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,439
so you know what are you guys thinking

1525
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,318
about as far as collaboration

1526
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,280
a lot of good bombs go to heaven no

1527
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:52,480
doubt no doubt

1528
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,760
but how do you guys think about the

1529
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,639
collecting game or is that you know

1530
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,920
something that you don't even think

1531
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:57,519
about and just think the next amazing

1532
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,880
piece will be created next month so

1533
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:00,318
so what do i worry about are you

1534
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,680
actually out there actively collecting

1535
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:04,159
pieces

1536
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,039
oh i always actively collect i'm i'm not

1537
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:07,118
uh you know

1538
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:09,679

00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,119
back in 2007 i was like underwater with

1540

whole thing down and then

1542
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,639
started making tasters and uh you know

1543
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,800
trying to turn everything around and so

1544
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,000
my uh my mantra for the last 10 years

1545
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,640

1547
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,159

1548
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,599
i can possibly from every artist that i

1549
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,399

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,079
collector world right now is

1563
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,000
they go out and it's an expression of

1564
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,760
them if they roll in with the

1565

1652
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:49,838
and that piece was amazing to uh to

1653
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,119
carry around as well and i used to

1654
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:52,400
whenever i had friends over it always

1655
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,838
make sure i had two tubes so i wouldn't

1656
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,800
be the person that was packing bowls and

1657
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,400
not passing

1658
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,559
and uh make sure someone else you know

1659
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,680
to just you know make sure i was cordial

1660
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,680
making sure that the other person would

1661
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,039
have a pack ripper

1662
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,519
waiting for them as well at all times

1663
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:07,920
but i usually uh i usually keep

1664
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,519
your tube as the one that was mine and

1665
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,440
uh past the other wood block once it's

1666
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,039
more of a novelty to the others

1667
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,720
but uh but i wish i still had a glass

1668
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,159
collection i wish that you know

1669
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,919
i wish i had a lot of the stuff that was

1670
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,679
offered to me back you know in the late

1671
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,880
90s where a lot of it wasn't even pipes

1672
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:22,318
it was a lot of people coming out of the

1673
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,280
stock grass shop they were making really

1674
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:25,279
creative things

1675
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,200
that were you know non-pipes that were

1676
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,640
just great artwork that uh you know

1677
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,318
starting off with marbles and starting

1678
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:34,078
off with jars and then progressing from

1679
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:34,079
there just to really really unique stuff

1680
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:37,519
sure that's part of the magic of the

1681
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,800
whole collectibility is like the bitcoin

1682
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:41,599
thing you don't want to miss out

1683
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,880
you know definitely definitely and as i

1684
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,720
said you know i've lost

1685
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,480
largely kind of migrated away from being

1686
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:47,679
involved in that part of the industry

1687
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,440
you know that was kind of where i got my

1688
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:50,799
start in the early 90s as far as you

1689
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,440
know bringing stuff out on tour

1690
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,160
that you guys are producing um so hey

1691
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,119

1692
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:56,558

blowing in the glass um

1698
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,318
just the glass industry in general we've

1699
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:08,400
got dave daley from grab we've got uh

1700
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:11,119
jason harris from jerome baker designs

1701

and sarah todd from uh from 20 science

1702
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,760
we are going to open up the room a

1703
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:16,000
little bit some questions so

1704
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,359
eric who is a massachusetts uh person

1705
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,880
who's up here on stage and has been

1706
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:19,598
involved in massachusetts campus for

1707
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,960
years

1708
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,000
uh derek do you have any questions for

1709
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,358
anyone on the panel or you just want to

1710
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,838
say hello what's going on

1711
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,279
i do have a general question for glass

1712
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:30,318
and i'm not sure if

1713
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,680
this is uh the right room for it but

1714
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:36,639
in massachusetts the testing delays are

1715
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:38,078
between like 45 and 50 days and it's

1716
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:39,759
resulting in

1717
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,440
like a deterioration in some of the

1718
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,040
quality of the cannabis that by the time

1719
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,280
it gets sold on the stores

1720
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:46,639
and you know i don't think the mylar

1721
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,880
bags are great for it

1722
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:50,078
and some of the chinese glasses like

1723
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,200
porous and

1724
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,760
uh i american glass seems to be

1725
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:56,639
too expensive but do you have any

1726
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,440
suggestions

1727
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:00,960
or recommendations uh or anything that

1728
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,838
we can do to kind of help it

1729
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:06,000
besides putting like nitro in there or

1730
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:07,599
something

1731
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,358
done a decent amount of testing why

1732
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,559
besides putting nitro in there

1733
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:12,960
why do you not want to put nice row in

1734
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,798
there well i that was just one

1735
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,838
suggestion that one person threw out

1736
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:16,639
there and i didn't know if that's the

1737
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:18,480
only option

1738
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,159
or i mean i don't have anything against

1739
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,159
it i was just wondering if there's any

1740
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,639
any recommendations or what people think

1741
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:27,358
about this

1742
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:27,759
yeah i would seal it in a borosilicate

1743
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:30,000
uh

1744
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,880
uh some sort of blue silica canisters

1745
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,798
with ground joint lids on you can

1746
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,480
you know put your nitro in there so it

1747
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:37,679
sits and holds for your time but maybe

1748
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,199
maybe putting nitro in

1749
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:42,639
might be bad for it when you pop it back

1750
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:42,639
open for testing i'm not sure

1751
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,480
i do know if you figure it out you give

1752
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,838
me specs on it let me quote your job

1753
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,599
because i make everything in glass

1754
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:50,558
including all the biggest rigs in vegas

1755
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,000

day he had some bongs get stolen

1775

1787
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,480
part of

fulfillment of

1879
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:48,239
of of being you know the peace that it

1880
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:48,719
is because it is breakable and things do

1881
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:50,639
happen

1882
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,798
and it should be protected in a certain

1883
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:52,798
way

1884
00:59:55,358 --> 01:00:00,719

this has been really great it's uh

1894
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:19,440

the old days

1896
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,920

1899
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:33,358
uh in oregon is fixing some old bus

1900
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,119
that we lived in on tour for a while and

1901
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:36,798
he got me to commission the piece that's

1902
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,599
in my picture

1903
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:40,079
which uh bob made me in the winner of

1904
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:42,318
89.90

1905
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:44,480
i think he brought it to me actually at

1906
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:48,159
the start of spring tour

1907
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:51,280
uh in like atlanta or someplace in 90.

1908
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:54,000
anyway this thing was all over tour

1909
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,240
got broken at some point bob fixed it

1910
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,280
even better than it was so

1911
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:58,879
so many things you guys were talking

1912
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,480
about and then it was lost for more than

1913
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,760
20 years

1914
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,760
and it just recently came back

1915
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,359
that's awesome yeah i remember i

1916
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,159
remember bringing a piece to bob that

1917
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:12,000
was uh

1918
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:13,598
like jason was referring to earlier it

1919
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,358
was a steamroller at the time was the

1920
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,880
biggest steamroller bobbin ever produced

1921
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,199
it was about

1922
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,798
almost two feet long it was an absolute

1923
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:23,598
monstrosity i remember smuggling

1924
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,880
into shows in seattle in 1994 and how we

1925
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:26,559
got it through security i've got

1926
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,480
no idea but we pulled that thing out on

1927
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,559
the floor like literally every single

1928
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,159
person in like 50 yards is like holy

1929
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:33,280
shit what's that

1930
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:34,558
and i remember when that thing got

1931
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,839
cracked and bringing it back and we're

1932
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,640
like is there anything that can be done

1933
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:37,920
with this thing

1934
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,519
it's the fact you've got one that

1935
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,559
actually you know made it and uh

1936
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:42,000
survived

1937
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,519
i always think about like how many pipes

1938
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,639
got broken in people's laps getting out

1939
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:46,000
of their cars

1940
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:48,239
and just like that being like this like

1941
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,358
the number one way of like uh of pipes

1942
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:51,039
getting destroyed

1943
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:53,119
because rad you've got one that's like

1944
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:54,880
survived and has been battle tested like

1945
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,960
that

1946
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,039
yeah i was still bombed when some random

1947
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,559
i mean i smoked this thing with hundreds

1948
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,079
of people on tour it was just some

1949
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:04,559
random guy

1950
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,880
and uh i think he was drunk and broke a

1951
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:09,920
leg off and man i was

1952
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,559
i was flipping out then i talked to bob

1953
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,240
and

1954
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:16,319
bob was like oh man all all i need is

1955
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:18,000
cash glass and the gas

1956
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:19,440
and i'll fix it right up for you and he

1957
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,119
actually made it better so

1958
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,440
wicked cool hey to both you and

1959
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,160
ross you know the

1960
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:29,039
[Music]

1961
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,558
this this secondary market concept is i

1962
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,839
can't stress the importance of it like

1963
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,640
you know the collectors are going to be

1964
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:36,400
the ones that drive the demand and

1965
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:38,000
the artists are going to be the ones

1966
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,599
that bless it so

1967
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,280
you know if you have it's those that

1968
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,680
have that you're the artist

1969
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,200
that are going to be able to drive that

1970
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:46,719
opportunity the most right if the

1971
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:48,639
artists are willing to

1972
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:50,318
put credence to their work to you know

1973
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,639
to verify their work

1974
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:54,400
and then you know which which would

1975
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:56,639
inevitably give way to a platform

1976
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,079
that would um you know that would

1977
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,879
support you know

1978
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:02,400
appraisals and you know and truly

1979
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,119
secondary sales

1980
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,519
then then you have an immediate platform

1981
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,039
um

1982
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:08,400
but you have to centralize it and the

1983
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,680
only way to centralize it is to get all

1984
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,960
the artists to agree

1985
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:12,399
hey this is the place where i'm going to

1986
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,960
send people this is where i'm going to

1987
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,079
be

1988
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:19,358
verifying my work and then

1989
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,359
the people come out of the woodwork

1990
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:25,759
so how do you go about um getting

1991
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,318
certification on things that are

1992
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,760
probably like 15 20 25 years old dave

1993
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,838
you know is there an authentication

1994
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,760
process i mean a lot of the artists

1995
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:35,838
like jason i gotta ask you like do you

1996
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,039
remember every piece you ever made

1997
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:38,880
you gotta hope the artist wasn't too

1998
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,640
stoned i mean i can tell i've had this

1999
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,880
conversation with with salt

2000
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:44,400
multiple times and he promises he

2001
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,559
remembers every single

2002
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,400
product he ever made and i believe that

2003
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,000
yeah i know i know every piece i've ever

2004
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,680
made i know every piece i've ever made

2005
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,400
every piece my team's ever made every

2006
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,838
piece with my

2007
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:58,639
name on it ever made and and and

2008
01:03:55,838 --> 01:04:00,558
like i said there's there's i think i

2009
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:01,679
think most of these guys do especially

2010
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,200
from the old times you're going to be

2011
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:05,038
able to tell especially if you can

2012
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:06,879
get the the direct you know sign off

2013
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,760
from the artist if it's real or not

2014
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,720
and um you know again you know check out

2015
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,000
what i told you

2016
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:14,318
agc agc.agcguild.org and that that has

2017
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,239
that

2018
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:17,838
direct connection to the artist and also

2019
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:20,078
facebook does as well

2020
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:21,599
if you get documentation and you connect

2021
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,359
with the artist i mean i mean nowadays

2022
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,440
it's kind of like so different because

2023
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:27,119
of the social media when we started

2024
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,039
there was no internet

2025
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,880
you know and so so now you can go

2026
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,240
directly to the artist and avoid the

2027
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,760
gallery and so that kind of

2028
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:37,679
is a big deal and um you know

2029
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,960
some artists deal direct with the public

2030
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:40,159
some artists

2031
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,400
to send everything through stores and

2032
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:44,798
galleries and shows

2033
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,720
and um but you can connect directly with

2034
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,000
the artist you can get a certification

2035
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:49,679
from an artist and as long as you have

2036
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,559
documentation like that that's the first

2037
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:53,440
step

2038
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,720
signatures are great on the pieces um

2039
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,039
and when you when you see that

2040
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:58,879
that your favorite glass makers come

2041
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,480
into town or has a shirt

2042
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,559
go somewhere you can go bring your

2043
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,719
pieces to them and have them sign it

2044
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,240
document that with a picture and

2045
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:08,000
understand that you're

2046
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:09,679
you know creating legacy with the pieces

2047
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,280
that you have it's like famous guitars

2048
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:12,960
or anything else it needs to be

2049
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,400
somehow documented so when it goes into

2050
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,000
the pawn shop

2051
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,079
you know you have all this certification

2052
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,159
blah blah blah wrapped around it i mean

2053
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:23,839
it's pretty logical so you know that's

2054
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:23,838
that should be taken care of

2055
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,079
i'll say about the memory thing bob sure

2056
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:30,639
as fact remember this piece when

2057
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,079
you know it reappeared after 20 some

2058
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:33,679
years and

2059
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,519
he was telling me stuff i didn't even

2060
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,038
remember about how he made it and when

2061
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:40,400
and everything

2062
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,480
that's a snotty yeah

2063
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,200
yeah it's something for me and the

2064
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:48,240
winner of 89.90

2065
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:50,159
i uh and and everybody everybody who has

2066
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:52,959
the bob pieces must know

2067
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:54,879
you have to know that that bob is

2068
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,838
getting channeled and this is from bob's

2069
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,440
mouth is that

2070
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:58,880
the pieces that he's making are being

2071
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,200
channeled through something and this

2072
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,960
portal pops him out of his hands

2073
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:05,118
and that's your key to the spaceship

2074
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,920
when this thing comes down and lands

2075
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:08,400
you're gonna be able to

2076
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,680
get in with that into the door um so

2077
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,240
make sure you have your

2078
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:14,798
piece on you at all times yeah man and

2079
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:16,318
my favorite part of like bob's story is

2080
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:17,920
you know the connection to the culture

2081
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:19,519
as someone that was raised by dead heads

2082
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,760
that grew up listening to the music

2083
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,038
and you know saw the surviving members

2084
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,359
as much as i could

2085
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,079
up until you know the recent um project

2086
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:28,639
but

2087
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,240
i've always connected cannabis and the

2088
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,558
grateful dead but to

2089
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,838
learn the backstory of bob you know

2090
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:36,480
pulling up to lie

2091
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:38,000
blowing glass bringing pieces to sell

2092
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,000
you know it kind of being really like

2093
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,838
the first resounding like

2094
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,920
you know um artist in the scene and like

2095
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:48,318
especially in terms of like using fume

2096
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,720
and really killing it in that regard

2097
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:51,759
um and being someone that loves few

2098
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:53,679
artists myself

2099
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,880
people like makabi and you know even

2100
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:56,639
like what banjo does

2101
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,798
and uh you know all these different

2102
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:02,078
dudes that are just killing it right now

2103
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:03,358
um you know they're all inspired by bob

2104
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,000
and it's really cool

2105
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:06,400
to still have basically the godfather of

2106
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,480
like

2107
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,079
the sea and that's connected to my

2108
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,559
favorite band and the whole world

2109
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,000
still around creating it's like i just

2110
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:17,119
feel lucky to be around at this

2111
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,679
time basically yeah i mean we are

2112
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,599
blessed

2113
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:21,519
especially to to know it and acknowledge

2114
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:23,519
it and be part of it it's um

2115
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:24,639
it's gonna go you know it's gonna it's

2116
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,038
changed the world

2117
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:28,879
it's changed the glass medium i mean

2118
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,960
it's such a cool important part of

2119
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:33,119
legalization of cannabis and

2120
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,358
you know it's really cool and bob is you

2121
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:37,760
know the pinnacle of the wizardry of

2122
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:39,279
this whole thing for sure

2123
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,960
yeah i remember going to barter fair in

2124
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,559
1995 with bob

2125
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,079
and like getting to spend you know two

2126
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,519
days of barter fair when like you know

2127
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,359
harvest was just coming down in southern

2128
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,880
oregon and northern california

2129
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:50,480
and literally just watching him get

2130
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,000
absolutely mobbed by everyone that's

2131
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,960
just like willing to trade whatever they

2132
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,639
just brought down

2133
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,000
it's really any pieces that bob had on

2134
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:57,199
hand and between him and the rest of the

2135
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,239
shop there was probably like three or

2136
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,279
four hundred pieces they brought to

2137
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:01,118
barter fair

2138
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,798
and that used to be such a cool festival

2139
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,798
or even called a festival just

2140
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:06,239

glass blowers getting together like

01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:59,760
yeah um what can you share

2234
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,960
i don't know i was thinking about

2235
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,680
throwing the whole catalog in the

2236
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,350
garbage

2237
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:05,039
[Music]

2238
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:07,760
[Laughter]

2239
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:07,760
classic

2240
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:16,960
no i uh grav is

2241
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,560
um you know my my entire singular focus

2242
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,119
as you know rob and i have discussed

2243
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,480
you know recently is is on single-use

2244
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:24,319
cannabis consumption so

2245
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:27,119
you know we're really focused on our

2246
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:29,439
glass joint project in california

2247
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:31,599
we're going to start rolling that out to

2248
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:33,519
the rest of the country

2249
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:36,159
and you know that's that's really

2250
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:39,440
exciting work it's not a perfect product

2251
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:41,679
i'm the first to admit that but

2252
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:43,359
i'm really bullish on single-use

2253
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:43,920
cannabis consumption specifically in

2254
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,000
glass

2255
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,920
so i think that you know grav has the

2256
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,800
right to win in that category so

2257
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,199
laser focus there second is you know

2258
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,920
just

2259
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:55,519
is you know literally throwing half the

2260
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,560
catalog in trash i think it's

2261
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:02,000
you know old it's got it needs a lot of

2262
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:04,320
a lot of refreshing and so we are

2263
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,679
in the trenches of working out what

2264
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:06,559
makes sense and what doesn't in the

2265
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,600
future

2266
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:12,880
um you know cannabis is moving fast and

2267
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,239
you know there's a lot of um

2268
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,920
you know it's going to continue to move

2269
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:17,759
faster and you know

2270
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,279
in uh and i think that there's going to

2271
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,840
be massive movement on a federal level

2272
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:23,439
in the next

2273
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:26,800
you know year if not several years um

2274
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:28,079
which is just going to push got it it's

2275
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,119
going to push headshots into a weird

2276
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:31,760
place potentially

2277
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:33,519
um and so you know i just i think about

2278
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,679
that a lot and i think about where

2279
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,280
um where the glass game is going to go

2280
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:38,880
all of these artists that are kind of in

2281
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:41,599
the middle tier that are not

2282
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,159
you know jason harris dronebaker they're

2283
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,239
not

2284
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:45,359
salt you know that's that's going to be

2285
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:48,718
really tough it's going to be tough to

2286
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:50,238
survive um so

2287
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:52,000
you know what's next for grab i think

2288
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:53,599
that we just you know look i'm gonna do

2289
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,800
the same thing i've been doing

2290
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,199
for the last 17 years and keep my head

2291
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,520
down

2292
01:12:57,198 --> 01:13:01,279
and keep you know every turn i think

2293
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:05,840
that there's not something you know

2294
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:05,840
i'm going to get bored and i just don't

2295
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,079
so before i invite megan or adam to

2296
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,360
speak here in just a second

2297
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,198
you want to plug what you're doing with

2298
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:14,559
uh with your glass joints as well

2299
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:15,678
because it's such a novel concept and

2300
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,480
there's very few people out there that

2301
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,760
are really doing it and

2302
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:19,519
you've done a really nice launch of the

2303
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,800
california market you want to talk about

2304
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:23,280
what you're doing with glass joints and

2305
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:26,560
single serving there

2306
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:28,158
yeah so for the for those of you that

2307
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,679
don't know what a glass joint is it's

2308
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:30,960
because we've made up the term it

2309
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,039
doesn't actually exist

2310
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,560
it's a iteration of the glass blunt

2311
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,880
which is a slider which is

2312
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,320
you know effectively a tube that is

2313
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,560
loaded with flour and then

2314
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:42,158
another tube that would that slides into

2315
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,199
the interior of that tube that has a

2316
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:44,879
restriction

2317
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:46,319
in it that prevents the flower from

2318
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,400
sucking into your mouth

2319
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:49,439
and then you smoke it not dissimilar to

2320
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:52,399
a real joint

2321
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:52,719
but as you light it and you burn it down

2322
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:54,639
you

2323
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,840
push the ash out with the tube that's in

2324
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:59,600
the inside

2325
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:02,159
um so it like a push pop

2326
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:04,000
yeah exactly exactly like a push pop so

2327
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:06,319
you know if you smoke it the right way

2328
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,279
you get a really even cherry that stays

2329
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:08,719
lit the whole time

2330
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:10,559
as long as you're pushing out the ash if

2331
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,239
you try to suck it all down you know you

2332
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,960
end up losing the the

2333
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:16,158
the the cherry and it's a less than

2334
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,600
ideal experience

2335
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:19,439
so it takes a little bit of tweaking and

2336
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,239
it's you know more of a you know

2337
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:22,719
uh you know middle middle tier smoker uh

2338
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:24,879
from a

2339
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,319
experienced level to uh to really get it

2340
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,279
but um

2341
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:28,960
you know and that's what we're seeing in

2342
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:30,479
market in california is that you know

2343
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,760
it's getting adopted and stick and

2344
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:34,238
sticking with about 20

2345
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,520
of people to try it and i think we're

2346
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:36,959
losing a lot of people that just want to

2347
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,239
refill it because the biggest heavy

2348
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,000
lifting that we have to do is convince

2349
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:41,359
people to throw away their glass

2350
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,520
so you know i'm the kind of the jerome

2351
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:44,880
baker you know jason's antithesis of

2352
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,199
what he's talking about he's

2353
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,719
he wants to make art that lives forever

2354
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:49,599
and i'm trying to make shit that people

2355
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:53,198
throw away

2356
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,880
um so i i don't uh and i think that

2357
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:57,198
there's always gonna be a place for

2358
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,440
the for the high end i believe that you

2359
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:02,000
know that the artistic side of it is

2360
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:03,599
as important or more than you know the

2361
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,800
the throwaway shit that i'm trying to

2362
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,239
pull off so

2363
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,239
you know to be clear for everybody in

2364
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:11,359
the room you know

2365
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:14,799
this is in support of not uh in

2366
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:17,920
uh you know not in combat of the

2367
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,920
the art market

2368
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,920

2386
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,480

2387
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:01,679
thing i just want to say hi to jason

2388
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:03,519

uh thank you rob i'm doing great i'm in

2393
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,479
california and

2394
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:13,920
there's a bit of snow so if the

2395
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:15,359
satellite's not making it all the way

2396
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,279
through apologies

2397
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:19,439
and i'm not sure if you touched on this

2398
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:23,840
but just the idea of

2399
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:27,279
um autographing or a way to sign

2400
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:30,640
the pieces um someone i heard about

2401
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:33,279
infrared scanning and attaching or

2402
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:36,280
minting a token associated with that

2403
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:37,840
in a way that the art piece is both

2404
01:16:36,279 --> 01:16:40,399
authenticated

2405
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,319
but if there is an increase in value of

2406
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:45,519
the token

2407
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:47,279
or the piece or any transfers there's a

2408
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:51,120
way to pay royalties

2409
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:52,559
to both the artist and possibly the

2410
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:54,079
initial investor

2411
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,880
but i just wanted to offer that as an

2412
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,960
idea and just pay love and respect for

2413
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:02,800
all the uh

2414
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,480
builders of these sacred pipes thank you

2415
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,760
right on uh sarah are you hearing

2416
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:07,439
anything about that are you hearing

2417
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,440
about the digital authentication or any

2418
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:11,198
sort of infrared authentication

2419
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:13,439
what are you seeing right now i haven't

2420
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:17,279
but that is a great idea

2421
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:18,879
it sounds like nfts i love it

2422
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:21,039
i was thinking the same thing that's

2423
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:24,319
like this sounds perfect for nft

2424
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:25,679
um yeah that's that's crazy

2425
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:27,039
that uh the people are thinking about

2426
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,000
that right i'm surprised it hasn't been

2427
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:29,760
done already to

2428
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,960
create some sort of authentication again

2429
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,960
there are certain artists that obviously

2430
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,158
had like their own like very unique mark

2431
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,439
that you could always tell whose piece

2432
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:36,799
it was based on just

2433
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:38,319
a certain thing they did anyone that

2434
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,199
looked at they say oh that's so and so

2435
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:41,119
it's just by um

2436
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:43,119
just kind of knowing what their style

2437
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:44,640
was but uh but actually truly

2438
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:45,920
authenticating it i think would be

2439
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,039
really interesting if they could find a

2440
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,279
way to do it

2441
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:50,479
um hey to dave and sarah question for

2442
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:52,800
you guys like um

2443
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:54,639
on the side of like sort of the nexus

2444
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,880
between the um

2445
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,760
the industry especially the artisans on

2446
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,920
the um

2447
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,360
on the extract side you know obviously

2448
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,119
like the whole game with dab rigs

2449
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:04,479
changed so completely once you know

2450
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:06,559
dabbing came out

2451
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:08,158
that you know are you are there people

2452
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,039
that you guys work with or that you know

2453
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:10,399
that

2454
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:11,519
help you think about what you want to do

2455
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:12,399
next simply because of what they're

2456
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,320
coming out with

2457
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:16,000
you know back when for like shatter and

2458
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,880
butter and wax and diamonds first hit

2459
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,640
the market

2460
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,760
you know it completely changed the game

2461
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,039
about how people were thinking about

2462
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,800
what they needed whether it was you know

2463
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:24,158
at the time like titanium nails or

2464
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,480
crystal

2465
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:27,279
and other mediums to to you know start

2466
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:28,639
consuming

2467
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:30,479
but i've got i think there's like a real

2468
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,039
closeness between the real artisans on

2469
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:32,718
the uh

2470
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:34,158
on the extraction side and the glass

2471
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:37,198
people themselves so

2472
01:18:34,158 --> 01:18:37,198
how do you guys look at that game

2473
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:42,960
sarah do you want to take this oh man i

2474
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,920
don't know

2475
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,119
i'm not sure i just have to say hi adam

2476
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,800

2477
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:50,880
who you are i met you back at the

2478
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:55,119
emerald cup like a couple years ago

01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:55,119
i'm so happy to say see you

2480
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,880
i'm just realizing who you were and that

2481
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,239

01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:12,079
are you and was it gary yeah

2483
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:13,519
yeah and that was we were having a

2484
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:16,559
little snack

2485
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:19,120
and uh do it yeah shared a little bit

2486
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,120
i remember that very well yeah it was

2487
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:24,319
very cool meeting you both

2488
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:26,399
and um yeah nice to meet you again here

2489
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:28,559
in this digital space

2490
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,158
ditto sorry to totally sidetrack that

2491
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,000
conversation i just looked at his

2492
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:34,960
profile and i was like oh my god

2493
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
no yeah and i've been learning i've been

2494
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,399
learning so much

2495
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,600
from these younger artists who are

2496
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:41,920
minting coin

2497
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,039
and building things in three-dimensional

2498
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:46,079
space which

2499
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:48,319
the art is almost a representation of

2500
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:50,960
the value that someone's trying to

2501
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:51,920
put on or transfer or pay respect to the

2502
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,880
artist

2503
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:56,239
so the art is almost secondary but i

2504
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,279
like how it applies

2505
01:19:56,238 --> 01:20:02,959
to physical art one

2506
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:05,198
one of one creations that

2507
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,719
and just what i've kind of picked up is

2508
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:09,359
you can mint a token or

2509
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,158
two tokens one for the artist one for

2510
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:14,079
the

2511
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:16,479
buyer and even just the tokens

2512
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:19,840
themselves can increase in value

2513
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:23,359
with no transfer of the uh

2514
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,840
physical tool um so i just think it's so

2515
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:26,960
neat

2516
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,639
and uh you guys are very cool and um you

2517
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:32,079
know there's apps that

2518
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:34,159
trigger the iphone to do infrared uh

2519
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:37,198
three-dimensional scans

2520
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:38,000
uh iradar or there's radars in the name

2521
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:40,079
but on the

2522
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,439
anyway i think these things are becoming

2523
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:42,800
accessible where the artists can

2524
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:46,319
maintain their

2525
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:48,000
um you know kind of earn more

2526
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:49,840
i don't know what it is but it seems

2527
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
cool and i'm done thank you

2528
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,199
sarah it was so cool thanks for the

2529
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,719
support at the cup

2530
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:56,719
and that was very fun

2531
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:04,719
so sarah dave and jason before they left

2532
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,158
like what's next for 420 science like

2533
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,960
what should we uh what should we expect

2534
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:12,158
to see and what do you have on deck

2535
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:14,079
oh my gosh i mean really just

2536
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:15,439
the last thing that dave said to sorry

2537
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:16,800
to be boring but we're just going to

2538
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:21,279
keep building what we have

2539
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:24,320
and double down on what is working and

2540
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:28,719
be thankful for everything that we have

2541
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:30,639
and that we continue to grow

2542
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:33,439
sarah's being very modest for the for

2543
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:35,199
the audience that 420 science has become

2544
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:36,479
by far the biggest head shot that's ever

2545
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:39,359
existed

2546
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:42,000
by my calculations oh and i love that i

2547
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:42,000
mean come on

2548
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,880
it's not a bold it's not a bold

2549
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,080
statement to say that 420 science is now

2550
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,239
literally the biggest headshot that's

2551
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:53,039
ever been in the history of the industry

2552
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:55,678
and have been able to overcome a lot of

2553
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:58,880
challenges that others were not able to

2554
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:02,319
by very very thin hair

2555
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,199
like we i mean look i have amazing

2556

2571
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,440
uh peter you've been in the audience

2572
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:44,000
from future canvas project here for a

2573
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:45,678
little bit

2574
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,359
uh anything that you want to say i know

2575
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,399
that uh yeah you cover all sorts of

2576
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:50,000
different parts of the industry so i

2577
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:53,439
know if you any questions on this

2578
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:56,800
topic before we jumped out yeah

2579
01:22:53,439 --> 01:23:00,479
just quickly kind of the um

2580
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:03,199
you know let's talk china and kind of

2581
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:05,119
disruption and kind like i kind of view

2582
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:08,000
the market as

2583
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:10,079
your kind of generic pieces that used to

2584
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,880
be made in america are obviously moving

2585
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:14,719
to china

2586
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:16,960
so you know that stuff's moving abroad

2587
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:19,439
and kind of the market for american-made

2588
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:22,158
glass is kind of more in the bespoke

2589
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:22,960
kind of artist side of the equation so

2590
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:25,920
can you

2591
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,039
and and from what i understand like

2592
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,440
there were

2593
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:31,439
glass artists who kind of went and

2594
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:35,039
trained people in china on how to do

2595
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:37,439
certain things and techniques um

2596
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:39,600
and so i i guess can you guys just kind

2597
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:43,439
of talk about the

2598
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,199
you know china part of the equation

2599
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:47,119
i think we could talk for several hours

2600
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:50,559
about this dave what do you think

2601
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:50,559
my favorite topic

2602
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:57,599
well um well first of all

2603
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,760
let's talk about the last thing you said

2604
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,719
and dispel the first

2605
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:05,199
myth that we go to china and teach them

2606
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:05,198
anything

2607
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:14,319
there is the there is more

2608
01:24:10,238 --> 01:24:18,319
you know how do i say this um

2609
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:21,279
ingenuity and glassblowing in china

2610
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:22,079
than any glassblower i've ever seen here

2611
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:25,119
primarily

2612
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:28,800
because what china has done

2613
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:31,519
over the past 50 years as

2614
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:33,520
bomax left america i mean this all the

2615
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:36,639
chinese glass market got built

2616
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:40,719
when big borosilicate

2617
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:44,480
um namely bomex which was also

2618
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:46,399
um i'm drawing a blank

2619
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:48,079
there's not i mean corning as well took

2620
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:49,439
a lot of their manufacturing over to

2621
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:52,479
over to asia

2622
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:53,439
and um and built in an immense glass

2623
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:55,039
bowling industry

2624
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:56,879
you know the the the glassblowing

2625
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:59,840
industry in china is

2626
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,239
you know there's there's cities the size

2627
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,000
of

2628
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:07,359
texas that are just glass it's unreal

2629
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,719
and um and so the

2630
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:14,079
there's there's just more access to

2631
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:17,119
material and skilled labor in asia than

2632
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:18,319
there ever will be in the us from a you

2633
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:21,359
know borosilicate

2634
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:24,719
glassblowing standpoint um

2635
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:27,519
so you know the you know

2636
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,158
the the artists that built the pipe

2637
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,480
industry

2638
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:32,719
you know are absolutely the pioneers in

2639
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:36,479
this and that's the big story here but

2640
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:40,480
the you know but the the talent pool

2641
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:42,959
is certainly not here um

2642
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:44,158
and and it's just it's too hard right

2643
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:47,039
like everybody you know

2644
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:48,079
the it's the victim of their own of

2645
01:25:47,039 --> 01:25:49,760
their own making and

2646
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:51,119
in a way that everybody wants to be an

2647
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:54,239
artist everybody wants to be

2648
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:57,039
yuchin everybody wants to be banjo and

2649
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:58,000
you know there is no industry in you

2650
01:25:57,039 --> 01:25:59,119
know in the us

2651
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,039
whether it's you know even if you're

2652
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:02,399
trying to build it in you know southern

2653
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:04,719
california with

2654
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:05,920
you know an immigrant workforce you know

2655
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:07,520
that's impossible

2656
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,440
too you know it's just it's that's

2657
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:13,199
that's failed as well

2658
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:13,919
um so um you know if you want to get to

2659
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:16,719
scale

2660
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,158
as as as we have right like i didn't go

2661
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:21,600
to china to get my products

2662
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:25,119
cheaper i went to china because i

2663
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:28,719
couldn't make it here just absolutely

2664
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:32,559
could not do it it was impossible and so

2665
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:35,679
i went to china and made it there so

2666
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:38,159
um you know we still are you know

2667
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:39,440
have an immense amount of innovation

2668
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:41,920
that happens in the u.s

2669
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:43,678
and you know six thousand square feet of

2670
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:47,600
glassblowing facility that is

2671
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,960
state-of-the-art and um and incredible

2672
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,639
but you know there's just absolutely

2673
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,239
zero chance that we could service this

2674
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:56,480
industry the way that we do

2675
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:57,039
domestically i will also say like we

2676
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:59,678
still

2677
01:26:57,039 --> 01:27:00,639
have very strong sales with our american

2678
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,920
glass

2679
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,800
and there is absolutely an appetite and

2680
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:09,840
a

2681
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:09,840
production to fill it here in the us

2682
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,960
it's the customer preference price but

2683
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:15,919
there's so many factors that go into

2684
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,198
this

2685
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,880
well i was going to ask you about that i

2686
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:20,079
mean sarah from like you know running a

2687
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,600
huge head shop

2688
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:23,279
like how much of what you guys have is

2689
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,639
just production and how much of it is

2690
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:26,238
you know truly artisan

2691
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,440
you know do you guys look at saying okay

2692
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:28,638
fifty percent of what we're gonna sell

2693
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:31,119
is just gonna be your standards

2694
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:32,400
production pieces or is it like 75

2695
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:34,319
when you go into like just trying to

2696
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:35,279
think about um you know what you're

2697
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:37,840
going to move every

2698
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:39,359
month what's kind of the ratio and how

2699
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,800
much of it do you like to keep as far as

2700
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:42,960
like the really high-end artists inside

2701
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,199
of the industry

2702
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,000
um you know up until now we've had a

2703
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:48,479
hard time ever

2704
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,158
selling huddys we've tried over and over

2705
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:53,119
and

2706
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:54,000
our customer base just doesn't support

2707
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:56,559
it

2708
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,238
i mean we will still try again because

2709
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,679
we fucking love it

2710
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:03,599
um as far as like a split you know when

2711
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:05,199
we're look what we're when we're buying

2712
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,960
what we're looking for

2713
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:10,960
is consistency and

2714
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,719
wherever your product is produced as

2715
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,198
long as you can sell me hundreds of

2716
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,480
those

2717
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:18,000
consistently over years that that's what

2718
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:21,119
i'm looking for

2719
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,000
um and there's there are american shops

2720
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:24,719
that can do that

2721
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,439
and they kick ass with us and they're

2722
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:27,198
you know people

2723
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:28,879
are producing overseas that do that and

2724
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:32,000
they kick ass with us

2725
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,760
but we definitely we're always looking

2726
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,560
to add

2727
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,199
american glassblowers or whoever they

2728
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,639
are

2729
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:40,238
it's really at the end of the day is up

2730
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:43,199
to what me and gary like and what we

2731
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:44,718
think will sell and what

2732
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:47,759
you know will continue to be supported

2733
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:47,760
by our customer base

2734
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,840
that makes sense uh danish how you doing

2735
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,600
tonight

2736
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,520
hey rob thanks for the opportunity so i

2737
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,600
run a distribution company called medusa

2738
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:59,280
and we actually distribute a lot of

2739
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,800
grav and i just jumped in on the china

2740
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:04,000
topic because

2741
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:06,560
i think ultimately like brands matter

2742
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,158
more than anything else uh in this space

2743
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,760
just like anything else

2744
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:12,079
just like any other space i guess i

2745
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,880
should say um i think what sarah said is

2746
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:15,279
exactly right

2747
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,920
like one thing that grav has done and we

2748
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:18,960
distribute

2749
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,520
a fair amount of grav um that that seems

2750
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,679
really

2751
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,960
basic but a lot of the americans still

2752
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:25,119
haven't caught up to it is putting

2753
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:26,000
things in a box and putting a barcode on

2754
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:28,158
it

2755
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,039
right like you'd be surprised like you

2756
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:31,519
can't run an

2757
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:33,679
operation at our scale without boxes and

2758
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:36,239
barcodes it's very very difficult

2759
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:38,719
and so like to like we have a lot of

2760
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:41,119
american glass companies that try to um

2761
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:42,639
get distributed through us and the first

2762
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:45,198
thing we always ask is like

2763
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:47,199
what's like where are you on the

2764
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:48,638
timeline of putting things in a box and

2765
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:50,158
putting a barcode on it

2766
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:52,480
and you'd be surprised at how many

2767
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:54,719
conversations stop right there

2768
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:56,158
um and so i think a lot of the american

2769
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:57,520
glass people they don't have scale in

2770
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:59,839
mind and i don't think they want to be

2771
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,440
that big which is okay which is cool

2772
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:03,199
um but you're not going to be like a

2773
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:04,238
grav-sized company unless you think

2774
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:07,359
about things like

2775
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:08,638
barcodes um and so it's it there's a lot

2776
01:30:07,359 --> 01:30:10,079
of that and also like if you think about

2777
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:11,520
companies like empire

2778
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:13,600
that are i think blowing a lot of stuff

2779
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,280
in america still like they just can't do

2780
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:18,480
the volume that the market

2781
01:30:15,279 --> 01:30:20,000
requires um and so i think it's more

2782
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:21,839
than just the price point i think

2783
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
a lot of it is just like super basic

2784
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:27,119
stuff that the american companies just

2785
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,719
haven't gotten around to yet well

2786
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:30,559
danish first of all thank you so much i

2787
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:33,359
didn't i didn't drill into your

2788
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,120
to your profile yet but uh yeah medusa's

2789
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:36,559
well-known around grav and we love you

2790
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:39,198
guys so thanks for the support

2791
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,679
um but it's it you can take it a step

2792
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:41,759
further

2793
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:44,239
on the box thing first you have to be

2794
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:46,560
able to make a simple repeatable product

2795
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:47,359
to sarah's point right you have to make

2796
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,280
it the same

2797
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:50,639
size every time so it fits in the same

2798
01:30:49,279 --> 01:30:52,800
box every time

2799
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:54,319
it stop the conversation stops even

2800
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:57,360
before you get to a box

2801
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:58,399
because it's it's so hard every single

2802
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:00,479
glass pipe

2803
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:02,079
everywhere for everyone's notification

2804
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:04,559
again is hand blown

2805
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:05,760
right whether it's made by someone in

2806
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:09,600
you know in

2807
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,600
in austin texas or in tibet

2808
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:14,399
can you hear me yeah go ahead sorry i

2809
01:31:13,198 --> 01:31:16,399
thought for some reason maybe my phone

2810
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:19,920
wasn't working but please go ahead

2811
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:21,519
um so so yeah i mean it's a really good

2812
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,319
point right like this has been

2813
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:24,800
you know since since the the moment that

2814
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:26,960
that

2815
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,800
i actually started making more than just

2816
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:31,920
the gravitron i was like

2817
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:33,440
oh this there's a big problem in glass

2818
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,880
if you go to this champs trade show that

2819
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:36,399
rob brought up earlier

2820
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,159
that you go to you know booth by booth

2821
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:41,920
by booth and they have

2822
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:43,839
four thousand skus per booth

2823
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,279
there's like here's a bong with a tree

2824
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,880
perk that has eight

2825
01:31:45,279 --> 01:31:48,800
eight arms in it here's a bong with a

2826
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,480
tree perk that has 10 arms in it

2827
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,840
and there's a cost difference and

2828
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:53,519
there's a logo difference

2829
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:55,199
and there's a color difference and so

2830
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,600
now all of a sudden in two skews you

2831
01:31:55,198 --> 01:31:59,439
have

2832
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:01,920
12 missions and it's it makes it makes a

2833
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:03,759
it makes a catalog impossible to build

2834
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,359
um you know so i'm kind of giving away

2835
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,960
the big secret right now like

2836
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:08,639
hey if you want to build a glass company

2837
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,480
make it simple

2838
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:11,760
yeah i mean we say we say to people all

2839
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:12,158
the time right and i'm not trying to

2840
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,560
like

2841
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:16,399
you know take grabs business but i'm

2842
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,920
just like look at grav

2843
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:19,519
right like why aren't you guys doing

2844
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,039
more of what they're doing and sometimes

2845
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,400
we'll like bring in american glass

2846
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:26,319
brands and

2847
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:28,158
we'll have to bring in 100 pieces take

2848
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:30,399
professional pictures of them from every

2849
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:32,960
angle it takes it's like a huge

2850
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:34,479
onboarding thing um and then they'll

2851
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,439
just decide to never make the piece

2852
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:37,198
again

2853
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:38,719
right so we're like okay well how many

2854
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:40,079
times are we going to do this

2855
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:42,000
before we just can't take you guys

2856
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:43,359
seriously because the stores that we

2857
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,399
distribute to the shops and the

2858
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:45,679
dispensaries

2859
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:48,079
that we distribute to it they're like

2860
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:49,440
hey uh are you guys gonna always be out

2861
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:50,319
of stock of that one piece that sold

2862
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:51,759
really well

2863
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:53,439
and then we have to go up the chain and

2864
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,000
and be like hey are you guys ever gonna

2865
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:56,158
make the most

2866
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,119
popular thing you guys ever made again

2867
01:32:56,158 --> 01:32:58,719
and they're like ah

2868
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:00,960
i'm not sure if we're ever gonna do that

2869
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:01,439
one again and it's just maddening right

2870
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,520
so like

2871
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:05,198
to a certain extent like um what dave

2872
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,440
said is exactly right like

2873
01:33:05,198 --> 01:33:08,879
you have to have consistency if you want

2874
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:09,678
stores to carry your stuff because they

2875
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,440
want to

2876
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:15,199
reorder the thing the thing

2877
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:16,479
of the picture that i'm showing to

2878
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:17,839
everyone

2879
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:20,238
i don't want to take more of those

2880
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,239
pictures

2881
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,840
exactly

2882
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,760
well listen guys uh i want to say thank

2883
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,760
you so much

2884
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,280
uh again the club that we're on has

2885
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,800
asked me anything about cannabis

2886
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:34,319
every sunday night we try to cover a

2887
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,199
different topic we try to get in depth

2888
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:37,359
from the people that

2889
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:38,559
really have the best stories to share on

2890
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:40,639
that specific topic

2891
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,159
so next week it might be soil science or

2892
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:45,359
it might be back to the nerdy

2893
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:46,960
legal question again on d8 and um

2894

2895
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,279

2897
