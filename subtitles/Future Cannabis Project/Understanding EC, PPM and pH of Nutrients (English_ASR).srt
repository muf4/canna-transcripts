[Music]

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:18,660
nicer than Yuri different is an EC than

3
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:20,910
200 parts per million of potassium

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,698
because they have a different electro

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,039
conductivity when you're reading parts

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:30,170
per million on a meter it's a

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,390
combination of all the salts together

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:36,960
that you're reading iso as nitrogen

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,628
assault everything that yeah almost all

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,350
fertilizers are salts okay assault is a

11
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:46,070
metal and a nonmetal technically a metal

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:51,870
and a nonmetal that have combined so

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:54,120
nitrogen which calcium nitrate calcium

14
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:57,988
is the metal potassium is the metal

15
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:01,769
nitrate is the nonmetal potassium

16
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:04,588
sulfate is a salt sodium chloride sodium

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,900
is the metal chloride the nonmetal and

18
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:11,219
so most all nutrients are a type of salt

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,350
and it's worried where people will get

20
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:19,500
into difficulty if they use something

21
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:21,959
like urea or ammonia because you can mix

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,569
urea in water and not get a reading

23
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,728
because it's not assault there's no

24
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:29,578
electric electric conductivity in the

25
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:32,158
urea it's simply a double ammonia

26
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:37,739
molecule right and ammonia is the same

27
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,570
way it doesn't read if you if you're

28
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,179
using nose elements you have to be

29
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:44,429
careful that you're understanding how

30
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,610
much you have but the other end of it is

31
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:52,380
is that if you're growing in a situation

32
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:55,170
where it's cold the bacteria that break

33
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:59,718
down urea work at a lower temperature

34
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:02,930
than the bacteria that break down

35
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:06,059
ammonia and so what you can end up with

36
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,829
urea being broke down into ammonia and

37
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,199
just sitting there and then you get

38
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:12,090
ammonia toxicity and if the temperature

39
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,318
is warm enough it just naturally

40
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,030
converts into

41
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,449
nitrogen from the ammonia and if

42
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,739
someone's using their EC reader they

43
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:22,530
won't even know that this is an issue

44
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,480
yes that's right yeah EC or

45
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,908
parts-per-million because they are the

46
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,869
same yeah you're reading the same type

47
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:32,459
of information when you're sort of

48
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,139
mixing together your nutrients and

49
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:41,280
you're measuring ppm which is which is a

50
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,510
derivative of you see what are what are

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,209
you looking for and like what are you

52
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:47,638
different levels tell you yeah if when

53
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,919
you're looking at EC it's basically just

54
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:55,799
telling you a level of nutrients that

55
00:02:49,919 --> 00:03:00,389
are there when it when you're when

56
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:02,609
you're feeding more nutrients there that

57
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:06,269
are present generally the easier the

58
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:08,459
plant has finding them and using them

59
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,769
this is up to a point of course because

60
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,780
everybody knows it's too high you start

61
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,669
burning roots because these salts will

62
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,509
then start pulling water out on the root

63
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:23,159
and the roots die and I say it's it's

64
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:25,258
it's kind of true because what's more

65
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,929
important actually than the level of

66
00:03:25,258 --> 00:03:30,929
nutrients is actually the balance of

67
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,829
nutrients how much nitrogen there is to

68
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,019
potassium

69
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:36,269
compared to phosphorus compared to

70
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,150
calcium compared to iron magnesium

71
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,219
manganese all the different nutrients

72
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,989
that are there the more balanced it is

73
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:45,719
it's like eating a balanced diet

74
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,430
yourself the more balanced it is the

75
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,818
healthier you are the better you feel

76
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:54,709
the more you can do what you're supposed

77
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:59,698
to do if you're overloaded in in fats

78
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:01,500
you might you might grow but carry too

79
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:03,359
much weight and which will not allow you

80
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,889
to do many things that you that you want

81
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:09,329
to do if you don't have enough fats of

82
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,549
course then you don't have enough energy

83
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:14,509
because pretty much you need fat in your

84
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:17,608
diet to get enough energy if you're

85
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:21,959
exercising strenuously or just working

86
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:25,549
hard so it works that way with plants

87
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,500
too the more balanced what you have

88
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,288
nutrient for your plants the better off

89
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,699
you are that's part of why I don't like

90
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:34,490
parts-per-million because everybody

91
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,500
thinks yeah parts-per-million is telling

92
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,120
you what you have for nutrients and it

93
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,639
doesn't it just tells you what the level

94
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,899
of salts are and if it were all sea salt

95
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,579
you would have almost nothing that was

96
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:48,560
good for the plant in there but it would

97
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:51,469
still read parts per million they'll say

98
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,158
1200 right so the readers give you a

99
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,710
rough estimate of the EC of all the

100
00:04:55,158 --> 00:05:00,228
elements in aggregate not like here's

101
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:02,329
the EC of this element or that element

102
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:04,818
yeah and that's a good point

103
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:07,698
EC is no better for reading whether

104
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:10,389
they're good or not it simply is a

105
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:13,699
measurement of a relative level of

106
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:15,860
nutrient or salt in your solution so

107
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:18,468
then it comes to a having a level of

108
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,240
trust that the nutrient supplier is

109
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:22,819
telling you exactly what he's giving

110
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,158
right because if you can trust that then

111
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:27,080
you can sort of at you can work

112
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:30,139
backwards to figure out what's going on

113
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:33,258
right yes you have to remember also that

114
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:36,050
in your nutrient solutions mostly what

115
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:41,840
they talk about is n P and K nitrogen

116
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:45,139
phosphorus potassium but as important of

117
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,429
all is in all of those someone will tell

118
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:50,620
you calcium and that's terribly

119
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:53,090
important but iron copper boron all

120
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,000
seldom are mentioned in there but more

121
00:05:53,089 --> 00:06:03,109
than likely they have those elements in

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:06,168
the feed so then if you do trust what

123
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,538
they say on the packaging then what are

124
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:11,718
you looking for because we talked about

125
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:14,269
having like too hot a solution too weak

126
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:18,348
like what do you sort of want to

127
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:23,740
fine-tune at and why a lot of it depends

128
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:28,129
on how you as a grower are growing

129
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:30,800
temperature how big a root area you have

130
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:34,038
if you've got a twenty five gallon pot

131
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,860
or if you've got a three gallon pot it

132
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,740
all kind of depends then on how much

133
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,639
you're watering

134
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:48,400
if if you're one of water very regular

135
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:50,620
you can get by with a smaller pot like a

136
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,938
three gallon pot you may win good hot

137
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,430
weather you may want it won't be

138
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:54,610
watering you know six eight ten times a

139
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,278
day

140
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,490
smaller doses but more often he gives

141
00:06:57,278 --> 00:07:02,769
you a fresh shot of water also a fresh

142
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,210
shot of nutrients so you keep a relative

143
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:06,848
balance of nutrients throughout the

144
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:08,859
whole day whereas if you are watering

145
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:11,319
say once a day or every other day you

146
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,330
may start in the morning very high and

147
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,778
you just gradually get slower through

148
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:18,609
the day and the plants gonna suck up

149
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:20,408
different nutrients and different

150
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,060
proportions based on what it needs and

151
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:25,389
wants yes and you could actually

152
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,610
potentially from one day to another run

153
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:30,338
short on one of the nutrients and that's

154
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,788
why completely you know reintroducing a

155
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:36,519
complete shot or complete balance is is

156
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:38,680
quite important now I think we missed

157
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:42,758
out I missed I went on a tangent there

158
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,769
from where you see yeah off of BC it's

159
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:49,088
kind of like what do you want to feed at

160
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:51,098
and and if you're watering quite regular

161
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:53,860
you can feed at a higher EC because

162
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:56,168
between the first the one water to the

163
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,830
next you don't lose so much of the

164
00:07:56,168 --> 00:08:01,718
moisture the water I and II see is an

165
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:04,718
electrical conductivity which is a

166
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:09,310
measure of the concentration of salts so

167
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:13,750
in your growing media if you've got just

168
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:17,199
four for a number to pick we've got 500

169
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,810
grams of fertilizer in there and it's

170
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,759
completely saturated the EC is going to

171
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,860
be at a certain level I don't know

172
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,430
exactly what it is but at a certain

173
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:30,278
level as that pot dries out the bat

174
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,288
plant is using water taking water out of

175
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:34,418
there or water is evaporating out the

176
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:36,610
top the EC is just going to climb

177
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:39,908
because it's a concentration of the

178
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:43,509
salts in your media and is as the weight

179
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:46,350
of the media gets lighter because it's

180
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:49,539
losing water the EC is gonna ramp up but

181
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,970
what would bring the EC what would maybe

182
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:54,730
not in the same

183
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:57,430
scope but when the plans suck the plants

184
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,320
sucking up nutrients also lower you see

185
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:01,899
a little bit but not as quickly as the

186
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,290
drawings raising it yeah it tends to use

187
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:08,559
more water and also you do lose some

188
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:11,319
water from evaporation in the from the

189
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,929
media so you tend to the plant tends to

190
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,990
use more water you also never have the

191
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:19,149
the nutrients in exact balance so

192
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,329
there's certain elements that are gonna

193
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:24,339
gradually be climbing depending on the

194
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:27,309
stage of growth or the time of day or

195
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:29,829
what's going on with the way the client

196
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:32,018
is growing so you'll gradually always be

197
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:34,799
building some nutrients maybe

198
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:38,230
diminishing some others but in general

199
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:41,919
as the time from water to water goes the

200
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,079
EC within your your growing media is

201
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:48,549
gonna go up because there is less

202
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:51,250
moisture in there so the other thing

203
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:54,759
this thing reads is pH levels so what

204
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,899
what are we what's the relevance of pH

205
00:09:54,759 --> 00:10:00,789
levels to healthy happy plant growth

206
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,850
specifically cannabis yeah okay cuz

207
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:06,730
different plants have different pH needs

208
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,459
lichens yeah I mean it's a you familiar

209
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,990
with a lot of citrus fruits and

210
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:13,349
camellias in that really like a low pH

211
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:17,769
around four or three five or something

212
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:21,639
most plants like a pH say five five five

213
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:23,589
six to six something six four and then

214
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:28,899
there's some some plants that like it

215
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:31,360
higher than that most of the time it's a

216
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:34,328
result of war the plant origin ated from

217
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,389
originated from because the the plant is

218
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:40,208
developed to survive in a certain

219
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:42,159
environment and so it's genetics gives

220
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:45,009
it a certain pH range that it likes

221
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:49,360
mostly related to how nutrients are

222
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:52,509
available to it pH oftentimes if you've

223
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,818
got a high pH calcium becomes more

224
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:59,439
available if you have a low pH you start

225
00:10:54,818 --> 00:11:02,068
to get low availability of calcium iron

226
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:07,060
and well she herself faded

227
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:10,778
micronutrients all the time say 20 years

228
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:14,559
ago they used to push an EC of our pH of

229
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:16,240
say 65 to 72 or something like that it

230
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,549
is because a lot of the sulfated

231
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,120
micronutrients are more available at

232
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:25,000
those PHS as we've gotten into more

233
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,589
chelated micronutrients the we have

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,360
gradually been working with a bit lower

235
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:32,350
and bit lower so now we start to get

236
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,680
below 6 to mid 5 to mid 6s a pH were

237
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:38,889
many of the pH or the micronutrients are

238
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:46,208
available to the plant so keeping your

239
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:48,579
pH in in a certain level is oftentimes

240
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:51,159
important to the availability of the

241
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:55,359
nutrients around it but so a specific pH

242
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:57,509
level allows nutrients to sort of make

243
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:03,930
themselves bioavailable and different

244
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:07,839
yeah rates yeah you can look in the

245
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:09,599
online encyclopedia or something like

246
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,579
that they'll have a chart that shows

247
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,790
which nutrients are available most at

248
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:17,289
what what PHS and if you take somewhere

249
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:19,568
down the middle where almost everything

250
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:21,490
is available pretty close to the most

251
00:12:19,568 --> 00:12:27,009
there's one or two I'm not actually for

252
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:29,289
kind of outside of that line but there's

253
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,120
a couple of them that if you could run a

254
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:33,009
lower pH now actually be better for that

255
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,679
nutrient but it isn't for any of the

256
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:37,089
others so when I'm working backwards

257
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,399
when a nutrient supplier creates

258
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,519
nutrients they need you to live within a

259
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:45,399
certain pH range because they're

260
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,929
formulating yes to a specific range so

261
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,299
that they know oh we need more of this

262
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:52,179
because that isn't as bioavailable at

263
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:55,028
that range yeah yeah and we as growers

264
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:56,469
just gradually a climate to the climate

265
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:58,208
eyes to that because we notice their

266
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,009
plants are growing better at this pH and

267
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:04,359
so we just kind of gradually push

268
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:05,740
ourselves to the pH of the nutrient that

269
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,039
we're behind because it seems to work

270
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,889
better and so you know here lots of

271
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:14,738
growers talk about this I like a pH of

272
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:16,808
around 6:00 a little above 6 or below 6

273
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:20,109
but really most of the time you're gonna

274
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:23,558
find them in that 5 5 to 65 somewhere in

275
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:25,420
between there and they they found a spot

276
00:13:23,558 --> 00:13:27,428
and it may have to do with their water

277
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:31,719
because the water that you're using is

278
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:33,909
going to affect the pH what kind of what

279
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,428
kind of an acid you're using for pH P I

280
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:40,480
which down up and down because they will

281
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:43,259
react quicker or slower changing the pH

282
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,259
of what you have

283
00:13:47,409 --> 00:14:02,579
