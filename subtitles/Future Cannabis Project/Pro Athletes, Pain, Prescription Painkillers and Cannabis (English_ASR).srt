1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:22,250
I come from a mixed martial arts

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,719
background I played sports my whole life

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:30,329
you know fought in the UFC for several

4
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:34,320
years and you know being around other

5
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:36,899
people who got addicted to opioids that

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,700
scared me you know it at an early age

7
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,460
there was a close family friend of ours

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,620
that we grew up with who his life was

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,859
pretty much shattered by being addicted

10
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:50,089
to opioids and you know that that always

11
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,049
had an effect on me so anytime there was

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,750
something that was going to be

13
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:58,558
prescribed to me for an injury or for

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:03,210
pain I just was always afraid of taking

15
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:05,459
it so I really never did anything at all

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,618
even Advil my member my brother got a

17
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,359
big knot addicted but got a bunch of

18
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:10,650
ulcers from taking advil all the time

19
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,209
because we were doing jiu-jitsu and

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,070
mixed martial arts all the time so he

21
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,408
was taking advil all the time got a

22
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:19,618
bunch of ulcers that scared me

23
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,570
so yeah I just avoided pretty much

24
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,340
taking everything and when you're doing

25
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:25,019
something like mixed martial arts and in

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:30,329
a lot of ways the training is more

27
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:33,000
difficult than the fight itself and in

28
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:35,699
the UFC you can kick you can knee you

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
can elbow you can punch and you're doing

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,820
this with 4 ounce gloves so you know the

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,149
training 40 is brutal you're training 2

32
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:47,758
3 times a day you're sore all the time

33
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,769
you're hurting all the time not to

34
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,299
mention you're taking you know some some

35
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:54,989
blows to the head even before you even

36
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,579
get into the cage so it's very much it's

37
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,769
very difficult on the body and being

38
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:03,929
around the various mixed martial arts

39
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:08,399
gyms kick boxing gyms boxing gyms I saw

40
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,760
a lot of nightmare stories of kids in

41
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,680
and who were addicted to opioids and a

42
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,560
lot of promising careers were thrown

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,459
away because of it so that definitely

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:24,509
had an impact on me and you know it was

45
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,250
a reoccurring theme through all the

46
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:28,340
different gyms that I was around and a

47
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,250
lot of the fighters you know used them

48
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,870
recreationally you know as a party drug

49
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:37,019
vicodin and percocet were mixed with

50
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,629
alcohol and you know a lot of craziness

51
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:41,129
and soot because of it and you know

52
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:44,039
again I just saw a lot of lives

53
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:46,858
shattered because of it and even had a

54
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:50,669
very negative perception of marijuana

55
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:52,290
and cannabis as well coming up you know

56
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,839
I think you know Michelle was talking

57
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:57,120
about how really our perspectives guide

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,539
us and in everything that we do and see

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,200
and I kind of had that that negative

60
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,848
view of cannabis and really didn't try

61
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,628
it until I think I was like twenty eight

62
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:12,298
years old when I was kind of I guess in

63
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:16,858
the beginning earlier part of my UFC

64
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:20,280
career and it definitely helped me in a

65
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:22,169
variety of ways dealing with pain and I

66
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,900
guess seeing things in a different way

67
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:29,459
and and it didn't have those dict of

68
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:32,669
qualities because Simoes get played 12

69
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,969
years in NFL was fun fun career a lot of

70
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:37,859
injuries a lot of war stories I won't

71
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:41,158
bore you with the my new details of it

72
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:43,260
but uh overall I've seen a lot of people

73
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,918
that have been dependent on drugs

74
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:49,709
whether it being advil ibuprofen mixing

75
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,449
caffeine with ibuprofen I know I was at

76
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,669
one time I was doing three advils in a

77
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,340
Red Bull before practice and I was every

78
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,510
day and I'm I mean even the middle of

79
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,348
practice you get another Red Bull and a

80
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,328
little more Advil

81
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:02,939
depending on how your game was the day

82
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,349
by day before you know you dictate

83
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:06,239
whether or not you took vicodins or

84
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:08,789
percocets flex for all they give you

85
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,829
muscle relaxers things like that the

86
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:12,888
worst thing about the NFL is being on a

87
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,599
way trip you're playing in New England

88
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,639
it's cold as hell

89
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,349
you played a rough game and then you got

90
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,288
to get on a flight and you got to fly

91
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,250
away back home and you know I don't know

92
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:24,689
if you guys have seen football players

93
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,269
in person but a lot of those guys are

94
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:29,370
pretty big and I remember my rookie year

95
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:33,750
I'm sitting next to Tony afanasiy he's

96
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,759
about six eight 370 and I'm just being

97
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,019
polite on his eighth on his weight but

98
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,520
I'm hearing me probably close to 400

99
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,698
pounds and I'm sitting next to the guy

100
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,019
and he's got some edible candies and I

101
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,590
asked him was like you know what are

102
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:46,139
these for

103
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:48,119
he's like oh these are a little a little

104
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,560
weed candies I was like well what do you

105
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,728
think you can't take that as bad you

106
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,649
know the other thing that I've know

107
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:54,930
about weed was bad bad bad can't take

108
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:56,189
that it's against the rules he says man

109
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,990
I need something that's gonna help me

110
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:59,399
with this information in my hands he

111
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,228
says because by the time were two wheels

112
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,129
up on this plane my hands gonna swell up

113
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:04,769
to twice the size

114
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:06,509
literally I watched his body just bloat

115
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:08,038
up and I don't know what it was from but

116
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:10,110
and he told me that he was taking a lot

117
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:11,699
of percocets and vicodins and he was

118
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,560
getting a lot of bloating water

119
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,110
retention edema especially in his lower

120
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,930
legs and whatnot so I'm just seeing what

121
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,229
the damage can be done with opiates and

122
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,389
I know that a lot of players were taken

123
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:26,668
like candy you know you mentioned about

124
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,960
the the doctors over prescribing our

125
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:29,129
team physicians would just give you

126
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,138
whatever you eat it I mean especially

127
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,029
not before a game guys I couldn't sleep

128
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,430
or whatnot they would sit there and give

129
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:36,598
out ambience and there's no I mean

130
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,879
there's supposed to be a protocol for

131
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:40,680
prescribing somebody something like what

132
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,728
are the side effects of this announced

133
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,959
or maybe they're I have a

134
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:44,848
contraindication with other medications

135
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,529
people are taking or predisposed

136
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:49,469
positions that might cause a psychotic

137
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:52,408
break which I took em bein one time and

138
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,610
one time only I remember taking it and I

139
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:55,079
woke up in the middle of the night and

140
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,848
my room was in disarray I don't know

141
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,399
what happened but my roommate was

142
00:05:56,848 --> 00:06:00,899
sitting over and the side of the room

143
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,060
looking like what the hell's wrong with

144
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,019
you unless I don't know what happened

145
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,399
man what happened he's like you just

146
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:06,810
woke up yelling screaming and throwing

147
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,698
the bed you through this through the

148
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,658
desk everything like you're insane I

149
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,490
don't know what's wrong with you and

150
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:12,990
come to find out the ambien it cost some

151
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,000
type of issue in my head I don't know

152
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,468
what it was from but probably in the

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,279
years of banging my head into other

154
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:22,168
person but uh yeah I I definitely was

155
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,269
one of the people growing up that I was

156
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:26,728
a straight-a student my whole whole

157
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:27,839
schooling career and always looked at

158
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:29,250
drugs as bad and

159
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,049
you know you hear all the stories about

160
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,250
reefer madness and back in the day your

161
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,689
mom something oh it was that's the

162
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,339
gateway drug and then leads you to all

163
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:36,839
this other stuff and you know you're

164
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,489
near you're gonna be dumb if you smoke

165
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,979
this or you take this it's gonna be bad

166
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,120
so I just kind of avoided my whole life

167
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,400
never really did any research on it

168
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,259
didn't use my scientific minds to sort

169
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,599
of figure out what what the

170
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,519
possibilities were could be from using

171
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,400
cannabis so so you know go through my

172
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,560
whole career you know playing college a

173
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,239
lot of people give NFL flack for what

174
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,189
they give the players but College is ten

175
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,199
times worse because you got to keep your

176
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:03,029
athletes out there making money for the

177
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,009
school and athletes you're not getting

178
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:06,449
compensated so what are they doing when

179
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,709
they can't get access to the drugs

180
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,269
they're going to find whatever is cheap

181
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,229
on the street which you know it's you

182
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:13,769
know what you get when you go on the

183
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:17,310
street so I know when I was in college I

184
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:19,859
was taking celebrex for joint pain

185
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,810
inflammation get to the league they're

186
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,250
taking vicodin

187
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,649
Vikings made me sick but I had to take

188
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,029
because I was in pain so there was no

189
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:28,469
alternative for that because at the time

190
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,459
you can't take any cannabis products

191
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,370
because it's against the rules

192
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:34,560
even CVD was banned a banned substance

193
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,840
as well an NFL their brand substance is

194
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,800
extensive I mean basically if you want

195
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,569
to get big it's got to eat a lot

196
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,740
potatoes and veggies because the certain

197
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:44,189
proteins you can't take because of

198
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,509
contamination anything that has anything

199
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,810
to do with any kind of supplement is

200
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:51,930
very regulated and basically you can eat

201
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,209
amino acids or vitamin C basically this

202
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,910
what we're left with so I'm a lot of

203
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,439
guys NFL are our cannabis users I'm not

204
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,289
gonna name any names I want to keep the

205
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,509
anonymity but a lot of guys use it I

206
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:05,519
mean from 12 years I spend the league I

207
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:07,889
would say probably 70% 70% of the people

208
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,299
in the league use kind of in some form

209
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:13,168
of fashion whether it's edibles or so

210
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,780
ingestible czar smoking it and it's not

211
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:17,719
so I started research about what it does

212
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:21,989
in the body that I learned that the the

213
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:25,440
the v1 was a transient potential cation

214
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,910
channels sub subfamily five is involved

215
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,550
with pain reception or pain perception

216
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,009
so the show I mentioned earlier about

217
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,639
your emotional pain versus physical pain

218
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:36,479
so I know in NFL your job is on the line

219
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,158
every day

220
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,800
so that's stressed in and of itself so

221
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,379
stress causes pain emotional pain am I

222
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,419
gonna have a job

223
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:45,330
I'm gonna feed my kids I'm gonna you

224
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:49,120
know keep the lights on in the house and

225
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:51,009
that stress allows you to build up more

226
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,360
attention and when you have tension you

227
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:53,620
get injured and then you have injury

228
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,100
it's physical pain now you're dealing

229
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,750
with twofold problem and when you have

230
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,550
that stress it keeps your body from

231
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,620
being able to heal so then I noticed

232
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:06,370
that you know smoking cannabis allows

233
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,679
you to relax it gets that move to calm

234
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,210
down a little bit and I remember sitting

235
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,099
with some of the players in the little

236
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,720
smoke session and say no I'm gonna try

237
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,450
this you know just because I want to see

238
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,680
what the hoopla is and I mean there's

239
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,900
different strains that can do different

240
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,579
things in the bodies but the overall

241
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,829
synopsis of the story was I found that

242
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,090
my legs in my knee stopped hurting my

243
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,690
ankle stopped popping when I walk up the

244
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,320
stairs

245
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:31,090
I actually was motivated to study my

246
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,260
playbook you know smoke a little sativa

247
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,480
and then that brain started to get

248
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:35,889
firing okay now of a sudden I'm studying

249
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,120
with weight everything I was told

250
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,259
growing up was this is gonna make you

251
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,220
lazy you're not gonna be able to do

252
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:40,899
anything you're gonna get munchies and

253
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,340
get that and you know you're gonna

254
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:44,169
become a loser in life but I didn't know

255
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,310
that you could smoke sativa and all of a

256
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:47,979
sudden you want to clean your house and

257
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:49,629
organize your your your garage and you

258
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,430
know you want to mow the lawn and buy

259
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:54,460
new curtains and change the blinds and

260
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:56,739
whatnot so there's a lot of applications

261
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,150
that refer for marijuana that you're

262
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,769
just touching the surface of it you know

263
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,659
as far as I can sir research and you

264
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:03,250
know epilepsy seizures medications and

265
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:05,169
things of that nature but just for the

266
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,289
average layperson who just wants to feel

267
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:09,699
good that emotionally I'm sad today well

268
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:10,839
if you take something that's an SSRI

269
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,460
you're going to get depleted with your

270
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,990
serotonin so you're gonna be even more

271
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,220
depressed and then there's no way to

272
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,899
rebound from that now you're pissed off

273
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,879
about that the depression caused you to

274
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,779
drink or it causes you to be angry then

275
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,549
you've got a whole host of other

276
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,929
problems besides the fact that you're

277
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:23,979
back cursing you stubbed your toe on the

278
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,839
couch and now you're yelling at your

279
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,300
kids because they didn't clean up after

280
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,620
they got done playing the Legos yeah I

281
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:31,449
know it's a little PTSD I'll get a

282
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,470
little bit for that probably for that

283
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:37,530
later on but I'm just remember you know

284
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,360
throughout the course of my career

285
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:42,009
trying to find ways to to feel better

286
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,480
but also adhere to the rules because I'm

287
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,409
stickler for hearing to the rules but at

288
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,450
the same time when the rules don't

289
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:48,969
benefit you as a person and it's putting

290
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,290
your your job state on the line you have

291
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,060
to get creative and find ways to sort of

292
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:54,849
better yourself and I know for you guys

293
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:55,219
I would probably smoke 10 joints fry get

294
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,310
into a

295
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,990
fighting those guys just markable how

296
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:02,328
they could do it I had a helmet for my

297
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:06,379
job which I protected my head kind of

298
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:10,219
but uh for you what would be something

299
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:12,289
that one of the benefits of cannabis as

300
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,769
it relates to recovering after a fight

301
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:16,969
like post-fight recovery you know in in

302
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:19,310
mixed martial arts

303
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,370
obviously you're sore a lot but also you

304
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:25,099
know it's important to see what you're

305
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:27,649
doing in a different way and I think it

306
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,509
certainly opened up my mind I I almost

307
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:33,139
wish I did more of it while I was

308
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:35,449
fighting because I see it so differently

309
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:38,688
now you're always looking for the latest

310
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:40,849
and greatest techniques the best ways

311
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:43,188
most efficient ways to train and I

312
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,879
really felt that cannabis opened up my

313
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:51,980
mind to see things very differently so

314
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:55,129
as far as just how to be creative I some

315
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,589
guys take it in very a black-and-white

316
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:59,569
approach as far as how they train for a

317
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:02,420
fight you go in you hit pads you're spar

318
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:07,399
and that's pretty much it I liked seeing

319
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:10,068
it as more of a creative process so for

320
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,610
me for that reason cannabis was very

321
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:16,068
valuable but certainly as far as

322
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:19,430
recovering from fights and recovering

323
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:23,299
from heavy training sessions and you

324
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:26,058
know whatever injuries I had it was very

325
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:28,729
important for me and I also didn't sleep

326
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:31,250
well as you can imagine getting ready

327
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:34,339
for a fight of another dude who is

328
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,839
training across the world and getting

329
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,680
ready to beat you up that could be a

330
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:43,639
pretty stressful situation so sometimes

331
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:45,979
you know sleeping was difficult for me

332
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:49,909
because you're also I'm an analyzer and

333
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,709
to a fault and I'd be thinking about you

334
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,909
know how I should be approaching this

335
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:55,549
fight or what I should be doing or

336
00:12:52,909 --> 00:13:00,019
watching video and all that stuff so it

337
00:12:55,549 --> 00:13:02,870
did help me relax a lot and where it

338
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:06,740
gets tricky especially now in the UFC is

339
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,509
that they do have drug testing I wish

340
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,879
they had more drug testing when I was

341
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:13,970
fighting because a lot of guys in my

342
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:17,720
opinion are using a lot of peds back in

343
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:20,960
the day so you know with with the fight

344
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:25,190
game now you sada is involved in testing

345
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:28,000
protocols and while you are and it's a

346
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:32,300
great thing is that when you're not in

347
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,009
when you're not preparing for a fight

348
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:37,099
let's say I think it's like seven days I

349
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:40,250
think is this standard within seven days

350
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,409
you can't use marijuana but if you're in

351
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,149
a non training camp or you're not

352
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:45,679
getting ready for a fight you can use

353
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:48,439
marijuana so the fact that they're just

354
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:51,199
seeing it now like that is a big change

355
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,400
than when I was fighting so I think they

356
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,580
are seeing more benefits to it they're

357
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,709
opening up their mind more to it back in

358
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:04,340
the day if you know when I was fighting

359
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:06,230
if you were caught using cannabis you

360
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,200
would be suspended for three months six

361
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,759
months sometimes a year or more and in

362
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,530
mixed martial arts you know when I was

363
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,539
fighting you weren't making a whole lot

364
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:16,009
of money these aren't guys that are

365
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:18,409
making millions and millions of dollars

366
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:22,399
now you have the potential to kind of

367
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:25,189
make that but back in the day it really

368
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:29,600
wasn't like that unless you were an

369
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:31,520
elite fighter so that would that was

370
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,870
tough I know on a lot of fighters you

371
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,669
know getting you know testing positive

372
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,379
for something you know you're out for a

373
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:39,649
year you're not gonna be able to pay the

374
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:41,480
bills so things are changing in a

375
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:45,079
positive direction and and it's good to

376
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,970
see that and you know there's even a lot

377
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,820
of fighters that are you know now being

378
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,710
sponsored by CB

379
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:55,190
companies and and different cannabis

380
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:57,650
companies and you know it's a very

381
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,810
different landscape than it was even you

382
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:02,059
know three five years ago yeah I think

383
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:05,029
that if they were able to sponsor NFL

384
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:07,459
athletes or NBA athletes with cannabis

385
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,629
products I mean well not only one would

386
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,340
they make a lot of money but to I think

387
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:13,279
they would get the word out because a

388
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,930
lot of people have that stigma still you

389
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,299
can't use marijuana or this that

390
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:18,739
whatever is bad cannabis is bad hemp is

391
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:21,079
bad and all of a sudden now hemp is

392
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,549
legal with the farm bill and now they're

393
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,278
working on scheduling for

394
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:27,500
cannabis as well but I know for a fact

395
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,240
that once people start using the proper

396
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,208
vernacular and how to speak about it

397
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,700
properly I think that'll be monumental

398
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,379
as far as pushing it for for scheduling

399
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,970
to become more prevalent where what's

400
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:40,970
now it's schedule - as opposed to

401
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,680
schedule one and I know that um people

402
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,120
are apprehensive I know Roger Goodell is

403
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,099
apprehensive about it because they have

404
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,600
such heavy policies on people who've

405
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,250
been smoking weed I mean josh gordon got

406
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,050
spend ten times or something like that

407
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,240
Ricky Williams took a year off to go on

408
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:54,528
sabbatical to smoke and he knew

409
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,028
something we didn't know was like okay

410
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:58,789
my body's getting beat down I need you

411
00:15:56,028 --> 00:16:00,139
gonna fix it and repair it and I didn't

412
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:01,669
realize the benefits of its allies

413
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,528
myself startup are taking it and I

414
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,509
realized that you know staying calm

415
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:07,070
being able to sleep being able to eat

416
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,569
you know sometimes when you're nervous

417
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,160
or you're frustrated or you're injured

418
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,990
you're depressed something you don't

419
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,389
have the same eating habits and you eat

420
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,070
bad or you're impulsively eating but now

421
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:18,230
like when you you get the munchies I

422
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,640
know if you've had money before but you

423
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,720
eat I'm not sure I have healthy food in

424
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:22,819
my house but you know I'm eating

425
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,019
properly and eating eating more than

426
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,480
what I would if I was stressed out I

427
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:29,570
wouldn't be eating I remember I had a

428
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,310
coach and he was in his 40s and he would

429
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,320
be sparring and training with us for

430
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:35,869
hours and I was like how do you do that

431
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,629
how you doing that in your 40s and he's

432
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:41,028
like smoke weed you know that I smoked

433
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:43,700
weed up he's like I'm able to keep up

434
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:47,689
with you guys I'm relaxed I'm not using

435
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,070
as much energy and I tell you what he

436
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,700
was one of the best guys in the gym

437
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:55,430
training and sparring even in his 40s

438
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,009
and he moved amazingly well and he could

439
00:16:55,429 --> 00:17:00,019
train for a long period of time and

440
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:02,720
there's a few su fighters and I will

441
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:06,039
definitely not say their names some of

442
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,078
them are very vocal about their use but

443
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:10,609
some of the guys that do triathlons and

444
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:12,918
they were explaining to me they're

445
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,328
saying you know when I get tired you

446
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,009
know I'll be in the middle and I'll

447
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:18,799
start my run he's like I take my pen out

448
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:21,049
and I just hit the pen and I'm gone I

449
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,299
just get focused and it was just blow it

450
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:25,849
was blowing my mind because I never used

451
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:28,730
and trained I I did after I stopped

452
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:30,230
fighting and I got huge benefits to it I

453
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:34,299
got it I understood what they were

454
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:36,400
saying but yeah I almost you know

455
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:39,579
way I almost feel like it's cheating in

456
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,290
some ways because I'm so not in my head

457
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:44,259
I'm just in the moment and I'm training

458
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:45,490
and I'm creative and it's almost not

459
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:48,940
fair when I'm training with someone

460
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,500
because I don't know that's the other

461
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,180
reason why I wish I was using a little

462
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,170
bit more when I was fighting because I

463
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:59,560
never used and trained so in that regard

464
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:02,800
I definitely found benefits after I was

465
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:05,859
done fighting when I retired but a lot

466
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:09,490
of guys you know use and are very active

467
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:11,559
and are performing even better so it it

468
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:14,410
is a performance enhancer in a lot of

469
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:16,659
ways so I've seen a couple guys that

470
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,040
would smoke regularly and it was like

471
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,540
something they did every day I wake up

472
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:23,109
smoke get off the practice they smoked

473
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:25,269
and told me that it actually dulled the

474
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:26,439
pain increase their pain threshold so

475
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,910
like you said I think it is kind of

476
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,350
cheating because all the guys that were

477
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,730
never injured they were always at

478
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:32,259
practice they're always focus having a

479
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,490
good time what are the guys that smoke

480
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:35,890
weed you know I don't know if it's

481
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,089
because they're they're just relaxed and

482
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,320
living life they're just out there

483
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,669
getting it but actually you know you

484
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,409
start to realize that they're

485
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:44,050
inflammations worse they're less pain

486
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:46,630
and they're functioning properly yeah so

487
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:48,009
it's it's amazing to see that the people

488
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,020
that are using were the ones that were

489
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:51,339
actually doing good and the ones that

490
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:53,619
weren't we're the ones that were feeling

491
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,819
the pain and whatnot so that's kind of

492
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:56,919
productive what they teach you growing

493
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:58,419
up is that oh it's bad you smoke it's

494
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,560
gonna ruin your lungs you're gonna get

495
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,120
cancer which I don't know anybody that

496
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,569
passed away from cancer from smoking

497
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,859
weed or overdose either you could to

498
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:07,569
have too much of an edible and you feel

499
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:09,339
actually gonna die of it this is true

500
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:13,259
you don't actually die I actually I

501
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:15,099
wanted to ask Michelle a question um I

502
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:19,809
don't know if you've heard anything

503
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:22,119
about the effects of it helping brain

504
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:23,559
trauma or anything like that I know

505
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,329
there were some studies out on it and

506
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,659
then I'd be curious it's probably

507
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:30,309
relevant to what me and kasym do but I'd

508
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,460
love to hear about that so there is

509
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:35,169
actual research on having tea tea in

510
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,090
your system when you have a brain injury

511
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:40,000
so if you're in a car accident for

512
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:42,250
example you have THC onboard your brain

513
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,079
will actually recover faster than if you

514
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,279
didn't have THC so

515
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,720
you know that's one thing that we can

516
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:49,339
say if you're gonna have you know

517
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,870
repeated blows to the head you want to

518
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:53,299
each see in your system and I mean I

519
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:56,059
studied neurogenesis I studied how these

520
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:57,559
newborn brain cells can help recover you

521
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,119
know your brain from brain injury so

522
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:01,399
there's definitely something to it where

523
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,079
you don't know about CBD I would assume

524
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,910
the same thing if you have CBD in your

525
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:06,289
system and you get in the head I think

526
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,660
that your brain is going to recover

527
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:10,250
faster but you know that's why there's a

528
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,930
lot of research that's happening and I

529
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,519
know you guys are involved with athletes

530
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,500
for care but they're studying these

531
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,960
things you know what happens to your

532
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,029
brain you know if you have a traumatic

533
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,950
brain injury and you use CBD is your

534
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:23,210
brain functioning better there's ways

535
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,980
that we can actually study this with

536
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,590
brain scans so this is an exciting time

537
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,900
and I hope that you know we'll find out

538
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:30,049
all the answers soon so thanks wow thank

539
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,060
you

540
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:34,399
yeah I actually uh I went to the brain

541
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:36,950
treatment center down in San Diego my

542
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
wife noticed a decline in my mental

543
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,330
capacity I always considered myself

544
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,240
pretty high intellect a nerd so to speak

545
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:45,349
and I would be talking with her and she

546
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,269
said I would be mumbling I have

547
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:49,189
gibberish or my I would slurring my

548
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:50,930
speech or I would like tail off from my

549
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,509
thoughts and I didn't notice it myself

550
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,110
but then she recorded me and showed me

551
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:55,670
sometimes like yeah that's kind of

552
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:57,469
interesting I've never heard myself

553
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,140
speak like that and I'm I would be

554
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,640
talking so fast and when I was speaking

555
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,930
faster than when the words could come

556
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,520
out so I'll be on the next word didn't

557
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,930
finish the first word so I didn't notice

558
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:08,450
that at first but then I went to the

559
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,190
brain treatment center they did give me

560
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,259
a picture of my brain showing the

561
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,110
activity of my aweful waves so then the

562
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:16,279
doctor who was in charge of the whole

563
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,240
brain treatment center he's actually a

564
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,619
former Navy SEAL

565
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,819
so he's been through traumatic brain

566
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:21,799
injury and stuff like that from the

567
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:23,450
percussions of explosions of whatnot so

568
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,099
he told me while you're doing the

569
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,289
treatment in between the days that you

570
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,639
have to do your treatments smoke smoke a

571
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:30,289
lot of wheat or or take CBD

572
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,090
full-spectrum TV just take a ton of it

573
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,619
and then come in and make sure you load

574
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:36,199
up on before you come in our for your

575
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:38,119
session so they drink brain treatment

576
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,950
center does they put a Tesla magnet in

577
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:42,559
order to test the magnet on your frontal

578
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,819
lobe because all the damage that we do

579
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,169
in your brain from concussions or

580
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:47,539
whatnot and I fell most of them come

581
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,430
from front frontal collisions of your

582
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,170
frontal lobe so the front of the brain

583
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,360
starts to slow down it's a frequency

584
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,160
it's the back of the brain is a little

585
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,500
faster so that signal that goes to the

586
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,759
front of your brain the charger of

587
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:03,589
emotional control motional stability

588
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:05,089
sleep alertness of tenderness and all

589
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,529
those would decline from all the the

590
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:08,269
brain injuries and whatnot so frequency

591
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:10,759
to be slow so I think it was at eleven

592
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:13,940
megahertz in the back and seven in the

593
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:16,460
front so it was a huge issue with that

594
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,259
and then it says what the the beta waves

595
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,079
in the theta ways that were my brain he

596
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:22,160
says literally you have a ton of alpha

597
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,210
waves that are flying everywhere but

598
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,620
they're not in sync with the front of

599
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,660
your brain and then you have a lot of

600
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:28,939
the theta waves so basically it's almost

601
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,380
like you're sleeping but you're awake so

602
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,390
like you're you're in a zone but you're

603
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,040
not there and he's like you when you

604
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,560
smoke this this the weed and the CBD

605
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:39,230
it's gonna allow your brain to focus all

606
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,509
those alpha waves to get to the same

607
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,069
frequency so it actually benefited a lot

608
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:44,779
more I didn't know at first and there's

609
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:45,500
no research he's like there's just

610
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:46,609
something we just stumbled across

611
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,630
because they have a lot of guys of smoke

612
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:49,129
weed so they told me that they feel

613
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,010
better when they're there smoking weed

614
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,130
and they're taking the the treatments so

615
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:56,329
it's it's huge that like I think you

616
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:59,690
mentioned more about like the research

617
00:22:56,329 --> 00:23:02,329
is going on right now a lot of holding

618
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,210
up of research on patients but I mean

619
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:07,579
we've been smoking weed since what 400

620
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,450
AD and people smoking weed so I mean

621
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:10,429
there's a lot of guinea pigs that are

622
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,470
out there just have to speak more about

623
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,509
it and and put the information out there

624
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,930
for people to know like you know people

625
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:19,700
don't know that this works with this

626
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,320
this medication combined with cannabis

627
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,930
can actually improve the medications

628
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:25,339
potency and the efficacy so just people

629
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,630
being able to say that out loud and

630
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:28,549
having forums like this in order to

631
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:31,070
speak and engage in conversation they'll

632
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:32,240
be able to explain their personal

633
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:34,129
experiences with that so that I mean

634
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,990
that can go to people who are doing

635
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,120
research can actually have you know that

636
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,269
first-hand experience of what's going on

637
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,829
with your body like I gave my mom pure

638
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:45,049
pure CBD extract she has a full full

639
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:46,189
spectrum extract and it helped regulate

640
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,539
her blood sugar and I didn't know that

641
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,360
it could help with diabetes but

642
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:53,059
apparently it does so that was my little

643
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:55,609
trial and error for that that part it's

644
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:58,940
amazing just how many different benefits

645
00:23:55,609 --> 00:24:03,409
there are to cannabis and and CBD and

646
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:07,740
THC I had a really bad rib injury right

647
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:12,210
around Christmastime 2018 and

648
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:14,880
I just got over it probably you know but

649
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,319
a month or so ago and one of the things

650
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,740
that allowed me to keep training

651
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:21,869
throughout because I don't know I I keep

652
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:26,839
training through pains sometimes is uh

653
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:29,819
it was the CBD CBD creams and oils and

654
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,899
it was just a game changer for me and

655
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:33,689
without me

656
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:37,860
I don't know having to use something

657
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:43,440
like opioids and you know it it's it's

658
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:45,990
crazy because we don't have UFC like

659
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,220
teams of doctors that prescribe stuff to

660
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,440
us you know we have our own personal

661
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:53,009
doctors it's not organized I guess like

662
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,450
like the NFL teams for example but even

663
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:57,660
you know my father was a physician it

664
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:59,430
just they're very quick to what do you

665
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,660
need for paint okay here you go here's

666
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:06,210
the vicodin here's there's percocets and

667
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:08,660
it's it'd be nice to get people to kind

668
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,730
of change their perceptions and I think

669
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,560
you know you know Michelle was talking

670
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,480
about what education sometimes it

671
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:19,169
doesn't work on people you know I agree

672
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,259
with that but I also think that it helps

673
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,700
as well you know educating people on

674
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:26,250
really what are the benefits you know

675
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,890
what is going to happen if you use

676
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:31,109
cannabis is your life going to be over

677
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,640
are you going to be really lazy or you

678
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:37,099
know a lot of people just have these

679
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,100
crazy perceptions and crazy ideas and

680
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:42,750
you know everything pretty much and I

681
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:44,519
think education is key doesn't work on

682
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,440
everybody people are gonna believe what

683
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:49,139
they're gonna believe but I I do think

684
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,360
there's a lot of benefits to it and you

685
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:54,090
know it just it's forms like this that I

686
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:57,179
think will will hopefully help and

687
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:59,849
educate people I think is monumental for

688
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:02,070
UFC fighters MMA in general because you

689
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,449
guys have a fight here and then the next

690
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:05,309
fights not for what six or seven months

691
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,890
sometime people take more fights in the

692
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:10,649
year but I mean in doing that I think

693
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,630
masking pain while training is good if

694
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,040
you get injury and it prevents you from

695
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,200
training for about five days that five

696
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,139
days is huge because their fights coming

697
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,630
up and when NFL we have like 16 games

698
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,009
and you know

699
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,570
you can come out and somebody I'll go in

700
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:23,980
for you there's backups there's no

701
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:27,069
backups and fighting so you got to do it

702
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:29,440
all yourself and that I mean that right

703
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:31,359
there in and of itself just it shows the

704
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,150
power I can you said a lot of people are

705
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,519
getting sponsored by CBS now because it

706
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:38,200
actually works and I see athletes are

707
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:39,639
benefitting from it I know some of the

708
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,500
fighters that are sponsored that are

709
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,080
taking CV deters say that it's

710
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,730
monumental for just joint pain I mean I

711
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,379
imagine getting into the ring and you

712
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,259
running a role on the ring and jujitsu

713
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:52,960
and your knees are aching I couldn't do

714
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:55,480
it no and it's a great point you know

715
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,700
not to say it's easier necessarily but

716
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,339
you know in the NFL if you're not able

717
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,870
to play on a Sunday you know you wait

718
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:03,579
and you're able to to play the next

719
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:05,589
Sunday and you're good your contract

720
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:07,809
kind of guarantees you a certain amount

721
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:09,609
of money not the case in fighting if

722
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,529
you're not able to go that Saturday

723
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:13,209
night well good luck maybe you got to

724
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:15,309
fight another three months or maybe you

725
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,319
don't and a lot of times you don't and

726
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:20,230
that's the only way you're really going

727
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:21,909
to get paid sponsorship has changed

728
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,130
significantly in the UFC there was a

729
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,170
time where you know it kind of looked

730
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:28,330
like you had NASCAR shorts you had

731
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,820
sponsors all over now you can't really

732
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:34,210
do that there's other ways to go about

733
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:36,460
those sponsorships but you know that

734
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,769
that's that's it that's all you got so

735
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,299
if you're not able to fight you're not

736
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:42,490
getting paid you're not able to pay the

737
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:46,029
bills and a lot of guys are dealing with

738
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:48,220
a lot of pain and have to fight with

739
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:50,019
with major injuries if you have to go up

740
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:56,259
in a weight class I think that kind of

741
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:58,299
is could help probably yeah I think the

742
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:00,579
huge thing is uh you guys I mentioned

743
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:01,869
about education I think speaking from a

744
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:03,279
scientific background speaking from a

745
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:07,000
medical background would actually help

746
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,829
the community as a whole so I think ways

747
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,269
that we can benefit each other is

748
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:12,309
speaking about opening with people who

749
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:14,619
are against it and using the vernacular

750
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:15,819
that we use in the industry so sort of

751
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:16,809
become layman terms so they can

752
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,549
understand what we're talking about

753
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:20,649
because if you go to someone and say oh

754
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:22,599
you're Lakers just smoke a little weed

755
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,610
you'd be good no I don't smoke me that's

756
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:25,990
bad whereas you tell them if you hit

757
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:28,119
those cation channels that help your

758
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,680
body reduce the pain so it slows down

759
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,909
that synaptic firing from that muscle

760
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,830
area where you're getting hurt the pain

761
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,548
slows down the fire until your brain

762
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:35,259
then you know

763
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:36,700
you'll feel a little better okay that

764
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:37,210
sounds good it's like a light on all

765
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,870
right

766
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,149
yeah like Tylenol but it smells funny

767
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:44,528
[Laughter]

768
00:28:42,148 --> 00:28:45,819
yeah my mom was Adam Lee against their

769
00:28:44,528 --> 00:28:47,919
rustic you know you're taking all these

770
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:50,109
medications you got high blood pressure

771
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,480
medication you got diabetic medication

772
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:54,729
and you got pain medication for

773
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,220
arthritis and whatnot and like you know

774
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,569
if you just take a little this stuff

775
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,129
right here you'll feel a lot better

776
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:02,349
oh no I don't do that stuff it makes you

777
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:03,548
feel weird no actually this is CBD so

778
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:05,259
it's non psychoactive you're not gonna

779
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:06,759
get high just take it you'll feel good

780
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:09,038
well we're not gonna get higher then

781
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:12,308
it's not we yeah mom it's not we just

782
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,569
take it and Mike Mike knows my mom she

783
00:29:12,308 --> 00:29:14,980
was the one that was stickler for

784
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:16,749
anybody to him smoke weed incoming house

785
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,190
you get out of here you're a pothead and

786
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:21,100
this and that whatever you guys are did

787
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:23,470
whatever so I got I had to educate her

788
00:29:21,099 --> 00:29:24,730
on what Stevie Dee was and you know

789
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,350
through the course of educating her on

790
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,358
that and she became advocate for and she

791
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,498
started to tell her friends and the word

792
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:31,480
just spreads like wildfire to where I

793
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:32,589
have one her sixty five-year-old friends

794
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,220
calling to say hey can I get some of

795
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:38,019
that weed you gave your mom it means

796
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,429
funny but I mean I it's a blessing

797
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:41,079
because they began to share that

798
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:42,309
knowledge and information just it

799
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,079
benefits somebody else's life who

800
00:29:42,308 --> 00:29:46,118
otherwise would be going through pain or

801
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,678
taking some type of opiate that would

802
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:49,569
you know it's not beneficial to their

803
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,249
body I know one thing when people take a

804
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:51,878
lot of vicodin they can't they can't go

805
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:54,759
to the restroom

806
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:55,898
and you're not hungry so I mean that's

807
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:57,999
kind of crucial to when you're a

808
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:59,258
finely-tuned athlete you got to get

809
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:00,489
nutrition it's important or sure to get

810
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:03,089
muscle breakdown so when you take a

811
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:06,730
vicodin you can't pass the stuff out

812
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:08,349
you're uncomfortable yeah yeah it's

813
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,569
amazing how things have changed I mean I

814
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:12,459
own a couple of mixed martial arts and

815
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:16,148
jiu-jitsu gyms at one in Boston one here

816
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:20,558
in LA and you know we sell CBD products

817
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:22,418
for them to use on their body and we

818
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:26,460
believe in it it's helpful it's been

819
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:28,840
helpful to me and it's just amazing how

820
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,329
things have changed in California things

821
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:33,220
are changing in Massachusetts as well

822
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:35,220
obviously and in regards to the

823
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,970
perceptions and the rule and the laws

824
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,039
regarding cannabis so

825
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,900
it's been speaking about Boston will be

826
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:43,970
the last place on earth they're pretty I

827
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:49,009
know it's funny I was surprised by this

828
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:51,950
well what is your favorite form of a way

829
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:55,879
to use the medicine what's most

830
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:59,410
effective for you for me I think as far

831
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:06,380
as like creams or creams Fincher's

832
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:10,370
capsules or flowers right I get

833
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:14,180
suppositories those are my faves yeah I

834
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:16,879
you know I I I do enjoy yeah i I do

835
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:22,340
enjoy smoking it I really do

836
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:24,350
I do edibles as well and I find a lot of

837
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:27,529
benefits to just the oils and the creams

838
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:29,389
for for pain joint pain and stuff like

839
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:34,190
that it's been huge I actually retired

840
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:35,660
in 2011 because of back pain and one of

841
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,200
the things that really helped me was was

842
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:41,090
smoking cannabis there was so much pain

843
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,890
that it hurt if I sat down or her if I

844
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:48,470
stood up and heard if I moved it didn't

845
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:52,280
matter and it was extremely helpful and

846
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:54,799
allowed me to function on a daily basis

847
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:56,920
and a little by little able to kind of

848
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,329
work my way back and into training but

849
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,029
yeah and I'm the kind of person that if

850
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:04,849
I'm not doing martial arts I'm miserable

851
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:06,589
I get depressed so I need that as an

852
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:10,669
outlet for for me physically and

853
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:12,230
creatively and cannabis is a lot me to

854
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,840
do that the most fun I have is when I

855
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,059
start to learn about different strains

856
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,919
sativa indica hybrids the percentage of

857
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:22,369
each one whether using the tincture or

858
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,960
the full spectrum isolate I think this

859
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:26,659
is a lot of fun to learn all that stuff

860
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,940
and then am I just going around saying

861
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,170
hey use this cannabis because it's good

862
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,730
for you you're actually able to break it

863
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,410
down scientifically and say well use

864
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:34,880
this right here because a sativa is

865
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,590
gonna give you the the head high so you

866
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,300
can stimulate your your mental

867
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:40,250
production or your body's hurt you got a

868
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:41,720
long day at work and your yourse or

869
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,130
you're on your feet all day some of the

870
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,829
indica to help you relax and get you

871
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,360
ready for bed so I think this um much

872
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:49,069
like I did with sports and learning the

873
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:50,779
PlayBook sat there and learn everything

874
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:51,379
on here still know about cannabis and

875
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,690
and

876
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:57,020
him and sort of figure out a game plan

877
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:59,210
for myself and I was talking earlier

878
00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:01,819
about the athletes not being able to be

879
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,890
paid for the training and I think that

880
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:05,089
um athletes are the big sounding board

881
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,620
for the general public especially

882
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:08,480
fighters because everybody loves the

883
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:10,069
fighters fighters just well fighter

884
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,150
walks in the room you initially want to

885
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:11,839
be his best friend because you know I

886
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:15,050
can kick your ass

887
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,459
it's just that's how it works so I mean

888
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:18,740
I think that fighters have the ability

889
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,750
to you know not only be that Stokes

890
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,069
pushes forward but they're educated

891
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,069
there's much like they know their sport

892
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:27,529
they can know cannabis and sort of talk

893
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:29,269
to the layperson about using it and how

894
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:32,509
to use it and why it's important I'm

895
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:35,839
curious to find out what they do in the

896
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:38,210
NFL if you are caught smoking you hit a

897
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,889
little bit on and with Gordon but what

898
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,720
do they do what are the protocols and

899
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:44,060
what are the protocols in place to

900
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,319
protect the player and house that'll go

901
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:46,730
down or you get fined

902
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:48,439
first offense you get fined you then

903
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,970
they put you in the substance abuse

904
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,490
program so you have to pee in a cup

905
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,529
every week probably three times a week

906
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:56,420
it's um I've seen people go through it

907
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:58,609
they hate it's the worst but um yeah you

908
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:01,490
get fine and then second offense you get

909
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:03,859
a four-game suspension and then you get

910
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,059
put into the program and you have to you

911
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:07,909
know meet with the psychologist and

912
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:10,340
whatnot and then um third offense I

913
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:13,250
think it's a eight-game suspension and a

914
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,769
fine and you could possibly get conduct

915
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,960
detrimental so it escalates each time

916
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:19,668
you do it but I mean Josh Gordon was

917
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,800
continually getting in trouble for

918
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:23,599
smoking weed and I mean he was just

919
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,039
always ready to play every game he was

920
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,719
there and ready to play and I think that

921
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,300
cannabis was a huge part of his ability

922
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:32,029
to be relaxed and comfortable and he

923
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,760
just he moved effortlessly and I swear

924
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,280
to god it's because of cannabis but uh

925
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,139
yeah I mean he just they don't really

926
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,820
want to get rid of you because you smoke

927
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,050
weed but they have their rules that they

928
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,269
have in place that they have to adhere

929
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:46,280
to which is kind of to me it shows that

930
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:47,659
that they want to allow it but they

931
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,300
can't allow it because the backpressure

932
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:53,000
they get from the Jenner plug I think

933
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,320
but they'll prescribe opioids quickly

934
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,480
yeah in a heartbeat here take this

935
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,219
toward all get in there how can that be

936
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,009
change or how do you see that changing

937
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:04,170
I think it's just gotta have a the the

938
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:05,759
NFL Players Union has to rally together

939
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,709
behind the people who have the lawsuits

940
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:10,259
against NFL for the damage has been done

941
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:12,719
so there's walking evidence of people in

942
00:35:10,259 --> 00:35:14,190
in the community now that are former

943
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,479
players their walk around with pain that

944
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,429
have problems with their body because of

945
00:35:15,478 --> 00:35:18,689
all the opiates they've taken and all

946
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:20,489
the stuff they put in their body I mean

947
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,729
I was a time where I was playing a game

948
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:26,190
and it was a really good year we were 14

949
00:35:23,728 --> 00:35:29,038
and 2 but we were just playing at a high

950
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,630
level and I was putting DMSO and

951
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,759
ketoprofen on my body and DMS though

952
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,390
it's not clear by the FDA it's not good

953
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:34,858
for your body

954
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:36,900
I don't know what the side effects are

955
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:38,219
probably in another 20 years I already

956
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,858
have another leg growing out on my body

957
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:42,929
I don't know but um whatever it took to

958
00:35:40,858 --> 00:35:44,458
be on the field that's what everybody's

959
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:45,808
mentalities I can't lose my job I'll do

960
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,858
whatever so if you got this I'll take it

961
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:48,680
give it to me I want to feel better I

962
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:50,548
want to I want to be able to work and

963
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:52,469
players are not gonna stand up for

964
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:54,208
themselves they're so focused on trying

965
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:56,099
to survive that they're not focused on

966
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:57,868
what the bodies what damage is being

967
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:00,239
done and the long-term effects of it so

968
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:02,009
I think the the alumni has to jump back

969
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,719
in and say you know what look at my body

970
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:05,248
I'm 55 years old and people are dying

971
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:06,420
from heart attacks and do they don't

972
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,788
know why but it's because of all the

973
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,459
something put in their body people are

974
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:14,028
going to having dementia at 60

975
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:17,788
Alzheimer's it's a high prevalence of

976
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:19,829
people who have brain issues and they're

977
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:21,509
just now sort of rolling out packages to

978
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:23,339
help with that disability plan but

979
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:25,619
there's a lot of lawsuits still against

980
00:36:23,338 --> 00:36:26,998
the NFL because of that and I think that

981
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,709
they would just look at the books and

982
00:36:26,998 --> 00:36:30,629
say if we start allowing people to take

983
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:33,208
CVD start allowing people to use

984
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:35,009
cannabis there's a lot of money that

985
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:36,358
saves us in the long run so I mean from

986
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:37,650
a business perspective I would just look

987
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:39,119
at the brass tacks of the numbers and

988
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,858
just say you know what it's probably

989
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,390
more profitable for us to do this and

990
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:44,098
they say oh well you know they're

991
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:46,348
smoking weed and they're promoting weed

992
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:48,269
and it's promoting it to the kids well

993
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:50,099
say well what about all the beer

994
00:36:48,268 --> 00:36:52,048
commercials you have out here we're all

995
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:54,028
other damn Coors Light you passed down

996
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:55,380
in the stadium they see daddy drink all

997
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:57,599
the time and daddy gets mad selling yeah

998
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,298
mom that's a problem but you don't see

999
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,259
daddy smoke weed and going yell at mommy

1000
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:02,998
you know I mean I'm not just being

1001
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:05,248
advocate in that on that fashion but I

1002
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:06,718
mean just from from plain and simple

1003
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:08,669
just looking at what's going on I think

1004
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:12,079
this need to step up and say you know

1005
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,519
what this is the problem let's fix it

1006
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,539
I mean it's just it's gonna come from

1007
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,829
the community that people who are

1008
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:17,599
actually living it like living in the

1009
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:19,069
pain that are using it they have to use

1010
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,690
a proper language and their speaking and

1011
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,340
sort of convince people that this is the

1012
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,510
right way to go that or we get the

1013
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,769
fighters to go out there and say if you

1014
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,770
don't take this I'm gonna kick your ass

1015
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:39,529
oh yeah I wrote a letter to Roger Dale

1016
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:41,329
just stating that as I'm like I said I'm

1017
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,590
a nerd so I had to learn stuff so once I

1018
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:44,420
started learning and going through all

1019
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,769
these information I had some time

1020
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,630
members that were going through

1021
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:50,030
chemotherapy and I noticed the huge

1022
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:51,740
benefits of cannabis with with

1023
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,810
chemotherapy and cancer patients and

1024
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:55,039
help them relieve pain like well victim

1025
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:56,599
relieve pain for cancer then they can

1026
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,329
relieve pain for my guys coming off of

1027
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,319
an ACL injury because of the pain it

1028
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:01,579
makes you apprehensive when you

1029
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,019
apprehensive you play slower when you

1030
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,880
play slower more accessable get another

1031
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:06,170
injury so they want you to play fast at

1032
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,340
a high level without thinking so in

1033
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:11,180
order to do that you have to disregard

1034
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:12,710
your body pain receptors so I put all

1035
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:13,849
that in the letter sticking to roger

1036
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,619
goodell this is the things that we

1037
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:17,989
preach in the locker room you know play

1038
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:18,859
fast play hard play smart you can't do

1039
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:19,939
that when you're contracting on your

1040
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,740
injuries and then when you're taking all

1041
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,940
these other drugs makes you the Thar

1042
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:26,899
Jake it makes you dull sluggish moody

1043
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,130
last thing you want is the quarterback

1044
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,240
to be pissed off at you and moody and

1045
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,039
then you're not getting the ball you say

1046
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:32,179
something to him that he doesn't like in

1047
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:33,590
the locker room and you go on the field

1048
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:34,969
and now he's not throwing the ball to

1049
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,140
and you wonder why so cuz he's pissed at

1050
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:37,369
you why he's pissed I don't know his

1051
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:40,849
hormones are off he's taking all these

1052
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:41,960
damn pain meds so I'm talking about your

1053
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:43,279
Dillon saying that you know there's a

1054
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,980
huge issue with this a lot of the

1055
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,630
players are looking to fight these pain

1056
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,159
problems they have a lot of the alumni

1057
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,869
are suing the NFL because of all the

1058
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,949
payments they took and all the Stewart

1059
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:53,599
and Gentry to give them the cortisone

1060
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:54,949
shots to their knees then just cause

1061
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,869
their needs to go out if you look at the

1062
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:58,969
older players they're they walk like the

1063
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:00,319
Frankenstein and then it's sad to see

1064
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:03,199
that they didn't have the same type of

1065
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,760
opportunities that we do now as far as

1066
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,639
the medical science involved with

1067
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,520
cannabis and I think that CVD is gonna

1068
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:11,690
be the lifesaver of the NFL when they

1069
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,250
start implementing and they did take it

1070
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:15,920
off the bat stuff so this and out so CVD

1071
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:17,599
is off the band stuff this NFL so

1072
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,159
they're able to take CBD but it has to

1073
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,409
be I think hemp derived belief not

1074
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:23,269
mistaken so but the THC levels are still

1075
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:25,139
something that they monitor and NFL and

1076
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:26,759
I think that once they learn that

1077
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:29,250
it's less of a headache if you allow

1078
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,600
them to smoke weed then if you take that

1079
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,309
away from them and they resort to other

1080
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,589
ways of curing the pain because I know

1081
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:35,429
there's a lot of athletes that give TRO

1082
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:37,470
for DUIs

1083
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:38,609
because it's legal to drink and when

1084
00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:39,719
your body hurts you're just gonna drink

1085
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,610
a lot to dull the pain

1086
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,929
within that alcohol stays in your system

1087
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:45,300
the next day and the day after that now

1088
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:46,559
your your brain is catching up and then

1089
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,380
your body's still catching up and then

1090
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:50,099
you're going into another week of pain

1091
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,630
bringing the baggage from the week

1092
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:54,750
before so I think that once they learn

1093
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:57,900
that cannabis is the solution as far as

1094
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:00,119
helping your body it's just it's as

1095
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,500
better overall and Roger Goodell didn't

1096
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,059
respond to me so I keep harassing him

1097
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,300
every time so every time every chance I

1098
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:04,679
get

1099
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,600
Peter asked me to come and speak about

1100
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:08,429
this does they put me on camera I

1101
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,750
mention it because it's something I've

1102
00:40:08,429 --> 00:40:10,980
got to put pressure on them to see that

1103
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,869
there's people there advocating for it

1104
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,880
not because we're pot heads that's what

1105
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,989
their favorite go-to is oh we were pot

1106
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,700
head it's most like when Trump's like

1107
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:19,439
close to witch-hunt now let's just get

1108
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:20,699
down to what it really is you know it's

1109
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,079
something that's going to help everybody

1110
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:23,759
as a whole so let's start learning about

1111
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,199
it talking about it being more open

1112
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,000
about it so that we can get the people

1113
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,259
that need it the best help they can they

1114
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,210
can get this out there on the market

1115
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,490
he might I had a question for you I mean

1116
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:34,349
you know I mentioned earlier

1117
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:36,629
dealing with a couple NFL teams and

1118
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:39,329
seeing the same play you know these

1119
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:41,640
doctors who were you know kind of

1120
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:43,949
excited to be whatever around whatever

1121
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,480
the various teams and and and I'm just

1122
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:47,489
curious if you can talk at the player

1123
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,380
what did you see in terms of the

1124
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:51,149
doctor-patient relationship I mean how

1125
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,220
much how much were the drugs just being

1126
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,930
distributed by the trainer's or just

1127
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:57,239
there for you and how much was there

1128
00:40:54,929 --> 00:40:59,669
really medical oversight not much

1129
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,529
medical oversight as I got later on in

1130
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,789
my career you know they did doron 2009

1131
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,560
to 11

1132
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:06,119
they stopped allowing certain drugs to

1133
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,920
be in the locker room and then he had to

1134
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,230
sign there's more of clearance to get it

1135
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,000
no evaluation signed a waiver or whatnot

1136
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,050
but um I think that was just a code

1137
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,210
they're asked not because they really

1138
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:18,539
cared about you

1139
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:20,010
but there's a lot of it's funny the the

1140
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:22,920
doctor actually feels the power of

1141
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:24,540
having multi-million dollar athletes

1142
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,980
depend on them for something to make

1143
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:29,279
them feel good that's this sort of like

1144
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,440
the the the drug pusher versus the user

1145
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,050
kind of relationship I think that the

1146
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,789
some of the doctors really gloated in

1147
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,410
the fact that they had that power to you

1148
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:39,420
know those guys

1149
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:40,708
future hall-of-famer but he's knees are

1150
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,088
hurting so I give him this and he feels

1151
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:44,879
good he plays good because I gave him

1152
00:41:42,088 --> 00:41:45,869
his medicine so it's sort of positive

1153
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,160
reinforcement in their minds that

1154
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:48,420
they're doing the right thing but

1155
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:50,068
they're not seeing the the long-term

1156
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,318
effects of that with just getting the

1157
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:54,599
the temporary glory of being the drug

1158
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:56,400
pusher as opposed to your actual medical

1159
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:58,680
overseer you know the oversight wasn't

1160
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,088
there and I'm I think a couple couple

1161
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:01,498
doctor started get in trouble where they

1162
00:42:00,088 --> 00:42:05,009
started to actually look into the books

1163
00:42:01,498 --> 00:42:06,958
and see what's going on and it became

1164
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:08,458
more of a pressing issue especially

1165
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:10,618
after the concussion issues they started

1166
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:13,858
looking at medical overall as a whole in

1167
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:15,630
the in the league and I think now it's a

1168
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:16,828
little more regulated there's a little

1169
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:19,559
less that they give but it's still

1170
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:21,059
opiate based and it's something that

1171
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:23,579
they're just the the drug companies I

1172
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:25,079
think give them directly access to the

1173
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:28,318
locker rooms and they just give them the

1174
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,489
product I mean it's in there you know I

1175
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:32,400
have a question for you I'm glad you're

1176
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:35,909
up here actually it seems to me just

1177
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,619
from my simplistic way of looking at it

1178
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:39,058
that it's kind of like a two-pronged

1179
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,999
attack that needs to take place of

1180
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:43,259
changing their perspective but also

1181
00:42:40,998 --> 00:42:44,998
battling all the money with a big farm

1182
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:48,690
and all that stuff how realistic is it

1183
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:50,308
and the NFL for example of changing the

1184
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:53,400
way that they deal with with things like

1185
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:55,140
cannabis I think there's a structural

1186
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,108
problem here right it definitely is the

1187
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:59,969
money is is crazy you know we're not we

1188
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:02,219
don't talk about we talk about sort of

1189
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:04,229
the greed of the big pharma you know 20

1190
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:06,749
15 20 years ago but we don't talk about

1191
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:09,868
how much big pharma is still spending to

1192
00:43:06,748 --> 00:43:11,098
keep the pressure on so I do think I do

1193
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:12,390
think we need it needs to be a

1194
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:14,160
multi-pronged attack I mean I was

1195
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:16,558
talking earlier about public awareness

1196
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,989
and advocacy but I also do think I

1197
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:21,180
thought you know bringing brick going to

1198
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:24,329
the courts we've seen how effective that

1199
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:26,698
was in the in the concussion litigation

1200
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:28,709
in the NFL we've seen we currently have

1201
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:31,079
Bobby these opioid lawsuits are going to

1202
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:32,818
make a difference and I think actually

1203
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,910
drawing attention whether it's former

1204
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:36,980
players and you know wherever it is you

1205
00:43:35,909 --> 00:43:39,349
know drawing attention you

1206
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,789
the quartz is it's just another credible

1207
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:42,618
way to do it but I do think it's going

1208
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:44,389
to be a constant battle because there is

1209
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:48,470
no Lobby in this country spending more

1210
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:51,009
money throwing more more people at and

1211
00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:53,089
favourable treatment than Big Pharma

1212
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:55,010
yeah I was actually a part of the

1213
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:57,740
amendment commercial it was gonna be the

1214
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:59,119
first cannabis commercial ever on TV but

1215
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:00,289
the network's didn't allow it I think

1216
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,400
because some of the other pharmaceutical

1217
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:03,710
companies they have their commercial

1218
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,900
ring on the saying st. platforms didn't

1219
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:07,639
like the the separation and how it was

1220
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,320
shot because the commercial was shot to

1221
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:11,539
show you the the laws that have happened

1222
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:14,300
throughout the course of our country's

1223
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:16,070
history and also how medical marijuana

1224
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,380
and recreational cannabis also are

1225
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,390
contributing to the the tax platform and

1226
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,160
reshaping the way we think about what

1227
00:44:20,389 --> 00:44:23,900
the normal is so is it normal to be

1228
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,149
drugged up on these drugs that if you

1229
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,650
look at Humira it's got 10,000 side

1230
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,789
effects I mean you're gonna fix this

1231
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,619
problem and give me ten thousand other

1232
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:32,150
problems I'm just gonna smoke weed I

1233
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:33,260
mean in my head that's from thinking and

1234
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:35,210
that's what a lot of people are going to

1235
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,190
start to see once they realize that

1236
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,119
cannabis is a better solution you're

1237
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:39,858
gonna see form several companies

1238
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:41,269
spending money on counter attach to try

1239
00:44:39,858 --> 00:44:43,730
to suppress that information because I

1240
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:45,380
see happening now where I'm in the

1241
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,670
brokering space of brokering the

1242
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,800
commodities in the cannabis space well

1243
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:50,630
you see a lot of pharmaceutical

1244
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,269
companies have their misinformation so

1245
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:55,250
there was a misinformation about CBD

1246
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:57,079
coming from China they said all those

1247
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:59,690
metals in it are as bad or as fentanyl

1248
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:01,279
or it's contaminated it's not good when

1249
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,720
actuality was testing out at a higher

1250
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,760
percentage than the domestic product was

1251
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,379
but it was just a way for them to ensure

1252
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,820
that the market would be flooded with

1253
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,260
more product that can compete with their

1254
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,090
their medicines that they're trying to

1255
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:12,890
peddle themselves yeah I was going to

1256
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:16,039
say at the point we're gonna see the

1257
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:17,779
flip come as soon as the the DEA control

1258
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:20,210
Substances Act changes and makes

1259
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,850
cannabis scheduled to controlled

1260
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:24,050
substance and and big pharma that you

1261
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:26,690
know as big pharmaceuticals would start

1262
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:28,460
acquiring all these cannabis startups

1263
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,409
and that's when we're gonna see the flip

1264
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,119
happen but until then yeah exactly is

1265
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:33,980
your state we're just saying we don't

1266
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,680
want impediment after another how close

1267
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:39,199
is that it's happening that's a

1268
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:40,788
as the data requested yeah I you know

1269
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,679
the rumor the room I've been hearing a

1270
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:45,500
rumor that the Trump administration is

1271
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:49,940
kind of saving a you know Hail Mary or

1272
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:52,849
not but for the pre-election pre 2022 to

1273
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:54,500
make a change in the status I think most

1274
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:56,088
people think it's going to be within the

1275
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,068
next we're not more than five years away

1276
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:59,960
but another piece that's important

1277
00:45:58,068 --> 00:46:02,929
remember is that a legal infrastructure

1278
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,119
that makes cannabis that criminalizes

1279
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:06,558
cannabis is not is it starts with the

1280
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,630
Controlled Substances Act but it's also

1281
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,548
the Bank Secrecy Act and it's a whole

1282
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,990
series of federal laws that need to

1283
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:13,849
change to make it to create an

1284
00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:15,500
environment in which cannabis is

1285
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:17,750
normalized or dead like everything that

1286
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,969
you know every other form of medicines

1287
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,949
country I'm a super conspiracy theorist

1288
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:23,838
and I swear that the pharmaceutical

1289
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:26,328
companies are waiting or they're in

1290
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:28,338
cahoots with the scheduling process in

1291
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:29,660
order to prevent it from going to the

1292
00:46:28,338 --> 00:46:31,068
schedule to until they have their

1293
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:33,379
patents to think that are designing now

1294
00:46:31,068 --> 00:46:35,028
because if you can corner the market

1295
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,140
before it becomes a market then you're

1296
00:46:35,028 --> 00:46:37,489
already light-years ahead of every other

1297
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:40,190
small company that can come in there and

1298
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:41,899
try to take over a market share so I

1299
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:42,889
think that a lot of companies g ee

1300
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,510
pharmaceutical is the one that gonna

1301
00:46:42,889 --> 00:46:46,250
coming up a dialects there are light

1302
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,270
years ahead everybody else so the other

1303
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:50,449
companies are trying to compete with

1304
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:52,159
them are gonna try to sort of stall the

1305
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:53,778
ability for the rest of the small people

1306
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,489
to come in and get patents on items so

1307
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:56,750
that they can get depends first then you

1308
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:59,058
roll out to market and then they're able

1309
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:01,338
to corner it like they are in cornering

1310
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:03,079
mail to opiate market how strong how

1311
00:47:01,338 --> 00:47:04,969
strong are the other lobbying efforts on

1312
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:06,470
the cannabis side of things you know

1313
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:08,778
there's a lot of work to be done it's

1314
00:47:06,469 --> 00:47:11,719
it's unfortunately it's not canada the

1315
00:47:08,778 --> 00:47:13,940
cannabis you know community has not just

1316
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:17,058
hasn't put the money and put the people

1317
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:18,559
in place to prefer the kind of lobbying

1318
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:21,440
that we mean that that's certainly it's

1319
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,539
a huge a huge effort that we still need

1320
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,059
i think we're seeing more some so to

1321
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:27,770
some extent in the state in the state

1322
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:29,000
you know in the various state capitals

1323
00:47:27,769 --> 00:47:30,259
we're seeing more but it's getting

1324
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,969
better but there's a long way to go

1325
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,980
that's why for me the hope you are

1326
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:35,480
talking about the opioid crisis is a way

1327
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,219
of sort of forcing pressure because when

1328
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,150
you look at you ask why did Congress

1329
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:42,849
finally turn on hem sores

1330
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:44,800
cannabinoids in the farm bill I don't

1331
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:47,409
think it was I don't think it was great

1332
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,130
activist lobbying by the cannabis

1333
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:53,170
community as much as it was just the the

1334
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:55,030
absurdity of the tragedy of keeping

1335
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,889
keeping people from doing research that

1336
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:59,470
needs to be done and creating and

1337
00:47:56,889 --> 00:48:03,599
blocking access to a therapeutic at a

1338
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:03,599
time when people are dying from opioids

1339
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:12,339
that's you know that's it so these

1340
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:14,350
scheduling or rescheduling is a huge it

1341
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,150
depends are you on the medical are you

1342
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,619
are you know the adult use community

1343
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:20,289
obviously they're pushed for

1344
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:21,759
recreational cannabis it was the move

1345
00:48:20,289 --> 00:48:24,880
for be scheduling right treating

1346
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,820
cannabis like up all you know personally

1347
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,980
I spent a lot of time working on medical

1348
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:33,100
therapeutic uses and I don't know why we

1349
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:35,260
can't have both but but I would like to

1350
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:37,150
see the cannabis treated as serious

1351
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,560
medicine because I think that's what's

1352
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,849
going to put the funding whether you

1353
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,070
know whether it's academic medical

1354
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:44,259
centers or Big Pharma putting the money

1355
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:46,690
into really understanding and unlocking

1356
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:49,270
the potential so personally I'm going to

1357
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:51,690
rescheduling a ban but I realized

1358
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:54,009
there's room for multiple viewpoints I

1359
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:56,440
would be a disgusting fan just to the

1360
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,610
fact that for the baking aspect of it I

1361
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,840
mean there's a lot of good people that

1362
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,849
have good companies that are doing good

1363
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,460
business to put good product out there

1364
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:04,449
and the the scheduling is what's causing

1365
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,690
the banging issues because these

1366
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:09,519
federally insured banks are not allowed

1367
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:11,710
to honor the Bank Secrecy Act to deal

1368
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,539
with cannabis companies and the CBD

1369
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,369
companies and even though see these CBD

1370
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:18,070
is 50 state legal it's still being

1371
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:20,380
treated as if it's its THC so there's a

1372
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:22,570
lot of misinformation or apprehension or

1373
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,360
to prevent people from getting their

1374
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:26,920
traditional bank accounts so I think we

1375
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,140
can really see a positive growth in our

1376
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,550
GDP with dee scheduling because then if

1377
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:32,529
you're able to do schedule it then banks

1378
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:35,110
can go and set that money then you get

1379
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:35,860
the tax revenue you get businesses that

1380
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,809
aren't up and running you have

1381
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,490
employment that goes up because there's

1382
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:41,559
more jobs more bud tenders out there to

1383
00:49:39,489 --> 00:49:42,669
be able to help you get high so I think

1384
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:45,719
it's a I think that would be a good

1385
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,720
thing for the community as a whole

1386
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:50,480
the reasons why don't put ballplayers

1387
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:52,190
maybe shouldn't have access to teach

1388
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,440
feeling that stigma around it right

1389
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,909
because they give us heroes but I

1390
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,789
actually think that there's an

1391
00:49:55,909 --> 00:50:02,690
opportunity to talk about teenagers that

1392
00:49:58,789 --> 00:50:04,849
play sports that like football like MMA

1393
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:06,860
right they have a developing brain and

1394
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:09,829
it's getting injured so you know is

1395
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:12,079
there what are your views on cannabis or

1396
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:13,639
CBD youth in teenagers our game had a

1397
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:17,049
new head injuries should we be getting

1398
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:18,980
CBD - you know varsity football players

1399
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:20,240
yeah I think that was one of the

1400
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,579
concerns that they were talking about

1401
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,669
was the fact that there's teenagers that

1402
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:27,170
are using it and does it cause issues

1403
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:30,260
psychosocial issues or or mental health

1404
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:31,930
issues involved with use and I know that

1405
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:35,000
the apprehension was there they were

1406
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:36,799
thinking I think they said was the brain

1407
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,300
is still developing so it doesn't react

1408
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,490
the same way as I Ventura brain does

1409
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,560
with THC so I don't know what their

1410
00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:43,729
conclusion was on that but I mean if

1411
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,230
you're gonna play football at that young

1412
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:46,460
of age I had guys that when I was in

1413
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:48,380
high school that were smoking weed that

1414
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,030
were part of the fastest on the team and

1415
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,050
they were always on they were always on

1416
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,400
the field they were playing and they

1417
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,359
were good their grades weren't good

1418
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,590
because they weren't putting the effort

1419
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:55,819
in class because they were knuckleheads

1420
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,090
but I don't think was because of weed

1421
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:02,240
smoking but um I personally think that

1422
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:06,108
there's younger adults who may have been

1423
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:09,649
a benefit from using cannabis whether it

1424
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:11,420
be CBD or THC and I'm a proponent for it

1425
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,829
because I think that if we're gonna do

1426
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,930
the damage and if there's a way to fix

1427
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:19,250
it then I mean should also be offered -

1428
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:22,460
yeah yeah that's a tricky one right

1429
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:27,230
because uh you know I we kind of get

1430
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:29,480
into the medical aspects of it of you

1431
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:31,789
know how does it affect a developing

1432
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:35,000
brain and and all that stuff I don't

1433
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:37,099
know enough about that but you know I

1434
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,940
think like anything else it's how it's

1435
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:44,329
used and how responsible they are you

1436
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:46,340
know I'm not a big proponent for young

1437
00:51:44,329 --> 00:51:48,889
kids hitting each other in the head

1438
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:51,108
full-on getting ready to be a mixed

1439
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:53,750
martial artist but I think that should

1440
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:56,230
probably come a little bit later again

1441
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:58,079
because of the developing brain so

1442
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:00,179
that's that

1443
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,349
a tricky one yeah it's funny I've been

1444
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:02,940
playing football since I was 12 years

1445
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:05,670
old so I could even count how many

1446
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:08,720
concussions I've probably had so I don't

1447
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:12,690
know if it uh yeah I'll leave it there a

1448
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:15,539
lot well thank you guys very much I

1449
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:19,970
appreciate it and we will get this video

1450
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:19,969
