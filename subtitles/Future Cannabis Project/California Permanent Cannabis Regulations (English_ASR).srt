2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,388
we were talking about the politics of

3
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:15,719
real estate on my part

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,969
and situated yourself in a in a

5
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:21,140
multi-tenant unit and getting approval

6
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:23,969
of an association and vetting CC&amp;R

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:27,359
people forget all the time

8
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:29,339
the importance they think of those and

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,700
the limitations of those I think this my

10
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,859
landlords misrepresent and put into a

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,290
lease you know that you've acknowledged

12
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,269
and received the CCR's and that they

13
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,869
shouldn't be a problem and then forget

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,250
that certain tenants are in the

15
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:46,919
association that may in fact have a

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,558
problem with cannabis and then all of

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,730
the sudden you're in a pickle where you

18
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:55,409
can't get the property authorizations

19
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:57,479
that you need and this has got to be

20
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:00,148
understood not just by operators I think

21
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,558
quite often landlords may perhaps be in

22
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,390
a position in this represent or

23
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,459
mischaracterize what exactly the

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,560
opportunity is there for tenants and

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,780
also from the perspective of municipal

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,670
authorities they quite often are looking

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,460
at an application that looks good on its

28
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,799
face I would say most notably back in

29
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,649
Santa Anna based on the initial lottery

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,950
applicants there was one I believe

31
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,420
prominent rapper with with a veteran

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,130
status in the cannabis community who

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,930
shall not be named and it's my

34
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:29,728
understanding that there was an

35
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,799
association that also prevented him from

36
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:32,969
opening on time I think we can talk

37
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,240
about what needs to go into release

38
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:37,920
right it's it's the state wants to see

39
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,109
that not only are you doing cannabis

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,420
operations but that the specific

41
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,739
cannabis operation and the specific

42
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,170
commercial cannabis activity you're

43
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:49,849
conducting at that facility and we've

44
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:53,519
had as the annual licenses go forward

45
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:55,649
landlords holding hostage these Express

46
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,810
notarization forms that you need in

47
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,090
order to be processed they can ask for

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,618
more money they can ask for equity

49
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,930
because at the end of the day you're

50
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,269
stalled and can't move forward without

51
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,540
these so if you don't build that into

52
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:09,879
the lease that

53
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,670
says this is exactly what I'm doing any

54
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,069
and all necessary documentation that I

55
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:17,469
may need as I continue with this process

56
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:22,239
even during renewals sometimes the

57
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:24,879
city's asked for updated notarized proof

58
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,469
of ownership and an acknowledgement of

59
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,939
what you're doing at that facility and

60
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:29,259
all of a sudden you go back to the

61
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,270
landlord and ask for this information

62
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:33,280
and they say well I didn't agree to do

63
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,680
that and now it's gonna cost you ax and

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,810
you have no maneuverability so I think

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,849
these are going back to the ABCs of

66
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:44,740
cleaning up your all of your documents

67
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:46,629
that you need now that we know exactly

68
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,879
what an annual application is and

69
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:51,430
there's no temporary relief and so

70
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,500
there's this expiration of all of these

71
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,080
temporary permits which we can also talk

72
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,939
about when should you apply if you're an

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,280
operator I think there's this nice

74
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:03,520
poison pill that the agencies gave by

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,770
saying you have some operators until

76
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,670
August to get done now

77
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:12,070
it was taking CDFA is a great example

78
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:15,189
voice four to eight weeks to process a

79
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,750
temporary permit primarily time

80
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:18,669
dedicated towards the science team

81
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,199
vetting a lot of the premise diagrams

82
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:25,958
and water quality control program

83
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,729
membership on participation and and that

84
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,950
was understandable that that was a

85
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:32,649
perhaps a high hurdle for many or a

86
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:34,509
filter for many applications to have to

87
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,789
meet before moving forward with their

88
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:38,620
temporaries but but it's but very

89
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:40,030
interesting how how the licensing

90
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,150
authorities and the staff assigned are

91
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,680
gonna be able to process annuals and and

92
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,390
then there's this provisional license

93
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,730
type that that we understand is there in

94
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:51,159
statute and there in theory but we

95
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:53,469
haven't yet seen them being issued and

96
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:55,060
of course with provisional it's a whole

97
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:56,500
even though it's not manual it's a whole

98
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,330
different kettle of fish because it does

99
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,120
require participation within the metric

100
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,940
system and sequa compliance in order for

101
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,950
you to get one so if you weren't already

102
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:09,359
going through your sequel process and

103
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:13,209
you're somewhere they like la city of

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:17,079
San Diego or city of Long Beach where

105
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,889
there was no local authorization with

106
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,569
regard to sequel there was no to term

107
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,460
nation that was made there was no

108
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:25,009
secondary land use discretionary action

109
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:28,339
that would trigger that you're not

110
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:33,680
engaged actively in sequin ow that is

111
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:36,378
more of a concern from the BCC camp who

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,288
in their permanent regulations added

113
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,999
five pages in to new forms with regard

114
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:43,128
to sequin and for those of you who don't

115
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:45,919
know what that lovely acronym is that's

116
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:49,490
the California Environmental Quality Act

117
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,468
and so if you're going through that and

118
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,360
you want a provisional which we know

119
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:56,300
only two out of the three agencies are

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,038
even considering and that's PCC and CDFA

121
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,319
you need to be dealing with those issues

122
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,778
and you need to be engaged actively in

123
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,039
early with the agency otherwise you're

124
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:06,978
going to be put to the back of that

125
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:09,800
licensing agents pile and if it's taking

126
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:11,149
four to six weeks to process and you

127
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,449
have to go back and forth with that

128
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:16,008
agency if you wait and you're

129
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:18,680
terminating in August and you don't

130
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,270
start until May you may not get

131
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,338
processed and if you're not processed

132
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:24,079
there is no extension of a temporary

133
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:26,088
there's a shutting down of your business

134
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,778
so you have to start that engagement

135
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:30,978
early and I don't think operators are

136
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:33,560
understanding or heating that warning

137
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:36,378
and if they get backed up and you don't

138
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,259
get that approval there is no other

139
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:42,740
recourse or mechanism for you to rely on

140
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:45,319
anymore so if you are in process with a

141
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,990
locality and you're getting your Cu P

142
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,819
the time to start your annual is once

143
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,949
you get that CU P and you're going

144
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:54,020
through t eyes you can go back and forth

145
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:58,370
you can have a great conversation in

146
00:05:54,019 --> 00:06:01,068
fact with the regulator to say is this

147
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,509
lawful am i putting this wall here am i

148
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,000
designing this correctly because

149
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:08,028
otherwise when they come they can say

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,408
you need to redo and that means you're

151
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:12,649
shutting down and not getting your

152
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:15,740
permit so active early continuous

153
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:18,829
engagement do not rely on that temporary

154
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,060
taking you out and not starting the

155
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:24,258
process until four to five weeks before

156
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,028
because all you're doing is putting

157
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,649
yourself in a pot of boiling water that

158
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:29,420
you may not be able to get out the other

159
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:30,709
timing issue and

160
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,110
connects to sequel from up from a

161
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:39,769
different perspective on the issue of

162
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:41,199
environmental authorization is is also

163
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:44,120
gonna occur this summer and that is

164
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,670
believe July 1st is the final date with

165
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,590
which our municipalities can offer their

166
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,600
their complete comprehensive ordinance

167
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:54,379
and not be required to do a programmatic

168
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,860
review of their cannabis framework at

169
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:00,290
the local level this is due to a

170
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,720
compromise that was embedded in SB 94

171
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:06,170
which which unified the prop 64 elements

172
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,930
with the prior Micajah elements and and

173
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:11,780
what you see as many jurisdictions were

174
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,610
blissfully passing ordinances thinking

175
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:15,829
that the very difficult work for doing a

176
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,740
complete sequin alysus or environmental

177
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:21,159
analysis of some sort on on their local

178
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:25,340
program was not necessary now that

179
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,960
extension is is contingent upon a couple

180
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:28,939
of things first the discretionary review

181
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,549
has to be pushed down onto the project

182
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:33,860
level which has been a very high bharden

183
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,170
for for many applicants to clear

184
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,420
particularly with cultivation where you

185
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,970
have all of a sudden the need to do

186
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,800
biological archaeological assessments

187
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,590
obviously water is going to be an issue

188
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,660
as well as looking at on granular

189
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:49,519
elements of the cultivation plan but in

190
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,930
terms of engagement and engagement not

191
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,099
just what the state authorities but

192
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,740
engagement also with your local

193
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,629
authorities I think it's helpful to

194
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,280
consider that that we've only seen

195
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:00,529
extinction-level events happen to

196
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,359
operators thus far or prospective

197
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:04,579
operators but it could be the case that

198
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,009
we're seeing extinction-level events at

199
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:09,709
the municipal level where municipalities

200
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:11,629
that may have in good faith been

201
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:15,469
thinking that they were gonna wait until

202
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:17,870
other municipalities had had begun to

203
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,540
suss out how to regulate it and waited

204
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,949
until state regulations became a little

205
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,110
bit more solidified before moving

206
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:25,250
forward with their local program frankly

207
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,020
if they haven't gone through their

208
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,180
Planning Commission and if they haven't

209
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:31,250
gone through their their local council

210
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,649
approval process if they haven't

211
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,259
completed this by July 1st keep in mind

212
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,990
that quite often June on City Council's

213
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,639
and arc

214
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,200
and don't have any meetings whatsoever

215
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,970
they have not completed this

216
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,690
comprehensive ordinance process by July

217
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:48,330
1st that may extend enormously the

218
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,730
amount of effort necessary to to develop

219
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,050
a municipal ordinance framework so it

220
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,279
could cost upwards of several million

221
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:56,269
dollars to do the appropriate

222
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,529
environmental analysis on ordinance and

223
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,299
perhaps if you look at some of the

224
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:02,129
sequel analyses that are happening at

225
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:04,109
the county level and either Yolo or

226
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:07,649
Santa Barbara those are very extended

227
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,180
processes and and I frankly think that a

228
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:10,799
lot of municipalities may just wash

229
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,049
their hands and say we don't want to do

230
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,250
this environmental review of an

231
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:25,409
ordinance so that could be yet another

232
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:27,480
extinction level event that we have yes

233
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:30,719
exactly this palace that may have

234
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,639
anticipated on permissibly granting

235
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,070
licenses and may have even passed a

236
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,689
local tax anticipating those revenues

237
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,879
but if they don't have their their ducks

238
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,980
in a row on their ordinance by July 1st

239
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,689
it will be extremely difficult for them

240
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,580
to pass an ordinance to allow for those

241
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,350
tax revenues to manifest right they

242
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,770
couldn't just simply push off the

243
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,389
environmental review onto the individual

244
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:54,269
projects at that point they would need

245
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:56,610
to take review of their actual ordinance

246
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:58,889
and in that it's important to note that

247
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,169
in counties that cultivate it's easier

248
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:04,759
they can in fact if they want tear off

249
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:08,069
of the programmatic er that was done for

250
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:10,200
CDFA at the state level now with the

251
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:15,070
water provider with the winning producer

252
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:18,610
but both Santa Barbara and I believe

253
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:22,060
Yolo found differently findings than the

254
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,680
programmatic EIS interesting is those

255
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:26,919
jurisdictions that want to engage in

256
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:30,789
activities from CV pH manufacturing or

257
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:32,979
BCC more importantly cannot tear off of

258
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:34,419
an environmental review document that

259
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,070
was produced by the state because the

260
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:40,449
state produced a negative declaration

261
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:42,879
that no impact potentially concerning

262
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,370
impacts would apply and if you are in

263
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,799
fact only regulating let's say

264
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,620
distribution and non storefront delivery

265
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,179
well you've just gotten yourself into a

266
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,039
sticky wicket with an environmental

267
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:56,259
impact because you are putting a

268
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:59,079
tremendous amount of cars and light-duty

269
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:02,289
trucks on the road that potentially has

270
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,670
a significant impact on that needs to be

271
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:05,110
addressed from an air quality

272
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:06,759
perspective and from a traffic

273
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,980
perspective and so now it's not just the

274
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,860
individual projects but the project as a

275
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,019
whole that these localities need to look

276
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,180
at and if you're an operator working in

277
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:18,340
one of these localities that is starting

278
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:19,899
to come online with the process remind

279
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,910
them that you need an environmental

280
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,959
determination that it's somewhere along

281
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:24,669
the line there needs to be a

282
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,620
discretionary action that leads the city

283
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:28,000
to give your project an environmental

284
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,100
determination whether it's a negative

285
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,039
declaration whether it's an exemption

286
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:37,029
applies or whether there needs to be an

287
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:39,939
N OD or an noe the situation because you

288
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,740
can take that to the agencies and show

289
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,440
that you've complied with sequel without

290
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,700
it you're sort of looking backwards and

291
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,140
maybe needing to do an environmental

292
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,140
assessment of your already existing

293
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:52,000
business in which you're able to then

294
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:54,309
get your annual license and since we

295
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,840
said that Provisionals are probably

296
00:11:54,309 --> 00:12:00,279
going to be allowed although we don't

297
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,050
know from CDFA to BCC part of a

298
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,329
provisional is that you're engaged in

299
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:06,939
the sequel process that is one of the

300
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:09,370
triggering event so sequa this silent

301
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,410
killer that is coming can be an

302
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,330
extinction-level event that most people

303
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:15,879
haven't been paying attention to and

304
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,100
have simply sort of passed it along and

305
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,840
oh that's an annual requirement at the

306
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,330
state level I'm not so much thinking

307
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,160
about it locally and although to be fair

308
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,278
it was perhaps difficult for many people

309
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,230
to begin the determination particular

310
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,269
thinking one business model that let's

311
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,430
go back to the annual regulations China

312
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:34,230
the permanent regulations and and the

313
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:35,789
idea of dynamic delivery how do you

314
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,800
really assess how do you do a vehicle

315
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:39,809
trip analysis if you don't understand

316
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,248
the frequency with which orders are

317
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:43,258
placed and whether that driver is

318
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:45,269
required to drive back to the hub or

319
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,430
they're allowed to get a phone call

320
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,649
every 30 minutes within a thirty minute

321
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:51,870
time period and be able to continue on

322
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:53,999
to the to the next destination in a

323
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:57,419
dynamic fashion it's very difficult I

324
00:12:53,999 --> 00:13:00,329
would argue to begin a vehicle trip

325
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:02,338
analysis until frankly until those

326
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:04,138
regulations were announced and we still

327
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,759
don't know whether they'll be challenged

328
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,318
in any sort of a litigation or any sort

329
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,149
of an appeal process by some of the

330
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:10,979
interested parties and that wasn't taken

331
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:14,278
into consideration in the BCC his

332
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,438
initial assessment of their regulations

333
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,509
right dynamic delivery came out after

334
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:21,528
the name Dec and I would they have an

335
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:23,730
impact on their own internal

336
00:13:21,528 --> 00:13:26,188
environmental review documents so we see

337
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,870
a lot of additional sequences that are

338
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:29,399
popping up around the state I think

339
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,500
you're gonna see them utilize more

340
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,169
they're utilized both by opposition and

341
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,909
I think from a favorable standpoint we

342
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:38,219
saw a lot of bands and urgency

343
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:40,198
ordinances I would argue that if you

344
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,540
have proliferation of a black market in

345
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:44,909
your city or an illicit market in your

346
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:47,299
jurisdiction that you could use sequin

347
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:50,578
to say that you were actively not

348
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:51,719
addressing the problem and that could

349
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:54,508
change your baseline and have a

350
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,160
significant impact to not regulate so we

351
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:57,959
may see sequel flipped around from

352
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,019
something that the opposition is using

353
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,938
to stall or prevent regulation to

354
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,240
something that is empowering local

355
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:08,250
cities that's going to be really

356
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,589
interesting for me to see how that's

357
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,198
being utilized but work with a good

358
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:15,120
sequa a tourney or somebody familiar

359
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,909
with sequa because there's magic

360
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,419
language in secret at how you draft

361
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:23,549
something to fall into a categorical or

362
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:26,998
a statutory exemption if one were to

363
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:28,919
apply and then working with a good

364
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:31,980
environmental engineering consulting

365
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:34,259
firm to get an air quality study that is

366
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,300
certified by an engineer to get a

367
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:37,500
traffic study these are all things that

368
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:40,319
you should be accounting

369
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,330
for in your budget process of going

370
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,040
through an application and I don't think

371
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,950
that that's ever been called out before

372
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:49,589
as clearly for operators and that may

373
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,330
put you in a situation to get behind the

374
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,360
eight-ball because a full sequel review

375
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:56,790
as any sequel or land use developer will

376
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,009
tell you can be three months real

377
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:01,589
favorably all the way out to 12 months

378
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:03,269
or longer depending on what pushback you

379
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,129
get and what findings are and while you

380
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:07,049
may be in the process of the land use

381
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:08,850
permitting authorization process at the

382
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:10,379
local level and that gets you in good

383
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,450
standing obviously to continue forward

384
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,649
with the state licensing authority at

385
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,180
the end of the day with the land use

386
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,649
processing authority should it not be

387
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,399
appealed and should ultimately be

388
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,379
approved

389
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,789
quite often particularly if it's

390
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:22,320
something along the lines of a

391
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:24,829
conditional use permit or a minor use

392
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,300
permit there then obviously conditionals

393
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,700
conditions attached conditions of

394
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:32,039
operation with some jurisdictions having

395
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,660
condition monitoring programs that are

396
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,849
an additional line item that you have to

397
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:37,559
factor in a consideration and some of

398
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,570
those conditions may also have

399
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,279
additional costs associated with them

400
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,950
I'm familiar with a couple of areas

401
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,679
where if you are in a really sweet spot

402
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,480
logistics wise and that you are on just

403
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,309
off of some sort of a highway or just

404
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,200
off of some sort of a thoroughfare there

405
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:55,199
could very realistically the road

406
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,600
mitigation fees offset better that are

407
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,820
embedded within the conditions on on the

408
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,460
project so that is yet another line item

409
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,260
that frankly unfortunately cannabis

410
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,839
operators all too often are deemed

411
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:09,779
second-class citizens so other business

412
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,880
models out there in California you know

413
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,529
a florist delivery service may not have

414
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:15,299
to pay a road mitigation fee but you'd

415
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:17,220
better be assured that the kitchen sink

416
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:19,799
is going to be built towards a cannabis

417
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,710
delivery operator simply because of you

418
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,838
know well we believe that these are

419
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,220
these operators made out of money so we

420
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,060
might as well bill and left right and

421
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:39,200
center yeah I think so what it Peter do

422
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:39,199
you anything you look like hi everyone

423
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,580
[Music]

424
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:58,239
so let's start with the deck organizers

425
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:01,838
but then move down the line like one or

426
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,789
two big changes or confirmations and the

427
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,038
permanent regs that affects that license

428
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:08,558
category and what you're hearing from

429
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:12,068
operators in that license category of

430
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:14,649
either oh shit or this is great or like

431
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:16,750
so let's start and sale of events it

432
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:20,690
sets up on her specific question is what

433
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:24,690
does and then get into the broader event

434
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,690
[Music]

435
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:31,600
Susan just for your birthday I think

436
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:33,279
it's an interesting conversation that

437
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,319
we're starting to see a lot of cities

438
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,408
grapple with especially getting closer

439
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:41,109
to 4/20 and wanting to have compliant

440
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:42,970
4/20 events San Francisco yesterday was

441
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:45,308
just dealing with this issue and his

442
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:48,759
local authorization cannot just be a

443
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:51,009
simple letter cannot be that the state

444
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:53,169
or the city says yes we're giving you

445
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:55,029
local authorization to do this event in

446
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:57,070
this place and it's a pilot program

447
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:59,649
while they get through regulation

448
00:17:57,069 --> 00:18:04,418
because as you have that 60 days that

449
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:06,909
you need to notify the BCC for we've got

450
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:09,070
this big industry holiday coming up and

451
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:12,100
what a great opportunity to show how a

452
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:15,038
bee 2020 works and how you do a

453
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:16,779
compliant event versus having a bunch of

454
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,690
non-compliant events because there's no

455
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:22,240
mechanism that's there for an event

456
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:24,130
organiser to go through the process so I

457
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,288
think that's very much an engaged

458
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,990
conversation that needs to happen per

459
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:31,329
local jurisdiction and that local

460
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:35,710
authorization is not defined other than

461
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:37,269
to be given the authority to do

462
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,220
something and I think we're gonna find

463
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:42,369
this specifically interesting with the

464
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,970
cultivation clarifications what does

465
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:46,678
that local authorization look like if

466
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,870
you and we can jump around back to

467
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,870
events but this is a nice safe way if

468
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:56,579
you were a cultivator that had multiple

469
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:59,158
licenses maybe only two not ten or 20 or

470
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:01,529
80 where you were aggregating your

471
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,450
nursery and your processing and now all

472
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:05,279
the sudden you're a small fish versus a

473
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:08,220
big fish and you still need to have

474
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:12,509
either separate processing for your

475
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,919
three premises versus a much larger

476
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:16,679
where you already have that designated

477
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,409
can the local jurisdiction who said you

478
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,419
can do nursery and processing just give

479
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:24,480
you local authorization and you get a

480
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:26,909
state permit for the activity without

481
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,700
getting an identifiable permit because

482
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:32,820
none of those local jurisdictions had a

483
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,580
processor license type when they first

484
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:37,349
agreed to give you your cultivation

485
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:39,178
license activity so if local

486
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:41,869
authorization is as simple as them

487
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:44,548
calling and a local jurisdiction

488
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:47,849
verifying or giving you a letter versus

489
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:49,798
having an ordinance that will go more

490
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:52,949
favourably both from an event standpoint

491
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:55,019
and from a cultivation standpoint back

492
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,538
with events though I really like the

493
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:59,819
retail to retail transfer because does

494
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:03,298
that allow you to send your product back

495
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:05,700
from your temporary retail location to

496
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:08,190
your brick-and-mortar retail location

497
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,870
because at the Emerald cup Laurie

498
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,558
specifically said well I don't think it

499
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:15,178
was the intent transported by the

500
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,700
distributor because it's just retail to

501
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,409
retail and it says by the other acts of

502
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,390
this division and that would mean that a

503
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:22,620
distributor would need to do it but that

504
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,220
you could send it back from your

505
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:27,839
temporary retail hub to your retail hub

506
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,150
because it doesn't say just sets under

507
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,220
the control of the same licensee and

508
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,230
that's gonna give a lot more flexibility

509
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,029
so that's presuming that you do indeed

510
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,069
have an event and that you do indeed

511
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:40,019
have a compliant event what do you do

512
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:41,579
with excess product hopefully you don't

513
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:43,349
have that problem at the end of your

514
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:44,819
event you've made good sales and

515
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:47,009
everybody had a great time with the

516
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:49,529
event but how do you host it first a

517
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:52,038
compliant event I think all too often

518
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:53,269
I'm looking at a lot of local ordinance

519
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:54,378
the reason why I'm talking about local

520
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:56,569
ordinance is because of this dual

521
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,548
license service structure that requires

522
00:20:56,569 --> 00:21:00,888
that local authorization first and

523
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:03,108
unfortunately many ordinances do call

524
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:05,028
out specifically and exclude the

525
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:07,939
possibility of having a cannabis event

526
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:09,919
of any sort however there's many other

527
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,019
local ordinances that if we can go back

528
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,049
to the sequel conversation and look what

529
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:16,548
what the what the impact what would the

530
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:19,179
impact upon the neighborhood would the

531
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:24,108
impact upon traffic is this really a

532
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:25,609
different event is a cannabis event

533
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,989
different than for instance a wedding as

534
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:28,128
a cannabis event different than for

535
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:30,590
instance a Bat Mitzvah

536
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:33,199
I mean is this is this really anything

537
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,878
so so out of the ordinary looking at it

538
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,348
purely from from the neighborhood impact

539
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:40,488
and the community impact so for

540
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:42,528
communities that may be amenable on

541
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:44,690
wondering whether there could be some

542
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,669
configuration of a local authorization

543
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,849
that could sort of tear off of off of

544
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:51,619
the impacts anticipated from other event

545
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:53,298
permitting on the pathways that are

546
00:21:51,618 --> 00:21:55,278
available for non cannabis events

547
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:59,658
because keep in mind you're not this is

548
00:21:55,278 --> 00:22:01,608
not the only party at play there also

549
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:03,559
has to be a licensed retailer there has

550
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:05,868
to be a licensed distributor so from the

551
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:07,848
perspective of the locality there is an

552
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:10,608
abundance of regulation that's going to

553
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:14,569
be attached to this event and we all

554
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:16,460
know that jurisdictions have pushed for

555
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:20,388
AV 2020 because not all jurisdictions

556
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:22,509
have state owned on DAA or County

557
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:24,348
Fairgrounds on within within their

558
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,729
jurisdictions and even if they do have

559
00:22:24,348 --> 00:22:27,618
in their jurisdictions sometimes there's

560
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:29,778
a dispute as towards who has

561
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:32,628
jurisdiction over those properties to

562
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:35,388
authorize and/or prohibit on events to

563
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:37,038
go forward so none of these cities are

564
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,808
ready for the implementation of the AV

565
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,970
2020 which is the build of Pamella

566
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:42,678
referred to that expand the scope of

567
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,200
permissible venues to any locally

568
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,690
authorized venue and I would really like

569
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,389
to see municipalities to not overthink

570
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:53,330
this and to simply tear off of existing

571
00:22:50,388 --> 00:22:55,158
event production pathways acknowledging

572
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:57,439
that cannabis in and of itself is not

573
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,129
what's being regulated or permitted it's

574
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,649
an event

575
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:03,949
with with a quantity of headcount of

576
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:05,189
persons and cars and impact and look at

577
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,490
it from that way rather than

578
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:11,549
something that's so exotic that it need

579
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:13,920
be to say comfortably familiarity breeds

580
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:16,769
comfort ability and they all have events

581
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,210
there is no city out of the 482 cities

582
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:20,639
and 58 counties in the state of

583
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:25,250
California that does not have an events

584
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:28,140
rhetoric built in to their municipal

585
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:30,240
regulatory authority they all do so if

586
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,250
you just put a widget where widget goes

587
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,339
then this is going to be a much easier

588
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:38,400
pathway and it's important because it

589
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:40,470
also serves as a conduit to show what

590
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,300
compliance sales education and

591
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,980
consumption look like that all of a

592
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:46,970
sudden if you have a positive event

593
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:49,259
experience you may then be more open to

594
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,680
regulating all aspects of the supply

595
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,750
chain

596
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,269
specifically retail because we're gonna

597
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,339
have an overproduction of the production

598
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:58,740
side of the supply chain then we have

599
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:02,009
retail outlets throughout the state so

600
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,620
the events rhetoric can really help to

601
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:08,099
facilitate good conversations and

602
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:12,089
education there is a new Events

603
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:14,909
Committee at CCI a which cochair me hi

604
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:16,139
everyone but I think that's an important

605
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,120
committee that people that are

606
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,590
interested in this both from an

607
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:21,899
operational standpoint and event

608
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:25,379
organizers to be involved with so we can

609
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:27,570
provide potential options avenues and

610
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,330
draft language that's going to make this

611
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:31,649
process easier and make the lifts easier

612
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:33,119
for the cities right because they're

613
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,710
grappling with the taxes they're

614
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,529
grappling with how do you regulate

615
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:40,230
operators and how you go through this

616
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:42,000
process to provide the tools and the

617
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,950
package and just going back to what

618
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,349
event organizers should do get your

619
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:49,200
event organizer license locate your

620
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:51,779
event location identify there you go

621
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,880
identify who your partners are and go to

622
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:56,549
the city with a comprehensive package

623
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,380
that says this is what I want to do here

624
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:00,599
are all the people that I have here is a

625
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,580
proposed premise diagram here's how I

626
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:05,549
think we should do local authorization

627
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:07,649
and understand what the framework for

628
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:09,960
events is already in that jurisdiction

629
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:12,330
you're operating in and sort of have an

630
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,640
open conversation with them yeah so that

631
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:16,659
you can get to a yes that's what's

632
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,630
happening up north and that's

633
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,670
that's certainly hopefully related to

634
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,590
the conversation that is being

635
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,390
acknowledged on statewide and is being

636
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:28,349
understood at the local level that there

637
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:30,820
is there's something there's some rocky

638
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:33,159
implementation experiences obviously of

639
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:35,409
things not moving forward as quickly as

640
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,410
possible and the unregulated market

641
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,150
being dominant frankly and I think

642
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:44,080
obviously with with the Sun setting of

643
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:46,030
SB 420 clause that allowed for the

644
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:49,289
collective sharing of medical cannabis

645
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:53,049
on amongst qualified patients that on in

646
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:54,909
in the situation of events obviously has

647
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:57,549
been local sash events and other sort of

648
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,230
collective consumption events frankly

649
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:01,389
cities should acknowledge that they they

650
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,339
might have messed up and and not been

651
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,500
sufficiently bold in regulating the

652
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:08,259
reality of cannabis consumption in

653
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,730
California and I think in the situation

654
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:11,619
of the local sessions that have now

655
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:14,920
found that I've stranded without the

656
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:16,479
affirmative defense of SB 420 if we

657
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,550
could treat these cannabis events as

658
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,920
something that already are there already

659
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:23,470
exist best to bring it into the light

660
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,029
and to regulate it in a in a reasonable

661
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,009
fashion I think that that makes sense to

662
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:28,990
do a rapid fire what is your favorite no

663
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:30,519
I just wanted to say so so going back

664
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:33,339
towards the overconsumption over

665
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:35,139
overproduction and and under

666
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:36,759
availability of retail I know that this

667
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,890
is like let's talk a little bit about

668
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,809
non California things I think that this

669
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,550
is an express aimed by some of the folks

670
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:44,980
up in Oregon with the new revenue

671
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:46,629
coalition I know that they're a couple

672
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,220
years ahead of us and some of their

673
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:51,220
implementation so we might as well learn

674
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,980
from other states and we know very much

675
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,569
that Oregon has over produced quite

676
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,069
unlike quite a lot do their small

677
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:58,960
population size with great growing

678
00:26:57,069 --> 00:27:01,929
conditions Southern Oregon and the new

679
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,090
revenue revenue coalition up there has

680
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:06,370
promoted on on-site consumption lounges

681
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:08,970
and offense as an express way of getting

682
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:12,418
rid of a lot of this not regulated

683
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:15,710
supply in a regulated fashion let's

684
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:24,650
bring back the farmers market

685
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:24,650
