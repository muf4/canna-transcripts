1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
yeah we're running a european-wide say

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:06,419
research called the 4/20 poll we are

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,490
collecting a consumer data and these

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:10,589
data are we gonna use to to convince

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,019
governments to make better regulations

6
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:17,399
better laws which suits the needs of the

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,618
cannabis consumer nice and how you are

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,809
planning to do that like what is your

9
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,039
strategy strategy well we used to do

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,669
this in in the Netherlands we had a

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,529
research done with 9000 people and that

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,420
data has been used to convince the Dutch

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,250
government to finally regulate the

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,989
growing in the Netherlands so I should

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,189
probably know where for 40 years we have

16
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:37,589
the coffee shops in the Netherlands you

17
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,259
can bike you can buy weeds but it was

18
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,629
not allowed to grow and now legislation

19
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,939
is coming through which makes also the

20
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,070
growing possible basis with partly

21
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:49,109
thanks to the data that we have provided

22
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,079
and well there's a lot of things going

23
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,460
on in Europe on the regulation side and

24
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,039
so we are also collecting now as

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,230
throughout Europe the same data to use

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,170
that to convince European governments to

27
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:03,119
to regulate the recreational cannabis

28
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,500
you can fill out the questionnaire at

29
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,500
