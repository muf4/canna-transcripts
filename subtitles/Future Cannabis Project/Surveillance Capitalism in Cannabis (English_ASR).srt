2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,240
so we're in the age of surveillance

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,279
capitalism and the problem with

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:21,210
surveillance capitalism is what it does

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:24,570
is it tries to harvest behaviors and

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,929
data's data that belongs to other people

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,899
whether it's their cannabis genetic

8
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:33,119
sequences or their social behavior on

9
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:36,539
Facebook and what happens is the

10
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:39,000
behavioral surplus or data surplus is

11
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,700
harvested by these companies and turned

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,878
and monetized so my big problem in the

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,120
Philo's affair was my initial and

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,099
ongoing concern that Philo's was saying

15
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:54,828
that they were protecting the craft

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,448
cultivators from predatory patents by

17
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:01,649
creating a database of functions prior

18
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:03,269
art to protect people from patenting

19
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,849
genetics that weren't theirs

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,530
the problem was there was an ulterior

21
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:11,429
motive the ulterior motive was to

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:14,700
aggregate data use that data to find

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,530
markers that could be used to drive a

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,290
breeding program and that's

25
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,450
fundamentally dishonest because what

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,880
it's saying is we're gonna take all the

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,070
data from all your children and use it

28
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,188
to make designer babies that we sell

29
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:31,529
where they're fundamentally competing

30
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:34,679
against the people that they were

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,640
telling they were there to protect and I

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,770
have a real problem with that

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,228
so surveillance capitalism was first

34
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:43,259
popularized relatively recently this

35
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:45,090
idea by this woman who's a former

36
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,640
professor at Harvard Business School

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,320
shosanna Zubov and she wrote this book

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,489
called the age of surveillance

39
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:55,728
capitalism and it's a big thick 800 page

40
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:58,679
really really bad ass book it's

41
00:01:55,728 --> 00:02:01,259
incredibly well argued it's incredibly

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,118
clearly written and it makes this

43
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,978
incredibly damning case that right now

44
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:10,110
harvesting information is big business

45
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:15,419
and people don't even know there

46
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:17,160
being harvested but it's worse than that

47
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,500
when you buy let's say you buy an

48
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,259
internet-connected thermostat for your

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,629
house most people don't read the fine

50
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,459
print of the Terms of Service you're

51
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,289
actually agreeing to share your data

52
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,810
about how you move through your house

53
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:32,939
how you heat your house and basically a

54
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,620
lot of information about your behavior

55
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:39,829
in your house to a thousand different

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,830
companies it's a big difference I mean

57
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:47,429
when you subscribe to a magazine they

58
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,379
would sell your data to the credit card

59
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,950
company or the credit card company would

60
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:54,209
sell your data it's like everybody's

61
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:56,250
gathering other people's data and then

62
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,500
selling it off to other people slicing

63
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,239
dicing and selling it all right and so

64
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,439
the thing is is that it's going to come

65
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,599
to cannabis and you know why it's going

66
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,680
to come to cannabis because

67
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,139
unfortunately the cannabis industry is

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,830
the most naive and they're the most easy

69
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:13,009
to exploit and so whether it's patent

70
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,500
trolling whether it's surveillance

71
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:19,620
capitalism whether it's lying to people

72
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,769
about the efficacy of compounds produced

73
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:26,219
by the cannabis plant so they mistakenly

74
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,620
treat themselves with these things it's

75
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:30,539
really it's it's really kind of a seedy

76
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,489
time in the canvas business and it's

77
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:35,548
time to clean it up it's time for people

78
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,769
to speak out and protect the innocent

79
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:41,180
because the truth is there are a lot of

80
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,180
innocents whether they know it or not

81
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:50,158
perspective well I mean I think the best

82
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:53,128
example right now without question would

83
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:55,798
be five most right but I would have

84
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:57,298
concerns how about if you have an image

85
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,730
how about if you have an

86
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,989
internet-connected app that's

87
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:06,929
controlling your vaporizer so basically

88
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,930
every time you decide to take a hit at

89
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,819
weed it knows how long you draw how long

90
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,849
a draw you took how much was in the

91
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,409
chamber I mean that that's kind of

92
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:17,639
actually kind of a little bit more than

93
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,049
you might want to share you certainly

94
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,780
don't that do that with your alcohol

95
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:24,810
consumption okay and so the thing is is

96
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:28,819
that you have to control that date the

97
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:33,300
key is I don't mind data aggregation

98
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:35,750
what I want is informed exploitation by

99
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,280
the person who's providing the data

100
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,740
about what their data is being used for

101
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,659
and the ability to opt out that's what's

102
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,189
going on and I think there's a lot of

103
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,510
sneaky stuff going on and it will

104
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,918
continue as long as there's an app

105
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,899
connected to anything

106
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:51,000
whether it's you growing the plant

107
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:52,978
whether it's you having the plant tested

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,410
by an analytical lab a genetic lab

109
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:58,649
there's an opportunity to gather data

110
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:01,590
and the best way to suss out whether

111
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:03,629
somebody's legit or not is are they

112
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:05,939
gathering data and not shipping a

113
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,709
product follow us is perfect example

114
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,240
viola sells a ship in a product they

115
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:12,509
were just aggregating data well what we

116
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,639
really gonna use it for and that and so

117
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:16,589
there are certain kind of tests you can

118
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,410
do I mean right now there's you know I

119
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:22,228
can I get a lot of crap about my patent

120
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,090
that I wrote and the thing is is that I

121
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:26,279
would be concerned about my patent if

122
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:28,049
the people who own the patent were not

123
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,638
shipping a product if they're shipping a

124
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,750
product if they're doing what they said

125
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,870
they were going to do when they applied

126
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,310
for the patent which was bring utility

127
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,158
to the marketplace we got a utility

128
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,959
patent and the key with a utility patent

129
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:41,668
is you have to show that you're going to

130
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,049
provide utility the only way you can do

131
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:45,359
that basically is by shipping a product

132
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,120
or a service and if they don't do either

133
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,980
one then their patent trolls so

134
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,689
what's the product or service there

135
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,340
should be well they haven't shipped

136
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:54,000
anything it's what they're doing is

137
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,979
they're trying to do something very

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,040
ambitious and what they're trying to do

139
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,210
is ship homozygous seed so seed that

140
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,830
when they plant it you get the same

141
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:04,620
plant every time if they start doing

142
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:06,810
that which I hope they do and was the

143
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,449
intent then they're not patent trolls

144
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,620
they're they're johnny seeds and that's

145
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,180
what they that's what they wanted to be

146
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:22,470
so let's see if they become that so

147
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:24,930
basically the idea of if somebody wants

148
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:28,370
to plant a consistent soybean crop or

149
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,840
400 conventional AG not not necessarily

150
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,519
predatory at right I'm not a fan of

151
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,019
predatory act but I'm a huge fan I mean

152
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,859
Johnny seeds I mean there's they're kind

153
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:39,538
of an example are Johnny suit says no no

154
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,110
no Johnny seems like that's where you go

155
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:44,909
to get heirloom apples or heirloom

156
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,180
grapes or whatever I mean they they just

157
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:53,300
really they're a very very high quality

158
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:53,300
hippie run egg company in the Northeast

159
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:59,759
you can get a thousand different plants

160
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:01,620
right express themselves and they're

161
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,788
gonna say that that's okay oh no it's

162
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,459
like that's normal

163
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:08,159
fino typical variation know what it is

164
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,529
is Paul and shucking breeding that's not

165
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,960
done like AG doesn't it's done like

166
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,728
underground growers do it I mean there's

167
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,029
a lot of people who are like former

168
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:18,899
moonshiners who now are telling you

169
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:20,609
moonshiners know how to run the liquor

170
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,529
business and that wasn't true back then

171
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,150
and it's not true now underground

172
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,799
breeders are not necessarily gonna drive

173
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:27,359
the future of this and that doesn't have

174
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,400
to be a bad thing it actually could be a

175
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,038
really good thing it's just about intent

176
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,019
and what they do not what they said and

177
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:36,839
the thing is is that we're now we're

178
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:38,189
nearing the age where let's stop

179
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,629
listening to the crowd that comes out of

180
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:42,029
people's mouths about what they're going

181
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,348
to do and how good it's gonna be for us

182
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,438
and start paying attention to what

183
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:46,899
they're actually shit

184
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:49,210
because that will define this industry

185
00:07:46,899 --> 00:08:02,720
not what we say

186
00:07:49,209 --> 00:08:02,719
