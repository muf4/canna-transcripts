16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:38,850
take us away into the appellation world

17
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:40,530
thanks Chris and Thank You Blanc it's a

18
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,629
pleasure to be here welcome to my home

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:48,829
in Napa I've been asked to set the stage

20
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:53,250
for our discussions today by giving you

21
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:55,859
kind of a tour de force of populations

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,988
and geographical indications around the

23
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,539
world and how we get to the point we are

24
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:02,429
today of crafting our cannabis

25
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,409
appellations and what the background to

26
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:09,420
that is so I'm going to divide my

27
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,460
remarks into the following sections if

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,228
you could move the slide to the to the

29
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,629
next one please

30
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:18,329
Chris first I'm going to talk about the

31
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:20,819
road to GIS GIS we're going to be using

32
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:23,908
a lot of acronyms here kiai stands for

33
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:26,279
geographical indications and it started

34
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,140
with the Paris Convention this is an

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,070
international perspective all the way

36
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,509
forward to tricks which is the

37
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:35,879
trade-related aspects of intellectual

38
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,920
property rights it's an agreement as

39
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,158
we'll see that was adopted by the World

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,200
Trade Organization and this will tell us

41
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,590
what Appalachians and geographical

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,060
indications are and the issues that

43
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,689
we've been trying to deal with both

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,439
nationally and internationally then

45
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:56,789
we're going to move roughly equal time

46
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:59,548
segments for each of these sections to

47
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,610
wine Appalachians in both the old world

48
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:05,340
and the new world because really it's

49
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:08,250
well by no means our why is wine the

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,330
only commodity for which Appalachians

51
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,860
apply its prime primarily the the focal

52
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,780
point because it's

53
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,300
such long-standing particularly in the

54
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,280
old world that we have a lot of lessons

55
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,140
to learn and of course we have the

56
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,840
experience in the United States and

57
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,599
other new world countries of our

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,170
American viticultural areas which is the

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,329
third bullet here a BAS and I'm going to

60
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:36,750
tell you basically what the experience

61
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,570
has been with a BAS in our country what

62
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,110
we've learned what we've created what

63
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,759
the regulations say this is an area in

64
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,490
which I've participated actively

65
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:50,579
throughout my career in in actually

66
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,939
forming AV A's in California and

67
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,430
elsewhere I want to spend a little bit

68
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:59,659
of time talking about what I regard is a

69
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,310
very important subject conflicts between

70
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:05,669
Geographic trademarks that is a mark

71
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,189
that includes a geographic term and GIS

72
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:11,399
which primarily are geographic terms

73
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:14,699
sometimes they appear in both both a

74
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,010
geographic mark and in a GI and there

75
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,589
can be conflicts between them I know we

76
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:22,048
have a session later in the webinar on

77
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,689
that specific topic and so all I want to

78
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,900
do is introduce the points and then I'm

79
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:30,509
going to leave time for for Q&amp;A so

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,409
that's the road map let's start section

81
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:36,359
1 the road 2 key is it started in 1883

82
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,549
with the Paris Convention for the

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,989
protection of industrial property this

84
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,209
is an era in which rapid

85
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,209
industrialization was occurring around

86
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:48,060
the world and this is really the first

87
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:50,719
legal agreement that deals with they use

88
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,620
the terms indications of source and

89
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,659
appellations of origin but that

90
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,409
agreement didn't define either of those

91
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:00,959
terms that came in later agreements and

92
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:02,430
you'll see down at the bottom that there

93
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,009
are a hundred and seventy-seven

94
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,349
contracting parties to the Paris

95
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:09,569
Convention including the United States

96
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:14,789
it's a very agreement that that was

97
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:16,048
broadly adopted around the world now the

98
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,839
important thing about the Paris

99
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:22,019
Convention is that it only addressed

100
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:26,519
false indications and not misleading

101
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,250
indications so for example the agreement

102
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,370
at war

103
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,750
did deal with both false and misleading

104
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:37,569
but not with respect to origin so

105
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:41,649
article 10 B of the agreement is the

106
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:44,819
provision that says that not only would

107
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:47,169
it be prohibited to use a false

108
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:50,709
indication of source or appellation of

109
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,930
origin for example if I said on a wine

110
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,469
that it's Napa Valley and in fact the

111
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,180
wine

112
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,860
none of the grapes come from the Napa

113
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:03,040
Valley that's false but it also the

114
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,770
agreement wanted to get at misleading or

115
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,100
deceptive uses of those names and that

116
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:11,289
can take many forms it can take the form

117
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:16,530
of just saying that this is like Napa

118
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:19,060
Valley or similar to or Napa Valley type

119
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:20,949
that would be one indication where it's

120
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:25,418
not really from there and you're you but

121
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:27,279
it could be misleading or variations in

122
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:31,409
spelling so you'll see that the

123
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:33,759
agreement prohibited not only false

124
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,120
indications but also those that were

125
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,349
liable to mislead the public as to the

126
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,189
nature the manufacturing process the

127
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:45,070
characteristics the suitability for

128
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:47,469
purpose or the quantity of the goods

129
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:50,019
interestingly it doesn't say origin

130
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,390
origin was in an earlier draft of the

131
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:55,500
agreement but it was pulled out because

132
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:58,599
there's always been a controversy about

133
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,939
the use of generic terms which we'll

134
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,820
talk about in a minute and other kind of

135
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:06,459
indicators to tell someone that a wine

136
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:08,918
is for example like a Bordeaux even

137
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:12,639
though it's not a Bordeaux wine let's go

138
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:16,959
to the next slide so the next agreement

139
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,509
in this litany is the Lisbon Agreement I

140
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,449
don't know why the heading this is very

141
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:25,089
garbled I'm not exactly look there we go

142
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:27,459
thank you Chris the Lisbon agreement we

143
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:30,399
roll forward all the way to 1958 but

144
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:33,129
it's a very important agreement because

145
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,500
it for the first time defines an

146
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:37,569
appellation of origin and you'll see

147
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,660
that in the first bullet it's a

148
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:44,050
geographical denomination of a country

149
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,360
jayati designating a product originating

150
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,730
marryin and these are the important

151
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,840
words the quality or Karis

152
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:54,670
characteristics of which are due

153
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,739
exclusively or essentially to the

154
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:59,770
geographic environment including natural

155
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,750
and human factors this is the causal

156
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:04,839
link that we talked about between

157
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,389
product in place that that it's not just

158
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:10,899
that a product is manufactured in a

159
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:13,419
place or even that the raw materials

160
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:15,009
come from that place basically the final

161
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,629
product whether it's an agricultural

162
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:21,250
crop a handy handicraft textile whatever

163
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:23,920
it is whatever kind of appellation

164
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,319
system we're talking about the quality

165
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,650
or characteristics of that final product

166
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,930
are tied directly to the geographic

167
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:34,089
environment so in a case of an

168
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,189
agricultural crop that's actually where

169
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:38,709
the crop is grown which we refer to as

170
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:41,170
terroir all of the aspects of the

171
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:44,169
natural environment but it also includes

172
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,670
the human factors and by that I mean how

173
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,500
you farm that land

174
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,750
what is your planning density what's

175
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,269
your route stock what's your what's your

176
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,000
trellis system how do you make the wine

177
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:57,549
in the winery all of those human factors

178
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,470
that result in this final product so

179
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:05,020
finally in 1958 we have a definition of

180
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:08,230
appellation of origin we also have a

181
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:10,029
registry maintained by WIPO the World

182
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:13,060
Intellectual Property Organization in

183
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:16,809
Geneva where you can let the world know

184
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:19,810
that you as a contracting state of the

185
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,519
Lisbon Agreement have recognized an

186
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,199
appellation of words and in your state

187
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,918
and you'd like the all the other

188
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,469
contracting States to abide by it and so

189
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:32,649
they are given notice by WIPO and within

190
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:35,349
a year they they have the right to

191
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:39,250
refuse protection but they have to state

192
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:42,879
why and and those can be that for

193
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,730
example that a wine name was you in use

194
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,830
in that country for a very long time

195
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,839
without having an indication of without

196
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,820
being an indication of origin so there

197
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,640
was a pre-existing use of that name

198
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,490
there are other reasons why a name

199
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:01,149
maybe refuse to protection interestingly

200
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:05,340
the Lisbon agreement covers not only

201
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:08,919
false uses but also any usurpation or

202
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:11,769
imitation even when used in translation

203
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:16,479
or accompanied by words such as kind

204
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:19,179
type or light and once it's a name is

205
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,100
protected it cannot fall into genera

206
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:23,289
side it cannot become a generic name

207
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,680
once it's protected in this in the

208
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:29,469
contracting state so this goes much much

209
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:31,889
farther than the Paris Convention in

210
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,910
protecting against false indications

211
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:37,179
protecting against misleading

212
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:39,549
indications and also defining in a very

213
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:42,309
direct way the link between the product

214
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:44,229
and place in order to qualify as an

215
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:46,239
appellation of origin now the downside

216
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:49,060
Chris if you go to the next slide is

217
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,500
that there were very few contracting

218
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:53,289
parties and you'll see that they were

219
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:57,759
mostly in Europe they're in Canada the

220
00:09:53,289 --> 00:10:04,809
United States etc Australia they did not

221
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:07,539
join even when there was a an amendment

222
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:10,539
to the Lisbon Agreement which took place

223
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:13,000
in 2015 the Geneva act because the

224
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:16,360
Lisbon Agreement was seeking and white

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,929
but was seeking to make the this this

226
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,570
treaty this Agreement more widespread so

227
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:30,370
that they amended it in 2015 to cover

228
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:32,560
not only Appalachians work good reason

229
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:36,370
to turn off your cell phone sorry about

230
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,559
that um also they cover the registration

231
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:42,480
of GIS which is the agreement that we're

232
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:44,739
going to turn to next next slide please

233
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,230
okay so this is the World Trade

234
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,090
Organization agreement on trade-related

235
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,840
aspects of intellectual property rights

236
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:54,190
trips agreement 1995 and for the first

237
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,370
time we have a definition of

238
00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:00,130
geographical indication a GI but what

239
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:04,029
you're going to see here is that GIS are

240
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:05,710
a more liberal a looser definition than

241
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,959
an appellation of origin or to put it

242
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:12,040
another way appellations of origin

243
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:14,129
are a subset of GIS a GI according to

244
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:17,349
article 22 of the TRIPS Agreement

245
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:19,149
identifies a good as originating in the

246
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,850
territory of a member or region or a

247
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:24,059
locality that's identical to the

248
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,580
appellation of origin definition so far

249
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:31,000
except for the bold-faced language where

250
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,550
a given quality reputation for the first

251
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,169
time we see the word reputation or other

252
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:38,889
characteristics of the good is

253
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:41,799
essentially not exclusively essentially

254
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:44,830
attributable to its geographical origin

255
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:47,049
there are 164 member states that signed

256
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,820
this agreement including the United

257
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:53,379
States so it like the Paris Convention

258
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:57,430
its widespread approval around the world

259
00:11:53,379 --> 00:12:00,519
and in fact in article 23 there is a

260
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:03,278
protection that is more elevated than

261
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:06,159
for any other goods and services for

262
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:09,338
wines and spirits specifically like the

263
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:12,159
Lisbon Agreement the the GIS are

264
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:14,620
protected against false and misleading

265
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,319
deceptive uses whereas all the other

266
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,990
goods that are GIS that are wines and

267
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,360
spirits are not protected against

268
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:25,500
misleading and deceptive uses but only

269
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:29,440
false uses so this is important

270
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:31,539
article 24 contains exceptions we have

271
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,760
exceptions for Geographic trademarks

272
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:36,458
which we'll talk about later for generic

273
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:39,129
names where a name has been used in a

274
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:41,379
country for a very long time for example

275
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:44,320
a lot of the cheese's in America like

276
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:48,100
feta and parmesan that really don't come

277
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,528
from their original sources what's

278
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,930
important to know about the troops

279
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:55,208
agreement is it's a minimum standards

280
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:57,789
agreement meaning that member states

281
00:12:55,208 --> 00:13:02,739
have the right to put in place stricter

282
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:05,559
rules governing GIS some have their own

283
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,720
GI systems we call those soui generous

284
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:11,649
systems others as we'll see in the next

285
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,019
slide will use their trademark laws to

286
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:17,970
recognize key is the last point about

287
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:20,350
the troops agreement is that there is no

288
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,680
multilateral register where you can look

289
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,600
to WHO as you can

290
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,599
WIPO for the lisbon agreement and see

291
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,019
the list of GIS around the world next

292
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,939
slide please

293
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:33,499
here are examples photographic examples

294
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:37,429
if you click one more time Chris I think

295
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:39,769
some more will come up names that you

296
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:42,698
all know Parmesan cheese from Gianna

297
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:45,799
Reggiano and its translation to parmesan

298
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:48,019
Darjeeling tea Parma ham Indian River

299
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,969
navel oranges from where I'm from in

300
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:52,188
Napa cone of coffee which is a story

301
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:56,769
unto itself and even things like

302
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:58,969
traditional knowledge on the bottom left

303
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:03,428
ayurvedic

304
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,428
in in india let's go to the next slide i

305
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:10,188
was mentioning the u.s. protects gi's

306
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:12,678
through the existing trademark laws and

307
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:16,368
does not have a soui generous GI system

308
00:14:12,678 --> 00:14:19,220
as the as occurs in the European Union

309
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:20,720
and other countries we use certification

310
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,730
and collective marks and I've just

311
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,278
listed some of the certification marks

312
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,920
and the registration numbers in the US

313
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,808
to give you an indication of this Parma

Georgia parmigiano-reggiano and wrote

317
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,849
for and here I give the definition if

318
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,999
you were to look this up on the PTO

319
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,639
Patent and Trademark Office a site you'd

320
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:48,649
see that wrote for is a cheese it's have

321
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,778
been manufactured from sheep's milk

322
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:52,490
cured in the caves of the community of

323
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:54,740
Roquefort in accordance with

324
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:58,039
long-established methods and prophecies

325
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:01,068
these methods and processes are the

326
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:03,169
natural are the human factors that go

327
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:06,048
along with the fact that the sheep's

328
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:09,588
milk and the caves are inside of the

329
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:11,899
area of the Rope for Appalachian and and

330
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:15,139
these are protected in the US as a

331
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:17,120
certification mark okay what are the

332
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:20,058
differences then between GIS and

333
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,889
appellations of origin just in summary g

334
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:24,169
eyes require a link between the quality

335
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:26,499
other characteristics or reputation of

336
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:28,519
the product and its place of origin

337
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:31,670
appellations of origin require a

338
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:34,068
stricter link namely that the products

339
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:35,309
quality or characteristics are due

340
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:37,229
exclusively or

341
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:40,319
essentially to the products geographical

342
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:43,289
origin this means that the usually means

343
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,870
doesn't every country will set up their

344
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:47,549
own rules but typically it means that

345
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,830
the raw materials are sourced in the

346
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:52,769
place of origin and that the processing

347
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:56,009
of the product takes place there now on

348
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:57,509
the bottom of this slide are the seals I

349
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:01,379
mean we're going to talk about seals I

350
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:04,919
think in the next session for the PDO s

351
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:08,309
which are the of the appellations of

352
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,769
origin for the PGI's which are the GIS

353
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:12,809
the geographical indications and then

354
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,909
they often also have traditional

355
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:16,649
specialty products these are the three

356
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:18,959
seals that are used in the European

357
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:21,209
Union to differentiate that is the

358
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,460
European Union doesn't just pick one

359
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:25,050
it's not just that every product in the

360
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,680
European Union is an appellation of

361
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:28,278
origin

362
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,899
some are PGI's and some are traditional

363
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,549
specialties so you don't have to choose

364
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:39,480
one or the other

365
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:41,509
next slide Chris yeah thank you one

366
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,210
important thing to note about

367
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:47,429
appellations of origin and G is any G I

368
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,420
will call appellations of origin a

369
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:53,009
subset of G is is it there is an ongoing

370
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:57,269
tension between tradition and innovation

371
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:58,950
in these TI products you know an

372
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:00,360
appellation of origin for a product

373
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:04,078
that's been around for a very long time

374
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:08,099
has history and tradition to encapsulate

375
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:11,188
in the production methodology and all

376
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:13,169
the well what we call in our cannabis

377
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:16,650
appellation regulation standards

378
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:19,259
practices and cultivars and and so there

379
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:22,110
is tradition to respect but there's also

380
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:25,230
innovation that's important for any GI

381
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:28,619
because a GI can die and there are lots

382
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,720
of examples of deceased GIS because they

383
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:35,549
didn't keep up with the times methods

384
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:39,329
the consumer demands so we find tension

385
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:40,980
I gave two examples here below we won't

386
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:43,829
spend any time on them because I'm going

387
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,559
to move quickly but mustard Damascus och

388
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:48,899
in the Languedoc region of France and

389
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,419
teeny yellow which is an Anton or

390
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:55,740
one of the most famous Super Tuscans

391
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:58,230
both of these lines and their wine

392
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,599
proprietors were innovators and they

393
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,960
didn't like being bound by the

394
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:06,539
appellation of origin controls and in

395
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,970
order to innovate they literally had to

396
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:11,940
sell their wines as table wines and they

397
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:15,720
broke out of the alo system in fact it

398
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:18,000
was the AOC and the DOCG systems in

399
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,549
their respective countries in order to

400
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,799
do their own thing to try to show that

401
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:25,319
their innovation would make a better

402
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,629
product a higher quality with even

403
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,099
better characteristics more recognizable

404
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,550
and distinctive characteristics

405
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:36,000
interestingly they were both successful

406
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:38,009
and what happens is then the appellation

407
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,890
authorities recognize that and change

408
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:44,069
the rules so this is not a static

409
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,490
process it's a dynamic process next

410
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,490
slide please

411
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:55,269
okay let's turn to wine now and if you

412
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:57,799
click through all of these bullets Chris

413
00:18:55,269 --> 00:19:01,549
you'll see the bottom one is to piss a

414
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:03,409
day and you'll know you're done I wanted

415
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:05,359
to start with the controlled

416
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,820
appellations of the old world this is

417
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:11,299
the a Palacio Dora gain control a

418
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:14,659
meaning control or do-si-do Romo nazione

419
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:16,129
Dora Jean control Otto controlled what

420
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,320
does it mean to be a controlled

421
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:22,280
appellation what it really means is that

422
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:24,619
you are in essence a an appellation of

423
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:27,889
origin and not a GI because you are

424
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:30,709
doing your getting into the issues of

425
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:34,160
standards practices and and cultivars in

426
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:36,319
a way that typically a GI does not so in

427
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,880
the old world and I show the example of

428
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:44,210
La tache which is one of the most famous

429
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:46,280
Burgundy wines and it's an AOC you the

430
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,920
Great's have to be totally grown within

431
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,139
the appellation only permissible grape

432
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,460
varietals can be grown you can grow

433
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,680
anything you want

434
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,079
in that area but you just can't use the

435
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,210
AOC you can't call yourself Latasha if

436
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:00,679
you're not using Pinot Noir grapes if

437
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,259
you want to grow Cabernet there you'll

438
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,650
be a a rebel and you can sell your wine

439
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:14,390
as a table wine and then there are a

440
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:16,940
host of other criteria both in farming

441
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,430
and in winemaking that you need to

442
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,350
follow I've given some examples here the

443
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,420
yield of grapes minimum and maximum

444
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:25,849
alcohol percentage but it's actually

445
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,890
much broader than that this is called a

446
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,990
Calle de Chartres is what the French

447
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:34,009
call it and it's really your it's not a

448
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:35,960
recipe it's a range of parameters so

449
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:38,720
that you can still as a wine proprietor

450
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,759
practice your artistry and produce a

451
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,440
unique product but you have to stay

452
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:45,529
within these given ranges and then

453
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,720
ultimately you have to pass a chemical

454
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:49,940
analysis and a to piss 'ti tests

455
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,519
literally where a judge taste the

456
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,850
product and says is this typical of a

457
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:58,639
latosha wine given all the vintage

458
00:20:55,849 --> 00:21:00,529
variations and everything else that can

459
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,830
cause variation

460
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:06,289
but if it's not typical then it can be

461
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:12,409
thrown out and it's not allowed to use

462
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:16,519
the AOC on the label next in the United

463
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:18,710
States we didn't really have much of a

464
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:22,190
concept of provenance coming out of the

465
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,630
ashes of prohibition in 1933 and trying

466
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,100
to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps

467
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:30,230
largely through innovation and technical

468
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:34,730
expertise it really wasn't until the

469
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:36,950
paris tasting of 1976 when some actually

470
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:39,470
Napa Valley wines bested the wines of

471
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:43,460
France that people started to use on a

472
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:45,559
more routine basis geographical

473
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,059
indications appellations of origin on

474
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:49,159
their label but nobody knew where they

475
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:51,859
were they weren't regulated so here are

476
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,259
two examples of Louis martini California

477
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:56,089
Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon I'm sure you

478
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:58,670
all know where California Mountain is

479
00:21:56,089 --> 00:22:01,250
well it's wherever you think it is

480
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,470
there's no such thing and Northern

481
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,539
California well all of us Californians

482
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,640
can tell you we where there is no real

483
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:10,609
definition of Northern California and

484
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,430
people have their own views as a result

485
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:16,729
if you go to the next slide Chris we

486
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:19,340
ended up adopting a system an

487
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:22,819
appellation system in the late 70s it

488
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:26,089
took effect in 1983 where we have for

489
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:29,289
our Appalachians for wine you can use

490
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:31,759
the United States a state or a county

491
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:33,680
those are political Appalachians of

492
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,599
course those boundaries pre-existed we

493
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,850
all know where they are but the new

494
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,219
invention was this concept of an

495
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:43,159
appellation or an American video trail

496
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,980
area in a VA that would going to be

497
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,420
created and established by the federal

498
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,430
government this is not at the state

499
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:54,380
level it's the Treasury Department and

500
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:56,029
the tax and trade Bureau alcohol and

501
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,880
tobacco tax and trade Bureau that does

502
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:04,279
that runs this program but a DA's would

503
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,780
be created anew and in for each of these

504
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,639
Appalachians because American

505
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:10,240
viticultural areas are a form of

506
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,230
Appalachian under the American system

507
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,240
you would have to have a certain

508
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:18,410
percentage of your grapes from

509
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:21,650
area in the end the wine but it did not

510
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:25,250
control and it does not control which

511
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:28,070
variety of grapes you use your yields

512
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:32,779
your farming methods your winemaking

513
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:35,210
practices only where the grapes come

514
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:37,759
from and where the wine is made so if

515
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,100
you use in a VA on the label the wine

516
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:44,089
must be made in the state in which the a

517
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:46,519
VA is located that's important and in

518
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:48,230
order to form in a VA well you let's go

519
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:51,079
to the next slide we'll get into how you

520
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:54,079
form an a VA in a minute here's the

521
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:56,629
definition defined as a delimited great

522
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:59,480
growing region distinguishable by

523
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,250
geographic features interestingly those

524
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,920
are the same words that we find in our

525
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,480
proposed cannabis regulations the

526
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,820
boundaries of which have been recognized

527
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,370
and defined by TTB here are two examples

528
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:13,250
down below the Ohio River Valley on the

529
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:16,039
right finger lakes in New York on the

530
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,859
left appearing on the label in direct

531
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:21,859
conjunction with the grape varietal the

532
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:23,990
VOA and ruse on on the right and the

533
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:28,909
pinot noir on the left let's go to the

534
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:32,690
next slide so just two and one more

535
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:34,759
click please just to show you examples

536
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,759
let's take the hug off and label that's

537
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:40,460
a Napa Valley wine the fact that it says

538
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,339
Napa Valley means that 85 percent of the

539
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,110
grapes are grown in the Napa Valley the

540
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:47,240
fact that there's a vineyard designation

541
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:49,849
Heston vineyard increases that

542
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,859
percentage to 95 and in fact there's

543
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:54,769
even more information on the label which

544
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:56,750
you're allowed to use the L block of

545
00:24:54,769 --> 00:25:02,779
that particular vineyard for example

546
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:06,170
next slide so far we have formed 245 80

547
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:10,160
A's in the 32 states of the United

548
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:11,808
States I'm you're not supposed to read

549
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,250
the whole that small type but this is

550
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:20,660
right out of the of the Code of Federal

551
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:24,500
Regulations go to the next slide here is

552
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:27,920
how you form an ABA first you must show

553
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:31,460
and this is anyone can do this it could

554
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,500
one person it could be someone who's not

555
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,259
in the wine industry at all doesn't grow

556
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:40,759
grapes and doesn't make wine anyone can

557
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:42,920
file a navy a petition with TTB whoever

558
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:44,569
files that petition whether it usually

559
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,000
it's a group of vintners and growers

560
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:51,279
together filing it

561
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,589
you must adduce name evidence that

562
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,180
currently and directly associates the

563
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:58,220
name with the area in which you

564
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,830
viticultural exists so there has to be

565
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,140
some great growing there all of the area

566
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:05,869
within the boundaries must be nationally

567
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,910
or locally known by the name specified

568
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:10,099
in the petition although the use of that

569
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:12,140
name may extend beyond the proposed a VA

570
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:14,389
boundary so you can have names that are

571
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,600
over inclusive you can't have names that

572
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:20,000
are under inclusive and they must

573
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:22,519
remember this is all done all of these

574
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,079
regulations for wine in the United

575
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,359
States are under the federal alcohol

576
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,579
administration Act which is in part a

577
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:31,309
consumer protection of consumer

578
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:33,589
information act and this is to give the

579
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:36,259
consumer information to guide their

580
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:38,959
purchasing decisions there's boundaries

581
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:41,390
obviously and they tell you if you'll

582
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,660
see down in four below those are based

583
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:46,759
on characteristics seen on United States

584
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,790
Geological Survey maps those are topo

585
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:52,700
graphic maps so most boundaries are done

586
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:56,230
based on elevation contours that show on

587
00:26:52,700 --> 00:27:01,789
those maps rivers and roads mountaintops

588
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:04,490
and the light not like in France where

589
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:07,099
we actually use parcel lines the lines

590
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:09,859
of your property to define an

591
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:12,549
appellation and then the most important

592
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:14,949
point in my from my perspective is

593
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:18,109
distinguishing viticultural features

594
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:20,690
climate soil geology physical features

595
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:23,509
in elevation the petition must explain

596
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:26,029
with pet specificity in what way these

597
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:28,009
features affect viticulture and how they

598
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:30,379
are distinguished viticulture Lee from

599
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:32,869
features associated with adjacent areas

600
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:37,670
outside the boundary it's so funny many

601
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:38,778
of these criteria reappear in our

602
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:41,580
proposed

603
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:43,680
Cannabis Appalachian regulations next

604
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:46,809
line

605
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:50,789
we have had over the course of what is

606
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:56,279
from 1983 to today so that's 37 years

607
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:58,599
we've had the process of actually

608
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:01,509
subdividing Appalachians

609
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:04,029
we call them nested abs or sub a bas

610
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:06,309
where for example on the left there

611
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:10,180
you'll see that Napa Valley in that

612
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:14,230
lighter tan tone has been subdivided

613
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:18,610
into many other smaller area a VA s that

614
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:20,500
capture more distinctive geographical

615
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:22,959
features more distinctive grape growing

616
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,640
environments within the Napa Valley

617
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,500
similarly it's happened in the

618
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,980
Willamette Valley as you see on the

619
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,829
right and Lodi and past Robles and many

620
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,680
other places this is around the world a

621
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:38,589
very common thing whether it's coffee or

622
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,769
tea or whatever the commodity is to to

623
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:43,449
have nested a VA s larger down to

624
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:46,119
smaller and then the consumer can play

625
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:48,160
the I call it the appellation name name

626
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:50,139
game if I want to know about Napa Valley

627
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,150
that's one thing I want to spend more

628
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,790
money because it usually is more money

629
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:57,759
and buy a house out and wine and explore

630
00:28:54,789 --> 00:29:00,279
those differences I can do that so it's

631
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,740
a way of understanding for the consumer

632
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:07,269
better understanding the final product

633
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:09,490
okay next thanks Chris yes well this

634
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:11,740
point is just to reiterate what I said

635
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,809
certain Appalachians command higher

636
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,059
prices this is important this is the

637
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:18,789
value add that comes through an

638
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:21,789
appellation that isn't the the owned by

639
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:24,339
one individual farmer or winery it's a

640
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:27,069
collective of growers and vendors inside

641
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:29,559
the appellation that collectively owned

642
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:32,200
this property and in fact when you put

643
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:34,559
Napa Valley on a wine compared to its

644
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,720
California wine you're gonna spend

645
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:41,470
$19.80 more on average according to this

646
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,930
was a UC Davis AG extension a study and

647
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:47,039
if you go and use Oakville or how amount

648
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:49,299
and you'll be $40 plus more than that

649
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,639
California wine so you're paying more

650
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:53,769
and the question I always ask in the

651
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,020
classes I teach is this is why we do

652
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:58,879
tastings is it worth it is it worth

653
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:01,549
to pay more for that how a mountain wine

654
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,590
than a California wine well only you the

655
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,509
consumer will know and hopefully the

656
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:07,309
producer is producing something that has

657
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:10,309
to go back to the definition of

658
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:12,759
Appalachians that has characteristics

659
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:15,769
and qualities that you can find and

660
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:19,190
refined the next time you buy that wine

661
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:22,720
and help guide your education and

662
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,720
purchases next slide

663
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:29,839
well quality in fact is not a criteria

664
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:31,849
of the a VA system because we don't have

665
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:35,689
the standards practices and cultivars

666
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:38,329
that are that are required to use an

667
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:42,049
appellation name it's much more leaving

668
00:30:38,329 --> 00:30:44,119
it to the collective to experiment it's

669
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:47,389
it's part of the American pride and

670
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:49,099
innovation rather than what we don't

671
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,259
have as long of a tradition particularly

672
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:54,019
the traditions we had were interrupted

673
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:57,440
by 13 years of prohibition nevertheless

674
00:30:54,019 --> 00:31:00,019
the successful Appalachians of which I

675
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:05,450
would certainly include the Napa Valley

676
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:08,210
as one if not the foremost um will do

677
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:11,120
their own efforts at consumer education

678
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:13,400
they'll do the research they'll do the

679
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,229
promotion they'll be interested in

680
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:18,230
sustainability whether it's social

681
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:23,210
environmental or economic and and this

682
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:25,250
is important to their having loyal

683
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:28,519
customers so even though it may not be

684
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:32,359
regulatory it is aspirational and

685
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:34,099
voluntary and and now a a real effort on

686
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:38,929
the part of a VA s that want to succeed

687
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:42,079
in the marketplace next slide here are

688
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:44,390
two examples Cora Mendocino and lowdown

689
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,279
rules each of which take the form of a

690
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,280
logo these are certification marks by

691
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:52,700
the way these are not they are AOC style

692
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,470
controls but on a label they you will

693
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,090
still find Lodi and you'll find

694
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,950
Mendocino on the label is the

695
00:31:56,089 --> 00:32:04,129
appellation but you'll find this logo

696
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:07,370
that tells you what additional grape

697
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:10,160
growing or winemaking rules that they

698
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:12,139
have voluntarily adhered to you know

699
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,269
to put this sticker on the label so

700
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,330
again going back to this tradition and

701
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:20,000
innovation this is the ABA s that don't

702
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:23,119
have the tradition seeking to have more

703
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,160
a OC style controls wanting to honor the

704
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,679
traditions that are now being

705
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:32,210
established in those areas next slide

706
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:33,230
okay we're just going to take a few more

707
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,880
minutes and then we're going to leave

708
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,849
ourselves open for questions I'm going

709
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,470
to keep us on a tight time line but I

710
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:41,599
want to talk for a minute about the

711
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,870
conflicts between Geographic marks and

712
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:47,899
GIS this would be an example of where

713
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:49,909
somebody comes into an area and they

714
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,730
pick the name of their town or of a

715
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:53,960
creek nearby and they may be unwitting

716
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,370
that's the only they don't want to use

717
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,390
their family name and they call their

718
00:32:55,369 --> 00:33:02,989
brand by a geographic name and then

719
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:05,890
later or maybe it's even before the

720
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,940
appellation was established whether the

721
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:11,060
appellation was established before the

722
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:13,549
trademark or after can be is important

723
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:15,649
as the third bullet there shows first in

724
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:18,769
time first and right which is a common

725
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,960
trademark principle but just as

726
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:23,569
important and number one for me is the

727
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,059
fact that nobody owns exclusively a

728
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:28,519
geographic name nobody owns the Napa

729
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:30,559
Valley nobody owns the name Humboldt you

730
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:32,629
may use it and you have to use it

731
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,259
descriptively and that's called a fair

732
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,050
use

733
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:38,779
anyone can say I live in the Napa Valley

734
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:42,889
I live in Humboldt County I live in the

735
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:45,349
Mottola Val um you don't want people to

736
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,580
be mislead this is I think and then this

737
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:47,539
goes back all the way to where we

738
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:49,189
started with these international

739
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:51,799
agreements you know you don't want

740
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:56,990
people to be misled or deceived so if a

741
00:33:51,799 --> 00:34:00,440
geographic mark just make it up you know

742
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:04,400
um well use it in in in the in the

743
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,559
cannabis world Matt ol brand is put on

744
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,619
products that do not come from Atoll

745
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,949
Valley whether the Mottola Valley is is

746
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:18,319
is recognized prior to that or after

747
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:19,699
that it misleads consumers as I said

748
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,370
with respect to the third bullet

749
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:23,239
typically a most intellectual property

750
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:25,519
lawyer

751
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:28,398
would say that this should be resolved

752
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,289
in who registers first if the trademark

753
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,329
pre-existed the appellation well they

754
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:34,639
get to continue I'm not a believer in

755
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:37,608
that I think it's much more complicated

756
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,159
than this and I believe in the rights of

757
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:41,799
Appalachians I think it's a collective

758
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,260
right and it's an important one

759
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:49,580
sometimes the priority is legislated as

760
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:52,490
it is in the EU which is much more much

761
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:55,668
more akin to my views of giving priority

762
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:58,879
to the Appalachian sometimes it turns on

763
00:34:55,668 --> 00:35:00,710
good or bad faith and I've got great

764
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,599
stories here that I'm not able to tell

765
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,858
you because I don't have the time but

766
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:05,779
let's go to the next slide

767
00:35:03,858 --> 00:35:10,630
Chris because I think this will set the

768
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:13,040
stage perhaps for the later session on

769
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:15,800
intellectual property rights these are

770
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:19,750
the kinds of things that should be taken

771
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,850
into consideration in determining how to

772
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:25,280
resolve differences between trademarks

773
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:28,400
and GIS and by trademarks I mean

774
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,320
trademarks that include gie names the

775
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,800
reputation of the region the reputation

776
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,410
of the mark the length of time that the

777
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,320
either the trademark or the region has

778
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:41,269
that name has been out in the public the

779
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,760
extent to which the reputation of the

780
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:46,608
trademark assisted in the development of

781
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,520
the reputation of the region and vice

782
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:52,309
versa the value of the trademark and

783
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:55,159
whether the the trademark holder is

784
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:58,130
likely to be prejudiced or with the

785
00:35:55,159 --> 00:36:01,190
appellation holder be prejudiced if one

786
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:04,210
is given priority over the other and you

787
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:10,070
know from the proposed regulations that

788
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:13,460
CDFA has proposed a a three-year

789
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:17,690
sunsetting period for anyone who has a

790
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:20,059
trademark incorporating the name of a GI

791
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,769
you have would have three years to

792
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:25,309
continue to use it after which you'd

793
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:27,710
have to discontinue pick a new brand

794
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:30,559
name unless and this is an important

795
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:33,130
exception unless your wine or your

796
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,869
cannabis or whatever the product is is

797
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,660
descriptive and does qualify for the

798
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:39,090
appellation of

799
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:41,250
to name so no one is putting a trademark

800
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:44,130
folder out of business they're just

801
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:46,260
saying you must use that name maybe it's

802
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,960
after three years after a sunset period

803
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:51,930
you must use it descriptively and

804
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,309
accurately the last thing I'll say about

805
00:36:51,929 --> 00:36:55,109
this and then we'll open it up to

806
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:58,619
questions is that we are at the

807
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:00,990
beginning of the Appalachian Program for

808
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,369
cannabis this is what excites me so much

809
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:04,859
about it that was at the beginning of

810
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:07,589
the of the American wine appellation

811
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:11,130
system - it's an exciting time we have

812
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:13,829
the chance to minimize right now the

813
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:16,829
number of conflicts between Geographic

814
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:19,949
trademarks and Appalachians for example

815
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:22,590
I would say anybody who after the

816
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:25,079
proposed regulations were more made

817
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:28,550
public who goes out and registers a

818
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:31,759
geographic name that later becomes a GI

819
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:34,320
they should not get the benefit of

820
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,960
grandfathering they're on notice that we

821
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,670
will have a geographical indication

822
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,880
system or an appellation of origin

823
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:44,430
system for cannabis in California so use

824
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,769
geographic names at your at your

825
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:48,589
discretion but also at your potential

826
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:52,619
peril if they later become an

827
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:55,350
appellation so with that I think I've

828
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:59,400
kept - my time and I'd love to answer

829
00:37:55,349 --> 00:38:01,949
any questions that you have thank you so

830
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,889
much that was a wealth of knowledge and

831
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:07,649
I have to admit that I have been flooded

832
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:09,690
with text messages telling us how how

833
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:12,630
valuable this has been so far so I

834
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:14,010
really really appreciate that there's so

835
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,840
much information there it's almost hard

836
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,490
to come up with sort of cohesive

837
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:20,730
questions but one of the things that you

838
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:22,139
really hit on was the purpose of the

839
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,760
Appalachians from the consumer

840
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:26,339
perspective is to be able to experiment

841
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,260
to be able to find and refine certain

842
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:30,289
qualities of a product that you like

843
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,380
that you want to continue to experience

844
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:36,619
in the US you mentioned that the Avs are

845
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:39,420
primarily geographical whereas in the EU

846
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:42,029
they sort of take into everything into

847
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:45,210
account right they take in the soil the

848
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:47,760
the farming practices or the human the

849
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:50,460
human aspect of that when you're talking

850
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:57,359
about the ability to communicate - it

851
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:59,760
consumer sort of the region how helpful

852
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,259
is it to sort of include more of those

853
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,000
factors rather than less like the u.s.

854
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,230
system it seems like that just having

855
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,829
the geographical indicators the bare

856
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,809
minimum

857
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:08,608
how much more utility is there an

858
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:10,289
appellation system that has those higher

859
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:11,579
identifiers z' that we saw in sort of

860
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:13,619
like those Lodi brands that you brought

861
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:18,420
up or the other ones there well I think

862
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:21,390
the answer to that Chris is in part will

863
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,300
a consumer once they know what an

864
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:25,980
appellation product is will it help them

865
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,260
will they be willing to pay that extra

866
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,838
price will they would be willing to say

867
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:33,450
now I know what a Mottola Valley

868
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:35,279
cannabis is like you know I know it's

869
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:37,559
these cultivars that's grown with these

870
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,599
standards and practices I can rest

871
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,608
assured when I buy the next one even if

872
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,280
it's somebody some other cultivator I'm

873
00:39:41,608 --> 00:39:46,889
gonna find again those things that is

874
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:51,660
what will allow that customer to pay the

875
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:54,539
additional dollars to invest in that

876
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:57,690
region now even in with a Vaz v'n though

877
00:39:54,539 --> 00:40:00,539
we don't have that by legislation the AV

878
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:02,970
ASR doing it themselves the vendor

879
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:05,029
grower groups inside the ABA s are

880
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:08,009
seeking to bring that value add

881
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:11,220
proposition that education that

882
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:14,070
guarantee of certain characteristics or

883
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:15,750
qualities to the consumers and they're

884
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,000
doing it through privatization through

885
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:20,880
voluntary certification marks and the

886
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,829
like so in the sense gif and

887
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,130
Appalachians end up you know it's a

888
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:28,619
dynamic they go back and forth

889
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:32,670
ultimately you're trying to have loyal

890
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:33,990
consumers absolutely and speaking of

891
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,550
that sort of consumer question this is

892
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:37,709
actually a question from Rebecca Steen

893
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,300
white who's running our business of

894
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:42,329
Appalachians panel a little bit further

895
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,490
down the road she's wondering you know

896
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:46,619
is this a chicken or the egg problem is

897
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:48,509
the sort of that that consumer

898
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:51,230
investment and a particular reason what

899
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:53,550
drives an Appalachian or is the

900
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,420
Appalachian itself and the producers

901
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,070
that are coming up with these

902
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,539
Appalachian what drives sort of that

903
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:59,430
consumer interest do you have a feeling

904
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:01,469
about that well it's both but it's the

905
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:03,118
producers first and foremost they're the

906
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:04,299
ones who are going to pay for this to go

907
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,769
through this process

908
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,050
they're the ones who know their product

909
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:10,539
best there are the ones will know what

910
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:13,030
the collective I mean they're they're

911
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:14,739
going to be the ones who collaborate on

912
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:18,400
all the information that goes into a

913
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:20,559
petition and and they want to express

914
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,349
this to their consumer so I think it's

915
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:26,199
the the the not just the onus of the

916
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:28,989
responsibility the desire really comes

917
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:31,299
first and foremost in my estimation my

918
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:34,119
experience from the producers but the

919
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:37,870
consumers you know they're at the bottom

920
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:40,539
they're the they're the final test this

921
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:42,429
is why in my class we taste every

922
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:45,039
product if you if you can't see the

923
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:47,769
difference if an Appalachians

924
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,029
standards practices and and cultivars

925
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:52,360
and everything that goes in it is

926
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:57,430
meaningless then your appellation will

927
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:58,300
die on the vine sure yeah if it if it

928
00:41:57,429 --> 00:42:00,069
doesn't have those characteristics

929
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,570
they're recognizable for the rest of us

930
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:04,390
then then what good is it in the first

931
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:06,880
place I guess is the question thank you

932
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:09,730
so much Richard we are unfortunately out

933
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,039
of time for this first very very

934
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:15,750
introductory presentation there is so

935
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:15,750
much there and four on our next camels
