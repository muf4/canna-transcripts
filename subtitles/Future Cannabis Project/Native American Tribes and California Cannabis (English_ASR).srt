here thank you very much thank you I

32
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:05,099
want to talk a little bit about why

33
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,159
we're discussing Native American

34
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:11,069
cannabis in the regulations as they

35
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,919
stand it is required that tribes

36
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:16,709
renounce sovereignty to be a part of our

37
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:20,099
legal cannabis industry now if you're

38
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:22,289
aware of history in any sense you might

39
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:25,229
feel a sentiment that that is a

40
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:26,909
disrespectful request like a song or she

41
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,139
is very important for all of us and

42
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,870
especially tribes

43
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:33,879
when I first saw this in the regulations

44
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,860
I was very much dismayed

45
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:37,719
I spoke with everybody here and

46
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,060
mentioned that in writing a press

47
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:42,099
release for our panel this evening

48
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,349
I started look through some of the

49
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:47,530
issues that I've been following for a

50
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:50,680
few years now jurisdiction is a major

51
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:53,890
issue in addressing how we will

52
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,439
facilitate operations for cannabis with

53
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:59,289
tribes outside of the state regulatory

54
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:03,189
authority and that's a difficult nuance

55
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:06,549
there's also public law 280 which talks

56
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:09,939
about again who manages jurisdiction in

57
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:12,450
terms of federal law local law tribal

58
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:15,340
law there are very complicated issues

59
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:16,509
but in the very simple context we're

60
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,729
going to present to you this evening

61
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:20,829
that you have a vested interest in

62
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:23,459
supporting Native American cannabis and

63
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:27,340
tribes as being a part of this industry

64
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:31,420
potentially cultivating doing lab

65
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:34,539
testing distribution to our licensed

66
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:37,629
retailers and there are opportunities

67
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:39,250
for revenue for the state we're also

68
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:43,180
going to talk about what the

69
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:46,449
possibilities are for legislation y89 24

70
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,330
didn't work and what kind of solutions

71
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:52,929
we can put in place how we can affect

72
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,940
policy to make changes for the future so

73
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,370
with that I'm going to start just by

74
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:00,460
asking our panelists if you all would

75
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,969
each speak to the this point how how do

76
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:06,640
the tribes feel about cannabis industry

77
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,919
are they ready for cannabis industry are

78
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,369
there are there tribes that maybe aren't

79
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:16,959
ready or feel apprehensive as them right

80
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:20,530
now cannabis has been a part of tribal

81
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,229
industry in Washington since 2015

82
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,419
so California's had some time to look at

83
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,759
this the tribes have had to some time to

84
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,189
look at this what has the initial

85
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,329
response spin and has it adapted over

86
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:38,639
time I'll start with chairwoman you know

87
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:40,919
Braithwaite hi hi thanks for having me

88
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,469
my name is Tina Braithwaite and I am the

89
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,500
tribal leader of the Benton Paiute Tribe

90
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:49,500
we're 40 miles east of Mammoth Lakes up

91
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,420
in the Sierras and we have the first

92
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,269
state recreational dispensary on our

93
00:04:51,420 --> 00:05:00,480
tribal lands we opened for 20 2017 and

94
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:04,469
since we've opened we have not had any

95
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,330
incidences on our tribal lands at all as

96
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,840
far as our dispensary

97
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:14,430
when we first legalized and passed

98
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:17,699
cannabis on our tribal lands we have out

99
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,829
of a hundred and forty tribal members we

100
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,469
had five notes

101
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:26,969
we were able to educate our people on

102
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:30,480
the positive side of cannabis and what

103
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,550
it's doing for not just our people but

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,430
people across the nation especially with

105
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,910
the opioid crisis you know our

106
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,819
government they feed people opioids

107
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,760
every day and get them addicted so I

108
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:52,860
believe that opioids are the entrants

109
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:56,339
drug and cannabis is the exit drug and I

110
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,470
have approximately 15 elders on our

111
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,649
reservation we make a topical with

112
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:04,650
cannabis through that topical it has

113
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:07,259
eliminated a lot of their opioid use and

114
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:10,169
now I have elders from other

115
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,810
reservations that have been asking you

116
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,730
know they come out to our dispensary

117
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,490
they purchase their products and they

118
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:20,939
leave we haven't had no issues with law

119
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:25,259
enforcement we have our own regulatory

120
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:28,230
body they regulate us sometimes I think

121
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:32,269
they over regulate us but we are in a

122
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:34,400
better situation than you all no offence

123
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:38,459
California who would have thought that

124
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:41,250
California would be behind Nevada when

125
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:44,408
Nevada ten years ago you went to jail

126
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,449
for six months for internal possession

127
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:48,098
and now here we are California was

128
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:52,538
supposed to be the leader in cannabis

129
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:54,968
and they're way behind Nevada but you

130
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:57,550
know hopefully the state will get to

131
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:59,379
where they need to be you know we've

132
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:03,728
just you know been doing our own thing

133
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:06,099
we manufacture we grow we manufacture we

134
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:08,829
have extraction and we send out all of

135
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:12,550
our products for testing to this nice

136
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:14,678
gentleman and his facility and we make

137
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,649
sure that our packaging we try to mirror

138
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:19,748
the state as close as we can you know so

139
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,968
that we don't have any issues and the

140
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:24,338
state they've been that the counties

141
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:26,678
have been real respectful the states

142
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:28,329
they haven't been to too good to us you

143
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:32,588
know they locked us out of the industry

144
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:35,189
we have no legal pathway and we're

145
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:39,610
forced to do a nation a nation right now

146

00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:43,000
Native American cannabis Association see

169
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:44,078
NACA us is our website if you'd like to

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,389
visit

171
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:49,269
we have 23 member tribes you know the

172
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:52,509
myth is that tribes across the country

173
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:54,669
particularly in California are rich off

174
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:55,959
of gaming right we make a lot of money

175
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:57,669
off of gaming

176
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,149
well the tribes that are interested in

177
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:01,839
cannabis

178
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:03,370
primarily or tribes that don't see

179
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,180
revenues from gaming they've been

180
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:10,240
marginalized into rural areas such as

181
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:13,569
this bishops such as Death Valley for

182
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,580
timber Shoshone or rural San Diego

183
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,200
County as ours is we don't have Gainey

184
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,210
we don't advocate you know we had a

185
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,920
casino I was a chairman they gave me

186
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:24,519
Commission up until we closed it in

187
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:26,740
February of 2014 so the myth is that

188
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,509
tries to make money off of gaming that's

189
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,000
just not the case for most of the

190
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:34,870
hundred and ten tribes in California and

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,580
sanaka we have 23 member tribes only

192
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,320
three of those tribes are gaming tribes

193
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,990
and they're exploring cannabis

194
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,090
absolutely it's an economic development

195
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,970
opportunity for tribes but most tribes

196
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,710
that are interested in cannabis like bet

197
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,769
and pie you'd like santa isabela are not

198
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,970
gaming tribes and we're not making money

199
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:54,340
we're not making money from a lot of

200
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,560
things and so canvas is an opportunity

201
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,259
for Santa Isabel we've been in this

202
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,599
business almost three years as soon as

203
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:03,309
the Wilkinson memmer memorandum came out

204
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,290
the tribe took a look at its

205
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:07,389
constitutional process passed the law

206
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:12,429
passed an ordinance created a regulatory

207
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:15,549
agency and we're now just south of 50

208
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:17,529
million dollars of non-tribal tenant

209
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:21,250
money invested in developing our

210
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:24,399
facility at Santa Isabel we have nine we

211
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,379
call them tenants nine enterprises

212
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,079
separate enterprises non-tribal owned

213
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:31,659
enterprises three of those are

214
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,350
manufacturers one is an organic waste

215
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:37,959
processor one is a certified testing lab

216
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,050
and I heard you talking about testing

217
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,650
regulations we predate the state of

218
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:45,909
California in every single area of

219
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:47,769
cannabis regulations including

220
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:50,559
laboratory testing so you said there's

221
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:52,539
one lab no no there's two the other ones

222
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,839
at Santa Isabel now they can't get state

223
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:57,399
licensed unfortunately due to the

224
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,519
bureaucracy here in the state and

225
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,639
intransigence but it is testing all the

226
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,559
way through the state's level three

227
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,949
regulations that we adopted over a year

228
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:11,949
ago we're doing it now we have an

229
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:14,709
organic waste processor for cannabis way

230
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,930
and the rest are cultivators and right

231
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:19,629
now as we said if all that cultivation

232
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:21,909
space were occupied with plants we'd be

233
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:24,639
looking at a quarter million plants

234
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:27,879
right now today so the tribe has a

235
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,639
substantial investment in cannabis we're

236
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:33,309
regulating 24/7 your Bureau of cannabis

237
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:37,480
control how offered how often are they

238
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:39,338
at your property we're there 24/7 I have

239
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,250
a regulatory staff that's there right

240
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:45,010
now because our facilities 24/7 we have

241
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,110
a 24/7 Mann surveillance room Mann

242
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:50,230
surveillance room not just the server

243
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,579
the DVR servers but live people watching

244
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,550
everything that's going on

245
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:57,969
bs is certified security guards armed

246
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:59,528
and unarmed our pesticide regulations

247
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,810
transportation regulations

248
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:04,328
laboratory testing regulations cannabis

249
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:07,000
race regulations as I mentioned predate

250
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:09,159
the state of California we're very

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,919
serious about this as many other tribes

252
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:16,110
in California the unfortunate thing is

253
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:19,719
when we get to talking about a benign 24

254
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:22,360
the state has thrown up a roadblock to

255
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,759
tribal participation in the California

256
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,399
cannabis market and this isn't a

257
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,338
government lesson but let me tell you

258
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,990
what sovereignty is the tribes it's like

259
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:35,079
asking a person to give up their

260
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,299
identity who you are as a person who you

261
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:40,750
are as a people we want you to give that

262
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:43,629
up and defer all of your culture all of

263
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,759
your laws all of your regulation all of

264
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,919
your government to the state of

265
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,500
California there's three political

266
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:54,399
subdivisions mentioned in the

267
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,769
Constitution the feds the state and

268
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,470
tribes says nothing about cities does

269
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:01,480
nothing about counties right we're on

270
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,490
par with the state the state should be

271
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,079
negotiating in a respectful

272
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,299
government-to-government basis for

273
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:09,849
tribal participation in the cannabis

274
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:11,948
market so let me explain to you an

275
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:15,819
answer your question how serious tribes

276
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:18,219
are Tina alluded to it we're creating a

277
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:20,559
tribe to tribe market what does that

278
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:24,000
mean for you while santa is about we

279
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,000
already have a handful of tribes

280
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,278
very close to us in some faraway who

281
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,139
want to be the recipients of that

282
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,360
manufactured and cultivated product that

283
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,399
we're now producing on our reservation

284
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,320
they're going to be selling it they're

285
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,620
going to be selling it to California

286
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,449
citizens now Santa Isabel Saint mention

287
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,089
we have a very robust regulatory

288
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,948
framework but imagine that there's a

289
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:50,949
tribe out there that says you know what

290
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:54,149
who needs regulations we can do anything

291
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:57,609
we want on our reservation no pesticide

292
00:13:54,149 --> 00:14:00,009
testing no laboratory testing no child

293
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,990
proofing no ingredient levels help

294
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:04,360
customers come to our reservation

295
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,759
we'll sell you whatever you want so what

296
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,940
the state of California has created by

297
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:13,269
keeping tribes out of this market is a

298
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,610
tribe to tribe market with some robust

299
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,610
regulation like Benton Paiute or Santa

300
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:21,550
Isabel and possibly less than robust

301
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,919
regulation that actually puts California

302
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:25,778
citizens at risk those consumers at

303
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,599
risks that's what the state of

304
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:30,100
California has created tribes aren't

305
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,199
going to walk away from this market

306
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,629
we're in it too far there's too much

307
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:37,269
money involved so there will be a tribe

308
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:39,100
to tribe market know by the way none of

309
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:41,198
the revenues generated from those

310
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,319
transactions go to the state of

311
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,778
California we don't participate in that

312
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:48,909
all of that money comes to the tribe and

313
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:50,948
tell me that we aren't going to be able

314
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:52,659
to offer our product a whole lot cheaper

315
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:55,448
than anyone else in the state of

316
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:57,610
California so we're pretty serious about

317
00:14:55,448 --> 00:15:01,929
cannabis all right Dave you covered a

318
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:04,600
lot of topics here one testing Truman

319
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:07,479
Braithwaite and I discussed that with

320
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,000
lab testing we now have a blockade where

321
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,889
in order to be testing with a licensed

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,500
facility in the state of California you

323
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:16,089
need to be a licensed entity so there's

324
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,458
some complications there obviously

325
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:21,250
they've found a solution by testing in

326
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:24,909
San Isabel Botanical Center you also

327
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:28,059
touched on how you're approaching this

328
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:31,059
in respect to the ability to distribute

329
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:33,250
to the state market so now we have an

330
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:35,899
institution where the tribes are working

331
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:40,399
together and what does that mean

332
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:41,959
the greater the greater enterprise that

333
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,169
we have within the state of California

334
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,460
if you are not complying with

335
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:48,919
regulations you're creating your own

336
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:52,580
regulations there's something to be

337
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:54,139
noted in fact that historically the

338
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,800
federal government questions whether or

339
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:59,960
not tribes could govern themselves and

340
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,120
the gaming tribes showed that that was

341
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,940
definitely possible and the Santa Isabel

342
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,190
Botanical Center has shown itself to be

343
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,790
regulating beyond what the state

344
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,280
requires

345
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:12,889
in one instance Dave and I discussed

346
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,559
that there was a dispensary in San Diego

347
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:17,720
a state-licensed dispensary and one of

348
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,759
the inspectors came in and said every

349
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,460
product on this shelf is failed

350
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,230
compliance except for this one and it

351
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,540
came from Santa Isabel Botanical Center

352
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,730
so the tribes are showing that not only

353
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:30,319
can they meet the needs but they can

354
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:36,200
also regulate the on what is required

355
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,629
for the state we also should address how

356
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,250
we are approaching this in terms of the

357
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:43,669
money that you mentioned so in

358
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,860
Washington for example this is going

359
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,829
back to sovereign nations creating a

360
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,139
compact in Washington the state

361
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,690
government and the tribes came to an

362
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:55,340
agreement and they said ok we don't

363
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,920
necessarily want people going to the

364
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,540
tribe and getting or the reservation and

365
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,829
getting a deal because we're concerned

366
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:02,959
about how that's gonna affect the state

367
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,910
market so they came to an agreement and

368
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,209
they said ok everybody's gonna charge

369
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:11,089
attack the state will charge this amount

370
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:13,430
and the tribes will charge on par but

371
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:15,619
the money that the tribes charge will go

372
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:18,950
back to the tribes and then they're able

373
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:21,229
to use that money to support economic

374
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,400
development which is one of the reasons

375
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,079
that we're talking about this because

376
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,140
we'd like for the tribes to have that

377
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,458
opportunity so with that money chair

378
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,530
when chairwoman Braithwaite and I

379
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:33,019
discuss that she had proposed the

380
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:35,420
possibility of a healthcare system for

381
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:37,339
the tribes where the descendants would

382
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,490
have access to the healthcare system and

383
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:43,339
in addition it would release a burden on

384
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,829
the state and here in California we have

385
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:47,659
what some would call a welfare state so

386
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:49,639
any opportunity

387
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,320
that burden would be welcomed chairwoman

388
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,540
Braithwaite could you potentially talk

389
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,099
to us about what your what your

390
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,559
challenges were there what you proposed

391
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:59,750
and then maybe max can talk to us about

392
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,669
what those issues are surrounding that

393
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:06,559
and why potentially that wasn't an

394
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:09,380
avenue for us to take okay so in the

395
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,119
beginning when we tried to get that

396
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,220
government-to-government consultation

397
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:17,299
with the governor's office and we were

398
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:20,049
refused we tried to create a program

399
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:24,440
where the tribes with charge attacks

400
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:27,289
equal to the state and those taxes will

401
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,460
go into a pot like the rst of monies and

402
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:32,960
they would be used for healthcare

403
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,890
hospitals in California there's not one

404
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,230
Native American Hospital in California

405
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:41,390
that IHS facilities that's the Indian

406
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,339
Health Services the federal government

407
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,500
claims they have a federal trust

408
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:48,199
responsibility to the tribes for health

409
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,299
care well where 400 years from now where

410
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,210
we'll see our first Indian Health

411
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:56,359
Services facility clinic excuse me

412
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:58,910
health clinic built in California so we

413
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:01,309
were trying to in the beginning create

414
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,960
that health care system for all Native

415
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:05,869
American people whether you were

416
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,130
enrolled member of California or not you

417
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:12,079
could be Cherokee you could be you know

418
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,270
sue wherever but if you could show that

419
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,699
you were Native American and you lived

420
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:18,500
in California you could go and be

421
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,640
treated at these health facilities for

422
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:25,940
free health care hospitals mental health

423
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,190
substance abuse aftercare which really

424
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:32,450
lacks in this country there's no

425
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:35,000
aftercare education elders programs

426
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:38,600
youth programs and we were going to try

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,700
to create after like a treatment not a

428
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:43,909
treatment but like a halfway house type

429
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,860
program for the Native American

430
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,870
prisoners that come out of the federal

431
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:50,599
prisons they could come in they would be

432
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:52,729
in a transitional house for 90 days get

433
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:55,279
on their feet get their birth

434
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:58,069
certificates their driver's license get

435
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,109
a job 90 days they would transition out

436
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:03,678
you know into their new you know

437
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:05,449
on their feet and on their way just to

438
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,519
try to help you know our Native American

439
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,860
people but that got killed in the

440
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:13,220
beginning the state you know there was a

441
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:15,169
lot of kickback from that nobody wanted

442
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,720
to do it it was like who's gonna manage

443
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,580
that program you know there was like how

444
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,230
are we gonna do that you know and then

445
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:23,750
the state just you know it just got

446
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,490
pushed to the side you know if we could

447
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,048
have created that structure how could

448
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,870
the state have said no to us we would

449
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:31,339
have took a burden off of the state

450
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:33,079
financially because every Native

451
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:35,269
American in this state would have been

452
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:37,039
eligible not to mention their

453
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:39,798
descendants and you know because right

454
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,678
now if you're a descendant of a tribe

455
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:44,779
and you're not readily recognized you

456
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:47,090
don't even qualify for education you

457
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:49,428
know you're just you you can apply for

458
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:51,740
grants but they want you to be a

459
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:54,019
federally recognized Native American so

460
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,150
you know we could have helped our own

461
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,119
people you know created our own health

462
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,710
care system but it got kicked out and

463
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:03,529
you know it's really unfortunate that

464
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:06,470
you know nobody really thought that that

465
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:10,539
would be a positive thing for you know a

466
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,539
win-win for the tribes and the state

467
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:16,819
well if I can just add one thing to what

468
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:20,870
Tina mentioned just so you understand

469
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:22,220
where tribes are at tribes are some of

470
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:25,119
the poorest communities in California

471
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,829
with the highest rates of unemployment

472
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:30,639
one of our counterparts Stuart Golson

473
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:33,079
that chairman from temperature Shoshone

474
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,340
didn't miss any opportunity at the

475
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:36,589
legislature with meeting with the

476
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:38,689
legislature around a benign 24 to

477
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:41,089
explain that our community is so poor

478
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:44,330
that we have to pass the Hat just a bury

479
00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:46,039
our dead and and you know from gaming

480
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:48,529
there's a thing called / kappa / kappa

481
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,178
is where you take the revenues from the

482
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:52,519
tribe you divide up by tribal members

483
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:54,048
and each tribal member gets a check it's

484
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,660
San Isabel when we structured our

485
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:59,539
statute we put a prohibition on any per

486
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:02,058
capita means every single dime generated

487
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:03,678
from cannabis by the tribe went to

488
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:06,470
tribal infrastructure and government

489
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,929
services much as Tina mentioned even my

490
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:11,720
fines and penalties fund because we do

491
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:13,470
fine are our tenants when they violate

492
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,298
the regs goes

493
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,610
the tribes general fund that's allocated

494
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:18,658
for drug prevention and use skill

495
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:20,759
building programs

496
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:24,440
none of that fine money even comes the

497
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:27,658
regulatory agency it goes for tribal

498
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,808
infrastructure sorry I started working

499
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:32,820
on tribal cannabis and work primarily on

500
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:34,019
terrible cannabis when I was working in

501
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:36,629
the state legislature

502
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:39,329
I've been lobbying for a year and a half

503
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:43,770
now for case three consulting K Street

504
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:47,009
does have tribal clients as in casino

505
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:50,240
tribes as well as we have one tribal

506
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:53,879
cannabis business that's on Isabel

507
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,009
territory and so we have you know those

508
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,590
angles but then from going back to the

509
00:22:56,009 --> 00:23:01,798
beginning working on the first tribal

510
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:06,178
cannabis bill the one remarkable thing

511
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:08,548
was that how how divisive the issue was

512
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,990
and how when we had all these different

513
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:12,720
state goals made the League of Cities

514
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,890
with the police chiefs we had the United

515
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,069
Food and Commercial Workers and the

516
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:21,090
Teamsters labor unions we had CCIA the

517
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:23,009
cal growers we have whomever else and

518
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:25,439
and also all the county organizations

519
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:28,019
that station State Association of

520
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,650
counties the rural counties urban

521
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:34,470
counties this issue United everyone else

522
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:37,320
like no other issue and Arab League

523
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:40,380
United them in opposition because every

524
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:43,678
single other stakeholder saw some waving

525
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,330
beliefs from allowing this to happen and

526
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:51,090
integrating this into the state

527
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:53,759
marketplace fundamentally the state and

528
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:58,259
federal rules and laws and jurisdictions

529
00:23:53,759 --> 00:24:01,679
are different on tribal land and the non

530
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:04,140
cannabis specific rules you know will

531
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,240
apply in different fashions I have a

532
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,230
brief example on labor laws there is

533
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,370
currently I think federal litigation and

534
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,490
stuff that's gone up to the Supreme

535
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:17,250
Court if I recall over that whether you

536
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:20,429
can go and organize workers on tribal

537
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:23,180
land or to what degree they follow the

538
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:25,820
NLRB process

539
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,759
organizing so it's fundamentally a

540
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:31,490
different creature and it's

541
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:35,420
fundamentally a different system of

542
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:39,799
governance beyond cannabis and because

543
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:43,400
of that it's so incredibly difficult to

544
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:47,539
fit cannabis regulations into a tribal

545
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:50,990
box or to fit tribal sovereignty into a

546
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:52,879
state cannabis regulations box and what

547
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,680
I appreciate admire about what the

548
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,980
chairmen are what the chairwoman and

549
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:03,440
what suhaka has done is a bee 924 really

550
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:06,110
eliminated and worked with all the

551
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,930
opposition I listed before and bring all

552
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:12,589
of them you know if not you know some

553
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:14,690
support many neutral and as close to not

554
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:17,299
opposing as they could and they did a

555
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:21,140
really admirable job crafting that

556
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:25,669
compromise and yet it still got torn

557
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:28,400
apart and it still got rejected by the

558
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:30,950
committees and with without really

559
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,410
understanding the steps and hard work

560
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:38,450
that gone into it I feel the feeling

561
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:41,120
wasn't recognized the one thing is that

562
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,559
next year we have a new governor we have

563
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,629
a new legislature some legislative

564
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,740
changes for more so we have a new

565
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:50,990
governor and I am hopeful that the next

566
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,900
administration will be willing to engage

567
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,420
more actively and thoroughly and early

568
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,030
on rectifying this tribal cannabis issue

569
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,950
and trying to solve it and trying to go

570
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:05,599
come up with the compromise than the

571
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:08,180
last one get when Ariel Clarke started

572
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:11,059
her career she didn't nnq focus her

573
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:13,279
efforts on tribal law some attorneys

574
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:14,929
spend their whole lives just completely

575
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,259
focused on this one subject this is

576
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:20,120
quite complicated and Ariel's been

577
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:22,700
working with the California in Native

578
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:25,099
American Association she understands

579
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,990
what some of these issues are she is

580
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:28,609
Native Americans can you speak to us

581
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,769
about some of the issues that we're

582
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:32,839
facing in regards to Native American

583
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:34,940
cannabis in the state of California and

584
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:35,839
what some of the issues are that we

585
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:40,640
should address

586
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:47,659
in creating a pathway forward thank you

587
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:51,980
so much um so our i-i've been focusing

588
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:55,190
also on cannabis and we work with a lot

589
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:57,410
of growers and dispensary operators and

590
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,789
lots of people who are in the cannabis

591
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:02,029
industry and then I also have a

592
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:04,069
background in Indian law and we work

593
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:08,990
with tribes on developing their tribal

594
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:11,960
cannabis programs and this intersection

595
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:14,000
between tribes in California and

596
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,340
cannabis is one that I just want to take

597
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,859
a moment to kind of talk about what this

598
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:20,779
looks like we all know that California

599
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:23,149
is the fifth largest economy in the

600
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:25,490
world nearly half of the cannabis market

601
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,860
is in California there are a hundred and

602
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:31,640
ten tribes in California and thousands

603
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:34,879
of acres are within the jurisdiction of

604
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:37,250
California Indian tribes these tribes

605
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,220
have been here since the beginning of

606
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:43,130
time I talked with an elder larry

607
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:46,100
benegas who actually passed away a

608
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:50,720
couple of weeks ago who really was

609
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:53,449
involved in cannabis and healing for

610
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,329
Native people and he told me that

611
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:58,490
cannabis has been used in California

612
00:27:56,329 --> 00:28:01,579
amongst the native people for thousands

613
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:03,799
and thousands of years so here I am

614
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:07,369
maybe I don't know I started working

615
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:10,819
with cannabis businesses in 2005 and

616
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:13,489
encouraged all of my clients to support

617
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:15,619
regulations and pass a whole series of

618
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:19,190
laws in California so that we could have

619
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:23,239
a regulated cannabis market and by the

620
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:26,210
way grow cannabis on land and sell

621
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,650
cannabis on land that are the I'm a I'm

622
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:31,480
from Michigan my tribe is in Michigan

623
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:36,800
but that are on these people's lands and

624
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:39,769
the absolute outrageousness that tribes

625
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:43,220
in California do not have the

626
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:46,099
opportunity to enter into the regulated

627
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,029
market and sell into and sell between

628
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,399
tribes

629
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:52,059
and the California cannabis you know

630
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:55,490
that the larger commercial market is

631
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:57,429
completely outrageous other states have

632
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:01,279
figured that out through a compact model

633
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:04,880
tribes clearly I mean listen to what

634
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:06,920
Dave has said it and and and and

635
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,100
chairwoman Braithwaite as well tribes

636
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:13,220
can clearly regulate themselves

637
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:15,169
incredibly well we and with these two

638
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:18,200
and many other people involved in

639
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,940
Senecas efforts and other folks went

640
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,250
kindly went to the state of California

641
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,720
and said look we will you know here's

642
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:28,039
here's a way that we can work together

643
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:30,799
on this and that has been rejected and I

644
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:33,769
also I have to say max your statements

645
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,149
about you know this unifying issue it's

646
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:38,170
really amazing

647
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:41,630
I saw people clients of mine who were

648
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:44,269
California cannabis operators be deathly

649
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,860
afraid of tribes getting into cannabis

650
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:47,359
because they looked at it like tribes

651
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:49,189
will have some sort of edge on the

652
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,199
market or these operators that are on

653
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,400
tribal land will have an edge and that's

654
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,380
unfair to me

655
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,680
and you know I'm think looking at this

656
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:00,440
guy and thinking you hmm

657
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,390
you care about your stakeholders so much

658
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,789
and you don't understand or let me

659
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:07,490
hopefully I can help educate you and and

660
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:09,529
help you understand how this will

661
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,809
benefit these communities where

662
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:14,779
literally most people are at or below

663
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:16,869
the poverty level like when when do we

664
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:19,549
decide that being completely

665
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:22,429
self-interested and money obsessed is

666
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:26,119
something that is like maybe not the

667
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:28,100
move forward globally you know and when

668
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,500
we've had these opportunities in this

669
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:32,869
state to create laws and rules and

670
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:38,259
regulations in a culture and this is

671
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:43,639
what's happening is really a pourraient

672
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:46,579
so on that happy note the reaiiy I

673
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,710
really I just want to thank you Courtney

674
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:50,480
so much and theater so much and

675
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,960
everybody for coming here and paying

676
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,788
attention to this issue I guess

677
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,360
I know I'm not really answering the

678
00:30:55,788 --> 00:31:01,970
question but I just you know this is it

679
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,038
there is still an opportunity to create

680
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:06,890
some sort of change around this and I

681
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:09,230
fully support tribes having you know a

682
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:11,299
little bit of California if people can't

683
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:15,079
get it together and let the tribes I

684
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:17,298
mean not let you will and excellent and

685
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:20,148
I am cheering you on and so are we all

686
00:31:17,298 --> 00:31:22,460
to have a very thriving cannabis market

687
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:25,489
but let me also say this for our clients

688
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,769
that our cannabis we represent a lot of

689
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:31,490
legacy cannabis operators in California

690
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:34,069
and what an opportunity it would be to

691
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:36,558
be able to think about it they're only

692
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:38,240
15% of cities and counties are giving

693
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,970
cannabis licenses so now I'm talking to

694
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,740
you guys who want to have a you know if

695
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,778
you aren't already licensed or you want

696
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,230
to expand your footprint in California

697
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:51,109
to have the opportunity to grow on

698
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:53,089
tribal land and these folks are you know

699
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:56,319
your your within their jurisdiction

700
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:58,908
under their very regulated whole a

701
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:01,129
tribal cannabis program there is a

702
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:03,110
massive opportunity when 85 percent of

703
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,360
the cities in counties in California you

704
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:07,849
guys don't give a shit about giving

705
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:11,629
cannabis licenses you have tribes that

706
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:14,750
are art would be very happy to open

707
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:17,000
those doors but there we need to have an

708
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:20,210
opportunity for those businesses to sell

709
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,950
into the regulated market so you know

710
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:24,980
when we think about sort of how do we

711
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:27,740
all win in situations that is is a nice

712
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:31,069
thing to think about with public safety

713
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:34,538
yes with having products that come to

714
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:37,158
California consumers that are tested and

715
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:40,700
well regulated but also opportunities

716
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:44,419
for businesspeople to potentially work

717
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:47,120
with tribes and our firm is works with a

718
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:50,450
number of tribes and and developers and

719
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:53,839
folks who are anyway all in the tribal

720
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:58,000
cannabis context so there's a lot here

721
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,000
so thanks for paying attention

722
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,889
so I just want to bring ease a few

723
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,650
moments where it might be really lovely

724
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,580
to go to the reservation and experience

725
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,320
cannabis

726
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:16,759
yes healing is very important medicinal

727
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:20,359
opportunities Native Americans hold

728
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:22,339
sacred the healing medicine of plants

729
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:24,439
I'm reading a book on Native American

730
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:25,759
plant medicine right now and it's

731
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,920
something we don't all know about

732
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,140
because it is sacred we don't get a hear

733
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,800
of all these matters there's also the

734
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:35,960
opportunity to go to a cannabis resort

735
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:38,210
there was a team in South Dakota that

736
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,710
wanted to put together a resort and it

737
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,660
was shut down by the local government

738
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,610
here in California we've had several

739
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,420
tribes that tried to create operations

740
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:47,509
and we're shut down

741
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:49,370
over the course of the last few years so

742
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:52,490
we're in a moment now where we're trying

743
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:54,709
to create a space where everybody is on

744
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,870
common ground and is happy and finding

745
00:33:54,710 --> 00:34:01,640
solutions sharing women appraised it

746
00:33:56,869 --> 00:34:04,609
would like to speak to this so as I said

747
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:08,900
earlier we're 40 miles east of Mammoth

748
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:11,359
Lakes up by Mammoth ski resort and we

749
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:14,480
are looking at doing a destination

750
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,309
resort cannabis friendly destination

751
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,449
resort where you can come and get a

752
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:23,570
cannabis in Hugh's massage you can maybe

753
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:26,119
have some cannabis cuisine maybe you can

754
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:30,200
have a cup of cannabis coffee with the

755
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:33,799
THC infused edible you know we're just

756
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:35,779
trying to get out there and do you know

757
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,870
some positive things around cannabis

758
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:42,110
because it's all about education you

759
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:45,079
know that stigma of getting high and you

760
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:45,920
know it's a it's a gateway drug you know

761
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:47,989
those days are gone

762
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,440
we just need to educate the public on

763
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:55,250
the Metis medicinal side and the healing

764
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,869
properties of cannabis CBD and you know

765
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:02,239
I I heard you guys's issues about those

766
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:04,429
the festivals and the consumption well

767
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,849
guess what we don't have those issues on

768
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:07,889
the reservations

769
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:10,980
so you know if you don't want to do a

770
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:12,869
music festival and consume a little bit

771
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,460
of cannabis by all means reach out to

772
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:18,119
some of these tribes because I'm sure

773
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:24,780
they'll be open to that as an event

774
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:27,059
producer I will go ahead and say yes we

775
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:29,970
already know whenever when it opens

776
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:31,440
absolutely absolutely okay so now that

777
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:33,089
we're all on board we all want to

778
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,700
support Native American cannabis what

779
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,740
are the solutions what can we do now to

780
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:40,109
create a space we know there were some

781
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:43,019
issues with a benign 24 not everybody

782
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:45,120
come to a good a good agreement on that

783
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:47,519
there were some issues some education

784
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,929
that needed to be happening also we

785
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:50,219
needed more panels like this do you

786
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:52,259
shine a light on Native American

787
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:54,209
cannabis and what we want it what's next

788
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,860
what are our next steps and how can we

789
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,590
all come together how can we convince

790
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,599
everyone that this is the Avenue this is

791
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,990
the pathway we can all work together

792
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,699
it's not it's not an infringement on the

793
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:08,129
existing owners and operators within

794
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:11,429
California it's not an obstacle for

795
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:13,829
those who wish to license their entity

796
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:16,019
it's an opportunity for all of us to

797
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:18,179
create a beautiful cannabis industry of

798
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:20,130
the future how do we get there what are

799
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:22,409
the next steps as of right now max

800
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,570
you're talking about next year we're to

801
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:26,579
have a new new government in place and

802
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,769
regards to legislation so we have some

803
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:31,349
new players what do we need to be

804
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:33,059
sending you there and say and you tell

805
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:34,949
them that we want Native American amis

806
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:36,840
what what are some of the issues that we

807
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:40,439
can address and how can we put everybody

808
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:42,920
on the same on the same a line of I was

809
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,920
the offense

810
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,389
well you can send me there but it's to

811
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:53,700
be determined what I can actually say

812
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:55,949
and and part of that is something we

813
00:36:53,699 --> 00:37:00,539
haven't talked about as much in this

814
00:36:55,949 --> 00:37:02,309
discussion which is there is all this

815
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:04,500
industry opposition or law enforcement

816
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:07,590
or local government or all the other

817
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,690
stakeholders they weren't cannabis

818
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:13,460
friendly or that weren't oil cans

819
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:16,320
friendly the other question though is

820
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,990
how are we getting or working with the

821
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,800
larger tribes and the large tribes

822
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:25,679
smaller tribe interactions there because

823
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:29,310
that you know my firm represents several

824
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:31,409
larger gaming tribes and for me to go to

825
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:33,869
work on this issue requires me to not

826
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:35,940
have a conflict on this issue it

827
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:37,889
requires me to educate and work with

828
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,079
those larger tribes so they recognize

829
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:42,359
and appreciate respect their work being

830
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:47,969
done and the goals of the smaller tribes

831
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:50,070
that don't have that I think just so I

832
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:52,709
think that's part of the big question

833
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:55,050
for me and with this is is the

834
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,579
engagement with the larger tribes along

835
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,250
with the engagement of the Newsom

836
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:01,819
administration from some conversations I

837
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:04,349
had with the state licensing authorities

838
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:08,580
maybe it's too close with the state

839
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:11,969
licensing authorities is that this rule

840
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:16,529
and tribal cannabis came from on high it

841
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:18,149
was a it was an order from the higher

842
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,730
levels of government than the state

843
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,710
regulators to go and put in their

844
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:25,079
regulations a waiver of sovereign

845
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,269
immunity a pathway to licensure for

846
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,309
tribes which isn't really a pathway

847
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:31,559
because of the labor and because the

848
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:33,779
local authorization requirements but

849
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:36,420
that wasn't their choice they didn't

850
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:40,250
have statutory supposed to thority to do

851
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,250
that and

852
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:47,219
ultimately we've got ultimately a new

853
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:49,380
administration can give a new order and

854
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:52,049
you don't change that conversation and

855
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,539
so I think that is it's about a a large

856
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:57,150
tribe strategy educational strategy and

857
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:59,730
a new sim administration strategy and

858
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,769
I'm fairly confident will be Gavin

859
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:15,990
Newsome and not Republican John Cox

860
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:18,630
because yeah certainly sanaka has a seat

861
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:21,539
at the table we are gearing up at the

862
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:25,050
end of the month to renew our efforts to

863
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:28,289
revive 9:24 or something like it for

864
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:30,869
those of you that don't know tri-c NACA

865
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:34,380
member types of 23 member tribes that

866
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:36,570
back nine twenty four were gave up a lot

867
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:40,010
there were a lot of compromises on

868
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:42,930
behalf of the tribes this woman

869
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:48,480
late-night rants what the hell are we

870
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:52,559
doing yeah beat up quite a bit but the

871
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:56,010
design was tribes agreeing to come under

872
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:57,960
the same regulatory framework as the

873
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:00,300
state as any other entity in the state

874
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,480
of California without having to give up

875
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:06,000
our civil regulatory authority and our

876
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,480
tribal sovereignty so the pathway is

877
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,329
convincing folks that a consistent

878
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,059
regulatory structure with the California

879
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:18,469
cannabis consumer first and foremost in

880
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:24,108
thought is in everyone's best interests

881
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:27,959
at the end of the day so when we first

882
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:33,900
started the negotiations when you know

883
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:38,929
with the state our main goal was to

884
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:41,309
preserve our sovereignty that was never

885
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:43,259
nothing was going to ever take away our

886
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:45,570
sovereignty because the way I explained

887
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,780
our sovereignty is if the governor of

888
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:50,780
California wanted to waive the rights of

889
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,980
every one of you people in the audience

890
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:56,250
he could not do that with

891
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:59,219
a vote of Europe of the people right

892
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,170
you cannot waive your rights he could

893
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:03,569
not waive your rights in California to

894
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:05,309
Nevada and say okay California residents

895
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:08,190
you're all you have no rights now

896
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:10,889
because I just waved them to Nevada

897
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:13,679
that's how sovereignty is with tribes we

898
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:16,920
are peer jurisdictions to the state we

899
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:19,618
are not below the state we are not below

900
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,230
the counties or the cities we are equal

901
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:24,269
to the states we are our own sovereign

902
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:27,990
nations so for us to waive sovereign

903
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:30,300
immunity was not even at the table we

904
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:32,489
cannot tribal leaders cannot just waive

905
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,859
our sovereign immunity with a signature

906
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:38,699
it doesn't work that way I would be hung

907
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:42,389
by my toes by my people so that was

908
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:45,809
never an option so we tried to preserve

909
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:47,819
our sovereign immunity at all costs we

910
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:51,269
did try to make a deal with the state

911
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:55,050
saying that all sales on reservation

912
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:56,849
tribes would keep those taxes once our

913
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:59,760
product leaves the reservation it goes

914
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:02,730
into the retail market then those taxes

915
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,180
will go to the state I'm like Washington

916
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:08,760
where if a product leaves the

917
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:11,099
reservation and well if a product is

918
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,680
sold on reservation Washington state

919
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:15,480
keeps those taxes and once the product

920
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:19,108
leaves the reservation and goes out into

921
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,719
the retail market those taxes go back to

922
00:42:19,108 --> 00:42:24,869
the tribes we were not trying to do that

923
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:27,449
we were trying to be fair and allow

924
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:29,190
California to also get you know their

925
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:31,230
tax money and the states and the

926
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,539
counties will get their tax money but it

927
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:36,358
never worked that way you know we

928
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:38,880
weren't gonna set bad presidents by you

929
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:41,340
know allowing you know the tribes to

930
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,890
waive sovereign immunity and we did not

931
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:46,320
agree to the state coming into our

932
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:48,929
tribal lands and taxing our non tribal

933
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,300
investors and those taxes going back to

934
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:53,009
the state because those taxes need to

935
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,800
stay with the tribes anything that

936
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,810
happens in our sovereign nations need to

937
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,030
stay within our sovereign nations that's

938
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:02,019
the way it is we're not sitting back

939
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,700
presidents and yes I am the

940
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:07,940
the villain and all of this because I

941
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:10,789
said no we're not doing it and hopefully

942
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:13,639
the state we can educate them on tribal

943
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:15,949
sovereignty that tribes our governments

944
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:18,949
and that we ourselves have our own

945
00:43:15,949 --> 00:43:20,929
people that we need to support and you

946
00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:23,059
know through insurance and you know

947
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:25,669
programs essential programs substance

948
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:27,858
abuse we have all our own programs that

949
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,510
we need to support you know and you know

950
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:31,400
if we could do those things we would

951
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:33,619
take a big burden off the state you know

952
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,480
we would be self-sustaining the state

953
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:37,789
went we wouldn't have to worry about all

954
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,949
these poor tribes you know we would

955
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:42,820
support ourselves you know so that that

956
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:45,559
was real important to us to you know

957
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,420
maintain our integrity because at the

958
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:49,670
end of the day when we die that's all we

959
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:52,280
have is our name in our integrity and

960
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:54,530
you know if we start setting bad

961
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,970
presidents in Indian country you know

962
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,490
what does that say for our future

963
00:43:55,969 --> 00:44:00,709
generations every decision we make right

964
00:43:58,489 --> 00:44:02,899
now as a tribal leader affects our

965
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:05,539
future generations and if I waive

966
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,710
sovereign immunity for cannabis the next

967
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:08,420
thing I'm going to be waiving sovereign

968
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,190
immunity for this and I'm going to be

969
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,450
waiving sovereign immunity for that and

970
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,909
I'm not going to have sovereign immunity

971
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:16,549
and we won't have a sovereign nation

972
00:44:13,909 --> 00:44:18,739
when my future generations you know are

973
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:28,519
leading our country our nation's so

974
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:30,409
that's why we said no I think that

975
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:32,630
you're touching on on something and

976
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:34,009
that's that there are matters here there

977
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:36,650
were actually bigger than cannabis

978
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:39,830
cannabis is bringing subject matter to

979
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:41,030
our cognition and saying you know these

980
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:42,949
are issues that have been here they've

981
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:44,300
been here for a long time and cannabis

982
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:47,029
is giving us an opportunity to look at

983
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:49,910
them and speak about them in public and

984
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:53,240
to the government and it leaves me to

985
00:44:49,909 --> 00:44:54,500
point out that the climate for Native

986
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:56,419
American cannabis and cannabis in

987
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,809
general at the federal level has not

988
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:02,240
been supported in December of 2014 we

989
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:05,179
had the Wilkinson memo and when I read

990
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,939
it I interpret it to mean that given

991
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:09,739
certain jurisdictional concerns tribes

992
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,659
had sovereignty and they could cultivate

993
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:14,919
cannabis when I called the governor's

994
00:45:11,659 --> 00:45:17,348
office and spoke to their

995
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,180
they are liaison for native or tribal

996
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:21,609
affairs I was told that they don't

997
00:45:19,179 --> 00:45:23,199
interpret it in that way that to me was

998
00:45:21,608 --> 00:45:25,328
a little bit of a trigger I was a little

999
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:28,179
bit taken aback by that that what seems

1000
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:28,869
so simple to me and and I have studied

1001
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:30,039
law

1002
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:32,798
I was clinical science major in

1003
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:34,630
University I'm not an attorney all my

1004
00:45:32,798 --> 00:45:36,190
best friends are attorneys but I'm not

1005
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:37,390
an attorney so if I'm interpreting it

1006
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:39,400
this way and it seems very

1007
00:45:37,389 --> 00:45:40,868
straightforward to me I'm surprised to

1008
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,289
hear that the governor's office does not

1009
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:46,450
support that as an interpretation so I

1010
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:48,219
don't feel like the the big climate has

1011
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:50,469
been very friendly to cannabis in

1012
00:45:48,219 --> 00:45:52,779
general but more so for a tribal

1013
00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:54,789
cannabis so I would say to anyone that's

1014
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,170
watching for all of you that have taken

1015
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:59,739
the time to join us here this evening

1016
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:02,920
please do your part to support tribal

1017
00:45:59,739 --> 00:46:06,219
cannabis and our ability to not only to

1018
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:08,920
purchase but also to distribute to test

1019
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:11,289
and to find a way for all of us to work

1020
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:15,000
together so that we can have a greater a

1021
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:17,679
greater industry of tomorrow we have

1022
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,969
probably a few minutes to take some Q&amp;A

1023
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:23,588
before we do this is a very passionate

1024
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:25,689
conversation that we're having when we

1025
00:46:23,588 --> 00:46:27,670
talked in private it would have been

1026
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:29,679
much more dramatic so you're not

1027
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:33,159
witnessing that here today we're really

1028
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:35,440
toning it down but it's a very serious

1029
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:37,348
issue for us we're grateful to have this

1030
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,849
platform to speak to you all about it

1031
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:43,420
does anyone have anything they'd like to

1032
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:45,160
share before we reintroduce QA about how

1033
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:48,280
we can create a legal framework or

1034
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:55,058
create a space to bring another bill to

1035
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:57,160
the table that succeeds so right now

1036
00:46:55,059 --> 00:47:02,380
there's a bill and it's a federal bill

1037
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:04,899
it's called the s30 3 to senator

1038
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,930
Elizabeth Warren is authoring this bill

1039
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:10,809
and it's called it States Act I know a

1040
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:13,419
lot of people aren't aware of this but

1041
00:47:10,809 --> 00:47:14,829
when the Wilkinson memo was rescinded it

1042
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:17,289
didn't just affect the tribes that

1043
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:19,150
affect everybody across the nation

1044
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:23,798
because it's federally illegal

1045
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:27,730
everywhere so what this bill is gonna do

1046
00:47:23,798 --> 00:47:31,030
for not just tribes but for everybody

1047
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:34,719
if the state has legalized cannabis in

1048
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:36,990
their respected states then the federal

1049
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:40,779
government cannot come in and enforce

1050
00:47:36,989 --> 00:47:43,269
they cannot enforce and that language

1051
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,640
includes tribes so once that if that

1052
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:47,829
bill gets passed you know the big gaming

1053
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:49,299
tribes are going to climb down off their

1054
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:52,089
fence and they're gonna dive into some

1055
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,310
cannabis because right now everybody's

1056
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:56,710
fearing federal enforcement so if you

1057
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:59,820
guys can you know see your way to

1058
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:03,849
support that bill it's s 303 to

1059
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:05,320
Elizabeth Warren is authoring it and you

1060
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:09,519
know I think it would be a good positive

1061
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:11,588
thing if we could get that passed I just

1062
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,300
want to mention that in rescinding the

1063
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:15,250
Wilkinson memo sessions recently the

1064
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,320
Vulcan semi MO and the Cole memo in

1065
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:19,030
doing so he gave all the district

1066
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,730
attorneys the opportunity to decide

1067
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:23,980
their own priorities for enforcement so

1068
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:26,588
does anyone have anything they can speak

1069
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:28,269
to you and we're going to sue our own US

1070
00:48:26,588 --> 00:48:33,940
district attorney and what the climate

1071
00:48:28,269 --> 00:48:36,190
is there so I went up and spoke with the

1072
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:40,900
assistant US attorney in Sacramento

1073
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:45,730
about three months ago and I was told by

1074
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:49,180
him that we are not on his high priority

1075
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:51,039
for enforcement list so you know they

1076
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:52,358
have a lot of bigger fish to fry out

1077
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:56,019
there they're looking at the bigger

1078
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:57,460
cultivators so tribes aren't really I

1079
00:48:56,019 --> 00:49:00,489
mean we're on their radar they're

1080
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:03,338
watching us but as long as we do what we

1081
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:06,068
told them that we were do and follow and

1082
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:08,259
regulate self-regulate we're testing

1083
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:10,449
we're trying to mirror and be respectful

1084
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,700
of the state even though they weren't

1085
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:15,879
respectful to us we're still trying to

1086
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:18,608
keep that you know we're testing we're

1087
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,950
packaging you know labeling we're doing

1088
00:49:18,608 --> 00:49:24,098
everything to mirror the state as close

1089
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:26,439
as we can we promised we wouldn't take

1090
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:28,900
our product out of state you know so

1091
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,869
we're being respectful in that way but

1092
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,369
you know I mean they're watching they

1093
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:35,740
know what's going on they know what

1094
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:37,990
tribes are doing what and you know as

1095
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,868
long as you know we do what we say we're

1096
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:41,699
gonna do because like I said our

1097
00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:44,970
in our integrity you know that's

1098
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:47,248
everything to us and you know if I have

1099
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:49,108
I asked him when you know if you decide

1100
00:49:47,248 --> 00:49:51,209
you want to come down and enforce on my

1101
00:49:49,108 --> 00:49:53,130
reservation you don't need to come with

1102
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:55,650
your 50 guns and your officers are

1103
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:58,230
blazing just call me I'll come back to

1104
00:49:55,650 --> 00:50:02,099
Sacramento we'll have lunch we'll

1105
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:04,139
discuss it like adults and you know but

1106
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:06,210
don't come down there trying to act

1107
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:08,969
badass because it's just not gonna work

1108
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:15,749
for us but yeah so he was respectful in

1109
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:17,068
that way sure so the three words the

1110
00:50:15,748 --> 00:50:19,528
watchwords that we used for our

1111
00:50:17,068 --> 00:50:22,139
enterprise and count in in Santa at

1112
00:50:19,528 --> 00:50:25,259
Sandersville collaborative cautious and

1113
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:27,838
conservative we started very small we

1114
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:29,699
move very slowly and we have an absolute

1115
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,768
open-door policy when it comes to

1116
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:35,338
properly credentialed law enforcement

1117
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:37,558
state local or federal I came from law

1118
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:39,078
enforcement 35 years I spent 20 years of

1119
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:43,759
the Bureau of narcotic enforcement

1120
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:47,548
probably targeting it anyway never mind

1121
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:49,108
won't go there a lot of the folks a lot

1122
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:50,579
of the law enforcement coats in Southern

1123
00:50:49,108 --> 00:50:53,248
California in the Southern District

1124
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:55,589
where we're at in San Diego I know

1125
00:50:53,248 --> 00:51:00,058
firsthand they come up and visit we've

1126
00:50:55,588 --> 00:51:01,920
had DEA agents DEA investigators I just

1127
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:04,680
had the sheriff's lieutenant for our

1128
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,489
local region there two days ago because

1129
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:11,399
we're team teaching a class at Pechanga

1130
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:14,670
gaming class at Pechanga next week it's

1131
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,440
it's just not that big a deal if you

1132
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:19,499
stay within if you're a tribe and you

1133
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,470
stay within the envelope that the state

1134
00:51:19,498 --> 00:51:24,838
has constructed even though state law

1135
00:51:22,469 --> 00:51:27,929
doesn't apply on the reservation we

1136
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:30,480
found that if our regulations if what we

1137
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:32,909
allow is consistent with what's allowed

1138
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,940
in the remainder of the state we're fine

1139
00:51:32,909 --> 00:51:38,670
and so far with our US Attorney with our

1140
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,829
DEA with our sheriff and other law

1141
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:44,568
enforcement folks it's just not an issue

1142
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:44,568
we're yesterday's news

1143
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:53,650
and with that we can begin our QA anyone

1144
00:51:51,068 --> 00:51:55,420
have any questions for the panel I have

1145
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:58,349
one here in the back and I'll paraphrase

1146
00:51:55,420 --> 00:52:01,420
your questions that everything here

1147
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:03,519
sub-tribes will span multiple states so

1148
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:05,798
in regard to the question we might ask

1149
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:06,509
how are you transporting across state

1150
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:10,778
lines

1151
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:14,278
how are you potentially creating

1152
00:52:10,778 --> 00:52:17,949
distribution channels yeah that's easy

1153
00:52:14,278 --> 00:52:20,608
easy so if your tribe goes into two

1154
00:52:17,949 --> 00:52:24,939
states like say California and Nevada

1155
00:52:20,608 --> 00:52:27,969
you can actually open operations in

1156
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:30,159
Nevada and in California you would have

1157
00:52:27,969 --> 00:52:32,980
to get a compact through Nevada

1158
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:36,038
the governor has compacted with 27

1159
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:38,500
tribes of Nevada so all you would those

1160
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:40,630
the lands in Nevada would fall under the

1161
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:43,960
structure of Nevada and then of course

1162
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:47,829
you know you could do California but why

1163
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,389
would you want to because probably so I

1164
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:52,450
mean that's how it works whatever the

1165
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:54,159
state if it's legal in that part of the

1166
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:56,739
state where you know part of your land

1167
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:59,259
is then I would if you were gonna do

1168
00:52:56,739 --> 00:53:02,229
that I would do the research to see what

1169
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:06,490
what's the structure what's the what are

1170
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:09,639
the state laws and you know how hard is

1171
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:14,288
it you know to get it either a license

1172
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:15,969
or your compact with regard to

1173
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:19,059
transportation Sandersville we have a

1174
00:53:15,969 --> 00:53:21,818
prohibition on any cannabis from Santa

1175
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:25,359
Isabel leaving the state of California

1176
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:29,139
in fact it can only go to a jurisdiction

1177
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:31,449
a dispensary of retail outlet that

1178
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:34,328
allows cannabis so we don't even allow

1179
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:36,009
our cannabis to go into local

1180
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:39,150
jurisdictions that prohibit cannabis

1181
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:41,470
with regard to the multi-state tribes

1182
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:43,599
Santa Isabel consults for a number of

1183
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:46,598
tribes tribes that are along the

1184
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:49,829
California Arizona border Arizona is a

1185
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:52,349
no cannabis state so our advice is

1186
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:55,000
establish your commercial enterprise

1187
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:57,068
within the state where it's legal not

1188
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,449
within the state where it is not legal

1189
00:53:57,068 --> 00:54:00,070
because your

1190
00:53:58,449 --> 00:54:01,239
bound to garner the attention of the

1191
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,039
federal government not the state

1192
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:04,179
government but rather the federal

1193
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,929
government if you're operating in the

1194
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:06,929
state where it's prohibited

1195
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:19,349
yeah Washington and Nevada and our

1196
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,349
advice would be do what they did in

1197
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:25,119
Oregon yeah in Oregon if we have all

1198
00:54:22,269 --> 00:54:28,358
these tribes across the nation what is

1199
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:31,960
the opportunity for them to be unified

1200
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:33,190
on for example regulations if the

1201
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,099
federal government of the United States

1202
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:37,690
is going to I think we all are on the

1203
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:42,000
same page or that it's gonna happen

1204
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:45,579
eventually if they're going to permit

1205
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,219
legal cannabis there's gonna be statutes

1206
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:50,950
that are uniform is there anything that

1207
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:55,239
the tribes can do as sovereign nations

1208
00:54:50,949 --> 00:54:58,358
and win themselves to create a unified

1209
00:54:55,239 --> 00:55:02,319
platform in regards to regulations

1210
00:54:58,358 --> 00:55:04,449
public safety enforcement distribution

1211
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,940
all the issues that we're facing here in

1212
00:55:04,449 --> 00:55:13,049
California and trying to and try to

1213
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:17,190
trying to create a legal framework so we

1214
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:19,269
formed the California Native American

1215
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:22,150
California Native American cannabis

1216
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:24,969
Association for California and we also

1217
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:27,818
are in the process of creating a tribal

1218
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:30,669
nations cannabis Association for tribes

1219
00:55:27,818 --> 00:55:34,960
across the nation so that we can all be

1220
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:37,318
uniform we can all help each other set

1221
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:42,099
each other up with policies and

1222
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:45,130
ordinances and regulations and that way

1223
00:55:42,099 --> 00:55:47,200
we're doing it right you know tribes

1224
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:49,450
want to just have the legal pathway we

1225
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:52,509
want to do it right that's why we're

1226
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:53,769
compliant with marrying this date as

1227
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:58,440
close as we can

1228
00:55:53,769 --> 00:56:02,739
packaging testing flavoring all of that

1229
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:07,510
so my vision is that if the federal

1230
00:56:02,739 --> 00:56:09,729
government makes this legal for tribes

1231
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:13,390
that we can do a nation and nation

1232
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:16,150
Network you know maybe I'm growing and

1233
00:56:13,389 --> 00:56:19,599
there's a tribe across the nation that

1234
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:22,030
has is it a highly populated area where

1235
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,880
they don't want to grow so that they can

1236
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:27,100
dispense you know we all know how easy

1237
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,010
it is I put our dispensary up in two

1238
00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:33,279
weeks I mean yeah it wasn't you know

1239
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:35,200
where it needed to be but it is now but

1240
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,820
I did what I call a pop-up dispensary

1241
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:38,949
and we were off and running in within

1242
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:42,039
two weeks we were had our revenue was

1243
00:56:38,949 --> 00:56:46,750
generating and yeah we had issues you

1244
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:49,420
know as far as we did it and that's

1245
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:51,369
where I see this going in the future is

1246
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,700
tribes creating that tribal Network

1247
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:56,230
nation a nation trying to you know

1248
00:56:54,699 --> 00:56:58,000
support each other and help each other

1249
00:56:56,230 --> 00:57:01,300
with the process so that we're doing it

1250
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,239
all the right way I applaud the efforts

1251
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:08,380
of su naka on trying to have the tribes

1252
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:12,579
work together in a uniform and model

1253
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:15,130
ordinances and such in Sacramento tribes

1254
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:17,049
agree on very little they agree on

1255
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:20,650
sovereignty sovereignty is an

1256
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:22,330
overarching principle but in some of the

1257
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:24,930
bills Eve worked on which should not

1258
00:57:22,329 --> 00:57:28,179
have been controversial there has been

1259
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:31,239
one tribe is sponsoring a water bill for

1260
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:33,519
example making a a specific change and

1261
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:35,529
never try this concern about a precedent

1262
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:37,449
that could set or infringement on

1263
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:41,560
sovereignty or how it could go be

1264
00:57:37,449 --> 00:57:43,449
litigated out so well I applaud the

1265
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:45,549
efforts to bring people together Green

1266
00:57:43,449 --> 00:57:49,889
tribes together from what we've seen on

1267
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:54,700
the ground is there is a very fractious

1268
00:57:49,889 --> 00:57:58,119
and and not unified in opinions and so

1269
00:57:54,699 --> 00:58:02,409
if this can be a way for them to be

1270
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:05,460
alignment that would be applauded

1271
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:09,279
what are the implications for

1272
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:12,519
reservations that allow cannabis when

1273
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,080
they have a police department the tribal

1274
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:16,809
police departments where the tribal

1275
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:25,750
police officers have tools

1276
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:30,369
I was actually one of those federal

1277
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:32,920
agents when I worked so as I mentioned

1278
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:35,230
we consult 10 Isabelle consults for

1279
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,930
tribes we have our own Police Department

1280
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:40,840
they are not federally cross designated

1281
00:58:37,929 --> 00:58:45,759
it's not an issue for us our advice to

1282
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:48,640
tribes that have dual designated law

1283
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,010
enforcement officers that they preclude

1284
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:55,029
prohibit make sure that those officers

1285
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:57,910
do not have anything to do physically

1286
00:58:55,030 --> 00:59:00,310
with the cannabis enterprise so there

1287
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:03,099
isn't that conflict between enforcement

1288
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:04,949
of federal law and the tribes statutory

1289
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:08,589
authority to conduct cannabis business

1290
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:11,949
so our advice is the rest of the

1291
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:13,570
reservation not any patrols or respond

1292
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:17,439
to calls for services within that

1293
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:20,070
cannabis area what happens if one of

1294
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,539
your transporters gets pulled over

1295
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:24,750
California Highway Patrol been there

1296
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:24,750
done that

1297
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:31,990
there again and I'll answer the question

1298
00:59:29,619 --> 00:59:33,639
but just by way of instruction of where

1299
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:35,139
the state is at as I mentioned we have

1300
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:37,509
almost three years of experience

1301
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:39,730
regulating in this space I've made at

1302
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:41,440
least a half a dozen overtures to in

1303
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:44,170
person to the chief of the Bureau of

1304
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,570
cannabis Control Laurie Ajax who I knew

1305
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:48,280
when she was at ABC I said look you guys

1306
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:50,440
are just getting into this regulatory

1307
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,450
business come on down to Santa Isabel

1308
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,010
have a conversation with us because I

1309
00:59:52,449 --> 00:59:56,769
will tell you these cannabis operators

1310
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:59,080
you guys are really creative about

1311
00:59:56,769 --> 01:00:02,079
getting around the rules and finding

1312
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:05,079
those loopholes I'm writing regulation

1313
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:08,250
almost every day to plug up those that

1314
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:10,929
that innovation that you guys exhibit I

1315
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:11,650
have yet to have the state take me up

1316
01:00:10,929 --> 01:00:15,549
and come down

1317
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:19,030
although we have held classes we held a

1318
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:21,789
week-long class for cannabis tribal

1319
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:24,370
cannabis regulators we had a full room

1320
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:25,929
but no one from the state will come down

1321
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:28,150
and have a conversation with us about

1322
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:30,679
regulating the space which is kind of

1323
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:33,050
interesting the question was about

1324
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:34,969
exportation so we have a very thorough

1325
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:37,610
transportation permitting process

1326
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:41,509
without boring you it's about six seven

1327
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:43,820
pages long are and we have requirements

1328
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:45,970
with the driver requirements for the

1329
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:49,030
containers requirements for the vehicle

1330
01:00:45,969 --> 01:00:52,489
you know verification that the inventory

1331
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:55,550
the shipment reaches its destination we

1332
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:58,969
have had our transportations and I'm up

1333
01:00:55,550 --> 01:01:01,310
to sixteen sixteen thousand

1334
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:04,489
transportations a cannabis product from

1335
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:06,619
Santa Isabel in the past three years we

1336
01:01:04,489 --> 01:01:08,659
have been stopped by law enforcement CHP

1337
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:11,119
local law enforcement they show the

1338
01:01:08,659 --> 01:01:13,549
transportation permits every single case

1339
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,289
the officer said be on your way no

1340
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:17,630
issues with law enforcement whatsoever

1341
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:21,199
in the transportation of product all

1342
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:22,730
right so in closing I'm just gonna go

1343
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:25,309
down the line here and if you can just

1344
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:29,690
give us just just a brief statement

1345
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:33,710
about what the ideal policy would look

1346
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:35,210
like for Native American cannabis in the

1347
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:37,970
state of California

1348
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:40,340
what would facilitate a greater cannabis

1349
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:43,519
industry for Indian country and also

1350
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:45,410
appease the powers within the state

1351
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:47,360
government what does it look like what

1352
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:50,529
is your what is your wish list for this

1353
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:54,170
policy for this next legislative session

1354
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:58,460
were to be possible what would what

1355
01:01:54,170 --> 01:02:01,909
would you like to see I would like to

1356
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:04,429
see that legal pathway for tribes to be

1357
01:02:01,909 --> 01:02:09,049
able to enter into the legal cannabis

1358
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:11,809
market with us tribes you know mere in

1359
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:16,210
the state as close as we can be in

1360
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:18,639
respectful and of all of the regulations

1361
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:22,820
without having to waive our sovereignty

1362
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:24,859
number one to be able to create our own

1363
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:28,550
health care system for all Native

1364
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:31,280
American people in California and to be

1365
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:33,590
able to bring my tribe up to where we

1366
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,230
are self-sustaining where we don't have

1367
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:39,470
to rely on the federal government for

1368
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:40,150
anything ever except to have our you

1369
01:02:39,469 --> 01:02:43,659
know

1370
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:46,450
self-governance body and to be able to

1371
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:48,699
you know just live in harmony and do

1372
01:02:46,449 --> 01:02:51,848
what we do because we are creating a

1373
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:54,699
great product and you know we're doing

1374
01:02:51,849 --> 01:02:56,318
it just like all the other tribes want

1375
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:58,358
to do they want to get into this market

1376
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:05,349
and be self-sustaining and help their

1377
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:07,179
people create programs short and sweet

1378
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:09,700
for us the opportunity to play in a

1379
01:03:07,179 --> 01:03:12,879
level playing field and consistent

1380
01:03:09,699 --> 01:03:15,460
application of the rules whether it's on

1381
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,960
tribal lands or off tribal lands if you

1382
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:18,250
take a look at Sioux nacos website we

1383
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,230
have our guiding principles and our

1384
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:24,039
professional standards every one of the

1385
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:25,389
23 tribes of Seneca has committed to

1386
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:27,609
those guiding principles and

1387
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:30,278
professional standards tribes want to do

1388
01:03:27,608 --> 01:03:32,980
it right those that are serious about

1389
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:34,539
this business want to do it right and if

1390
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,949
we had that mutually respectful

1391
01:03:34,539 --> 01:03:40,028
relationship with the state of

1392
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:43,179
California and with operators off tribal

1393
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:45,699
lands then those few tribes that decide

1394
01:03:43,179 --> 01:03:47,288
they can make a quick buck because they

1395
01:03:45,699 --> 01:03:48,368
don't have to create all of the

1396
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:50,140
regulatory structure because

1397
01:03:48,369 --> 01:03:52,838
everything's on the reservation they'll

1398
01:03:50,139 --> 01:04:02,558
be outliers they'll be obvious and we'll

1399
01:03:52,838 --> 01:04:04,420
invite them out of this industry I said

1400
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,309
and I would just like to add that I

1401
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:12,240
think it would be really wonderful to

1402
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:16,690
see a line of products cultivated and

1403
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:18,818
manufactured on California tribal land

1404
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:20,588
we're doing you know we're creating

1405
01:04:18,818 --> 01:04:23,380
Appalachians for cannabis growing in

1406
01:04:20,588 --> 01:04:27,338
different areas in California and it

1407
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:31,450
would be really cool to see California

1408
01:04:27,338 --> 01:04:34,869
native trade association little like

1409
01:04:31,449 --> 01:04:39,189
brandings like little like stamps and a

1410
01:04:34,869 --> 01:04:41,170
very yeah a whole a whole line of

1411
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:57,889
products from

1412
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:59,570
tribal lands that would be really so you

1413
01:04:57,889 --> 01:05:01,909
know I understand the question Courtney

1414
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:05,030
I'm not going to answer the question I'm

1415
01:05:01,909 --> 01:05:07,489
going to say you know I'm not sure we

1416
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:09,769
talking really there right now there's

1417
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:12,469
language in the regulations that says

1418
01:05:09,769 --> 01:05:15,440
the tribes that businesses on tribal

1419
01:05:12,469 --> 01:05:18,049
land can apply for a state license there

1420
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,119
are the two biggest issues with that

1421
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:22,760
there's a number of issues for the two

1422
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:25,400
biggest issues with that language it is

1423
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:26,990
twofold first there's a waiver of

1424
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:31,690
sovereign immunity as previously

1425
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:34,279
referenced which goes too far which

1426
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:38,630
without consultation with tribes and

1427
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:41,360
which is asking for tribes to subsume

1428
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:43,490
themselves to cities to counties to the

1429
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:47,150
state of California and it's very

1430
01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:50,029
problematic and so while this is

1431
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:55,309
speaking individually completely for

1432
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:59,480
myself it needs to be clear that the

1433
01:05:55,309 --> 01:06:02,480
business as opposed to the tribe whether

1434
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:04,490
the business is waiving or choosing not

1435
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,250
to have a sovereign defense placed by

1436
01:06:04,489 --> 01:06:09,199
the business compared to the tribe as a

1437
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:11,210
whole and the tribes regulatory

1438
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:13,189
functions and the tribes land use

1439
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:16,070
Authority so there isn't that

1440
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:19,760
distinction drawn right now and that

1441
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:21,950
distinction could potentially in my own

1442
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,110
personal view potentially alleviate some

1443
01:06:21,949 --> 01:06:26,750
of the conversations and concerns I

1444
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:31,250
don't have to be the case but that's one

1445
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:34,070
thing the second thing is this right now

1446
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:36,170
the state only the state recognizes

1447
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:38,720
cities and counties as local governments

1448
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:42,500
the language in the regulations

1449
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:45,439
essentially say if you want a tribal a

1450
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:48,199
license in the state for cannabis on

1451
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:51,869
tribal land you need city or county

1452
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:55,379
approval for whatever surrounds that try

1453
01:06:51,869 --> 01:06:58,469
those counties do not have Sony approval

1454
01:06:55,380 --> 01:07:01,440
or land use approval on the tribes but

1455
01:06:58,469 --> 01:07:03,689
the state is asking them to regulate and

1456
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,630
to have that authority which they do not

1457
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:09,960
have if they try to do that they would

1458
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:11,820
lose in court because it violates you

1459
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,550
know if that violence the sovereignty

1460
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:17,250
local controlled land use control of the

1461
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:19,410
tribes in a ridiculous fashion so what

1462
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:21,690
I'd like to do when I'm working on

1463
01:07:19,409 --> 01:07:24,539
trying to do and explain to the

1464
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:26,460
regulators and those above them just

1465
01:07:24,539 --> 01:07:31,019
they thought they made a system that

1466
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:32,909
works but it stinks it stinks because it

1467
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:35,929
doesn't respect viable land use

1468
01:07:32,909 --> 01:07:38,129
authority and asks for an overly broad

1469
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:41,399
waiver of sovereign immunity that

1470
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:46,140
doesn't focus on the business aspects

1471
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:48,059
itself versus the tribe as a whole I'm

1472
01:07:46,139 --> 01:07:51,569
just gonna piggyback off that and say

1473
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:54,269
that yeah absolutely the tribe should

1474
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:57,090
have should have the ability to retain

1475
01:07:54,269 --> 01:08:00,809
civil regulatory jurisdiction and and

1476
01:07:57,090 --> 01:08:02,400
and regulate cannabis we have seen with

1477
01:08:00,809 --> 01:08:04,259
one of the tribes that we're working

1478
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:06,750
with the surrounding County bans

1479
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:10,170
cannabis when we went into Polk with the

1480
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:13,110
state the CDFA actually about whether or

1481
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:15,030
what what impact that may have because

1482
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:16,770
from our perspective the tribe of course

1483
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:19,800
it doesn't matter that the county

1484
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:22,230
surrounding it bans cannabis they have

1485
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:24,329
no jurisdiction on tribal land we were

1486
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:26,489
finally able to get some reasonableness

1487
01:08:24,329 --> 01:08:28,769
since well established law says that

1488
01:08:26,489 --> 01:08:31,710
counties have no jurisdiction on tribal

1489
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:34,500
land so we are seeing some level of oh

1490
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:40,680
hello awake and education around this

1491
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:41,970
issue so I hope I hope that that you you

1492
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,170
won't have to come up against that

1493
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:50,180
because we've had that fight a little

1494
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:50,180
bit so let's talk okay thank you

1495
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:58,859
with that I will thank our panelists

1496
01:08:56,368 --> 01:09:01,380
each and every one of you I know that

1497
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:05,410
you probably and gone through eight

1498
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:11,630
plates to be here so thank you very much
