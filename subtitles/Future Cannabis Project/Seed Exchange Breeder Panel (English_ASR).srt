101
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,039
this is like the true future of all this

102
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,438
it's like going back in time you know

103
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,759
it's like let's make this happen like it

104
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,759
once did again

105
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,560
regardless

106
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,639
and i feel like it's a timeless act so

107
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,959
you know we gather we share seeds we

108
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,878
work we we get to be around the people

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,680
who have put a lot of time and energy

110
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,319
into their seeds and and and that needs

111
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,639
to keep happening in our in our planet

112
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,519
in order for us to really fully awaken

113
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,240
into

114
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,959
uh this next coming age uh which is an

115
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,478
age of golden light and

116
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,879
you know that age of gold and light and

117
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,800
consciousness is real so

118
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,800
you know i just want people to

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,879
i've been trying to give people as many

120
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
people some of that weed that i i grew

121
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,159
just a smoke during

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,079
the time while we're all listening so we

123
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,520
can receive that energy

124
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,680
um

125
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:52,079
and so let's get let's get into it uh

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
i'm gonna i'm gonna let each one of the

127
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,800
breeders here just kind of talk about

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,478
themselves a little bit um

129
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,919
and i want you to just kind of introduce

130
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,680
yourself

131
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,439
but

132
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,120
i want

133
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,680
i want to know

134
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,959
your relationship to the breeding and to

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,439
genetics

136
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,758
and and what inspires you

137
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,719
and what has inspired you in in that

138
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,960
realm

139
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,639
um and where it kind of started and and

140
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,478
i know it can get long-winded so let's

141
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,319
just keep track of time but just try to

142
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,560
pick out some nuggets of things that

143
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,399
have really helped guide you further

144
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,560
into the process

145
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,719
so let's start maybe

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,800
on one end and work down the line just

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,800
for easy sake

148
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
so jesse

149
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,879
what's the inspiration

150
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,370
come up or do you move in the microphone

151
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,439
let's do that oh wow

152
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,319
[Laughter]

153
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,319
stand and deliver

154
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,199
can we hear it for nick that was

155
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,600
freaking amazing like

156
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,400
it's a real shit

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,240
mix a little stand-up comedy and like

158
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,239
brought everyone in and all of the seeds

159
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,639
and those seeds will do a lot of stuff

160
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,560
it makes me think of the original uh

161
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,840
living soil symposium and the seeds that

162
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,399
went out there

163
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,159
and like seeing that stuff today still

164
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,638
in all the different ways that

165
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,160
it's been worked on so

166
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,960
i don't know i think it's real beautiful

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,439
the

168
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,918
sharing of seeds in the way that we

169
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,038
it brings us together and we get to like

170
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,359
exchange

171
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,519
a relation around a relationship with

172
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,479
nature observing a plant

173
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,399
and i think um

174
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,318
from the moment i first like

175
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,719
found cannabis seeds and weed like i was

176
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,720
immediately fascinated immediately grew

177
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,720
them brought them out in the woods

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,479
fascinated about the plant in every way

179
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
and then that fast made me fascinate

180
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,800
about nature in every way and science

181
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
and art and

182
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,478
mutualistic relationships all the ways

183
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,478
that those work and how those actually

184
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,279
can apply to everything

185
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,279
in

186
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,079
nature but also everything in our own

187
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,799
constructs in that's the way we should

188
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,758
be working for economy and for the way

189
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,199
that we interact in business and friends

190
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,080
and events like this i think are an

191
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,598
amazing example of that potential so

192
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,199
yeah hear it let's hear it for this

193
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,959
event thank you guys

194
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,199
really special

195
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,198
because this is what it was and it's you

196
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
know it feels good the weather blessed

197
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,478
us

198
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,240
um yeah it just

199
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,758
this is the type of exchange this is the

200
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,160
type of thing we've been hungry for in

201
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,000
very much the last two years for sure

202
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,319
but honestly before those two years it

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,360
already kind of got fucked and we didn't

204
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,879
even have shit like this before kovid so

205
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,120
i don't know it's a it's definitely a

206
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,839
very cathartic feeling to just be here

207
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,519
and um experience all this with you and

208
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,719
celebrate the plants and friendship and

209
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,719
community um

210
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,759
i started a project called biovortex

211
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,000
a while ago um

212
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,479
around the idea of

213
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,399
influencing cannabis industry in a more

214
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,159
environmentally thoughtful direction

215
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,038
and mutualism in general in the way that

216
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,800
we interact with each other and the

217
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,159
breeding has been part of that but so

218
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,038
has the

219
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,960
um social media as the photography the

220
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,878
art projects the movie projects that

221
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,799
we're doing now all kinds of different

222
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,560
aspects and then the talks and events

223
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,960

226
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
practices and the farms and getting to

227
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,360

229
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,879
the different talks that got to connect

230
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,278
cannabis community to the practices that

231
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,599
mattered and that also built this kind

232
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,679

need you know for you know we all know

316
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,600
what's going on in the industry and

317
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,639
you know it is what it is the plant is

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,240
kind of uh in control of this whole

319
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,240
paradigm you know

320
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,320
it's not about money or anything it's

321
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,039
really just about the plant

322
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,440
you know and and so

323
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,199
it's there's a lot going on and you know

324
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,040
i i think that

325
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,120
as long as we you know obviously it's

326
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,278
bringing us together as much as

327
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,519
you know i think we can all say that

328
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,480
maybe we feel a little bit detached you

329
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,440
know honestly because i know i do

330
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,680
um

331
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,360
i am right here with everybody you know

332
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,439
but at the same time i feel i don't know

333
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,759
if it was just me but i feel like

334
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,320
there's this detachment going on and so

335
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,958
by all of us coming together

336
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,560
it's really crucial you know especially

337
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,399
right now because i know we're all

338
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,719
feeling it i know i'm feeling it i know

339
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,399
everybody else is feeling it so just

340
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,759
really thankful that we're all showing

341
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,679
up for each other

342
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,600
um you know

343
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,439
you know just like you're all about like

344
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,600
my favorite people in the world right

345
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,720
here you know i just love you all

346
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,800
and just uh been doing my thing up on

347
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,800
the hill y'all probably see me doing

348
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,759
what i do and you know i just do what i

349
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,519
do

350
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,480
make no claims

351
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,039
i come from no educational background

352
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,200
i'm just a practical guy who you know

353
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,039
just listens to the plants and do what

354
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,639
i'm told they just tell me what to do i

355
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,360
just do what they want me to do that's

356
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,600
all i need to know it doesn't matter if

357
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,200
it doesn't matter what what you think

358
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,278
and that's kind of the whole

359
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,720
part of my whole methodology is just the

360
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,879
trust you know

361
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,160
um just trusting the plan trusting the

362
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,679
process

363
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,519
you know kind of like an onion you're

364
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,439
just peeling back the layers the more

365
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,200
you peel back the layers the more you

366
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,519
trust it and the more

367
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,120
the more is revealed over time so i

368
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,720
think that's just the

369
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,560
you know because like there's a lot of

370
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,240
you know there's like the the bro

371
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,000
science that people like the science

372
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,159
world it's like oh if you don't test

373
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,759
stuff you're a bro science you know like

374
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,120
you know what i mean nick like if you

375
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,519
don't test something you're you're

376
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,360
automatically you know like you don't

377
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,360
know what's going on like you don't need

378
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,480
to know because if you're following the

379
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,480
methodolo methodology of nature

380
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
nature's taking care of everything

381
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,800
because nature is the most intelligent

382
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,720
system on earth so we don't really need

383
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,399
to know you know i think it's good to

384
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,399
know so you have that relationship with

385
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,559
your soil but once you get that base of

386
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,039
your understanding and relationship with

387
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,000
your soil then you know

388
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,599
you can kind of just go from there and

389
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,639
you know i don't know it's just

390
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,639
i don't know just something i've been

391
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,799
thinking about a lot you know just it's

392
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,120
just like this you know within the

393
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,799
industry how you know people are if you

394
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,039
know just the different sides of the

395
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,039
coin of the science side to you know

396
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,719
like me and nick or just like on our own

397
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,319
little world you know

398
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,160
and like you know a bunch of other you

399
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,680
know farmers we just kind of like do our

400
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,039
thing and listen to the plants do what

401
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,799
we're told

402
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,879
you know but you know then there's the

403
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,958
the side of the coin where you have to

404
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,639
test everything and it's all like that

405
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,759
and you know i think it's and ultimately

406
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,198
everybody's just looking for that

407
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,198
balance you know

408
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,120
so i think it's just what we're looking

409
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,039
for everybody's looking for balance

410
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,799
whatever it is whatever you're trying to

411
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,120
do i think we're just all looking for

412
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,719
the same thing which is balanced so

413
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
i don't know yeah i've been doing my

414
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
breeding project which is just like i'm

415
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,440
just breeding for like this head change

416
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,278
that i

417
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,199
am experiencing

418
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:15,838
um which was this uh dog shit seeds

419
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,240
bag seed that i started uh just kind of

420
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,639
a long story i won't get into it all

421
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,799
but yeah i've just been kind of which

422
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,278
turned out to be i was breeding for a

423
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,120
high cbga and didn't know it

424
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,198
until i started testing

425
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,360
and then went back and

426
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,758
went through all of my previous tests

427
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,680
and i found they were all high in cbga

428
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,919
and so i've realized that's what i was

429
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,319
breeding for so that's kind of like my

430
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,838
breeding project is like a high cbga

431
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,199
breeding project

432
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,279
which is the precursor to all

433
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,559
cannabinoids so you know it's kind of

434
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,439
significant

435
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,439
um

436
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,199
so that's something that's cool that

437
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,639
i've been working on but

438
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,519

mountain farm uh prideline seeds and i

445
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,879
think kind of what like jessie was

446
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,440
saying uh cannabis was my gateway plant

447
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,198
um it was the first plant i grew

448
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,440
uh and my older brother isn't here to

449
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,799
confirm anymore but he had like house

450
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,920
plants in like middle school but he

451
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,198
could have been growing weed then too

452
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,879
probably but

453
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,719
yeah i started out growing cannabis and

454
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,159
now i have you know cactuses in my

455
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,680
greenhouse you know i'm like taking

456
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,600
cuttings from people's houses of their

457
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,638
house plants and i'm obsessed with

458
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,920
plants

459
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,360
and uh

460
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,039
so i'm thankful for that and for this

461
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,079
community and

462

a long time i even went down to help her

466
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,518

470
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,719
story window like okay i see why yeah

471
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,560
[Laughter]

472
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,240
uh you know my one of my favorite

473
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,558
stories from my dad he was saving

474
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,720
backseat for like a decade you know

475
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,318
before he popped his first seeds in 76

476
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,919
and it was like you know mexican south

477
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,359
american

478
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,079
they acclimated that to the hills in

479
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,599
northern california

480
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,359
and then some indica came in from

481
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,838
afghanistan that grew that they crossed

482
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,000
those together groomed for decades and

483
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,198
then i came on to the scene my older

484
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,558
brother a lot younger i think he was

485
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,079
like 10 or 11 helping my dad in the

486
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,160
garden and he looked at me and said you

487
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,960
know you need to go to school i got one

488
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,480
kid growing and weight do something else

489
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,038
with your life and now i'm running the

490
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
family farm and he's pretty happy

491
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,879
he wanted me to be more than just an

492
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,120
outlaw which i get and now i'm more than

493
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,280

494
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:49,119

saying like we learned the heart first

501
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,439
we were plant whisperers first and now

502
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,440
we're like okay what does failule mean i

503
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,600
better look that up from webster's okay

504
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,759
like you know so we're learning the

505
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,678
science

506
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,919
um where we need to

507
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,559
and it's it's fun and we're all very

508
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,840
passionate about what we do and

509
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,839
it's great to be up here with these guys

510
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,400
hey i'm josh from moongazer farms

511
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,440
just gotta give a huge

512
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,240
love and gratitude to joey and tamara

513
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,840
this is amazing

514
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
you guys are amazing

515
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,399
uh this is like how things used to be

516
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,160
and i'm getting a lot of good feeling

517
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,960
from how that all was and thank you all

518
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,160
for coming um but basically pretty much

519
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,960
uh

520
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,720
my wife sandra and i uh we have a couple

521
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,000
kids twins and we're just trying to make

522
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,720
it as illegal

523
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,038
as a you know wreck farm

524
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,319
back when we met nick and jesse and

525
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,879
everyone things were starting to get

526
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,000
legal we kind of jumped into it and

527
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,760
uh

528
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,519
people were telling us to grow clones

529
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,839
and have everything be all uniform and

530
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,240
everything and we just always wanted to

531
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,959
stick with the seeds and

532
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,400
do our breeding and it's uh

533
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,240
finally gotten you know it's gotten us

534
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
to a point now where it's like you just

535
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,720
gotta have like triple a

536
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,840
herb right now and it's gotta you know

537
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,360
it's like

538
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,918
it's gotta be good

539
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,759
and and growing from seeds you know

540
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,160
we're able to achieve that even though

541
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,480
we have different phenotypes

542
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,519
and you know things don't have to be

543
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,480
like super duper uniform all the time

544
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,400
um so it's you know yeah so you know

545
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
seeds like just for so many reasons i

546
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,840
mean i mean even our own kids like

547
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,679
they're you know we

548
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,119
they're different phenotypes but people

549
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,919
think they're identical people think

550
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,678
they're identical all the time

551
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,038
but we see their subtle differences and

552
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,240
we love their subtle differences

553
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,919
and so that's sort of how i approach the

554
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,000
cannabis

555
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,120
and how a lot of us here approach the

556
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
cannabis

557
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,038
um

558
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,159
and and and it's just kind of been

559
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,720
if you want a truly sun-grown product uh

560
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,799
which we do that's what we like to smoke

561
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,480
uh it's sort of

562
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,558
planted in the spring

563
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,079
on the when the moon is a specific when

564
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:28,158
the moon is in a certain uh phase and

565
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,000
we harvest it in the fall um when the

566
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,559
moon's in a certain phase

567
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,720
and uh you know when you're growing from

568
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,519
clones clones are wonderful and they've

569
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,159
been crucial for this plant of course

570
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,759
uh in its evolution but at this point

571
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,360
for us when we're when we're out in the

572
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,480
light and we're doing it out we're doing

573
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,240
it this way

574
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,599
um you know that's

575
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,519
that's how we want to smoke that's what

576
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,119
we want to provide for people and so

577
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,200
that's how we're doing it is just from

578
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,798
seed planted in the spring harvested in

579
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,558
the fall and

580
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,480
of course planted among lots of other

581
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,000
beautiful plants so we don't have to

582
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,329
spray anything

583
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,660
and that's what we do

584
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:08,659
[Applause]

585
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,240
hello hello okay i think this just got a

586
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,320
loose uh thing so we got to be careful

587
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,919
when we're holding it but i just rather

588
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,200
sit down and kind of not do the whole

589
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,080
thing

590
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,000
in that way um

591
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,279
and then i'll just pass this around but

592
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,839
i'm just gonna kind of bring up some

593
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,839
topics

594
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,798
back on okay we're back on

595
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,839
all right uh

596
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,158
so

597
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,839
i want to i want to get into some um

598
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,559
just kind of i want to dig into some

599
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,959
breeding a little bit uh i'm pretty

600
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,960
passionate about it you know my

601
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,360
evolution with breeding seeds has

602
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,038
evolved rapidly in

603
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,959
and i haven't been doing it as long as

604
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:40,079
everybody uh

605
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,319
but i've been committed to it uh very

606
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,000
pretty seriously and

607
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,240
been paying really close attention to a

608
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,159
whole bunch of different lines and and

609
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,679
working lines but

610
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,440
my question is uh

611
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,759
out of all the seeds

612
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,600
that you like to grow

613
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,240
and if we can think of seeds in

614
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,759
different categories such as

615
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,359
f1

616
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,759
ibl

617
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,240
poly hybrid

618
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,599
specific traits within genetics that you

619
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,880
might like

620
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,359
uh

621
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,559
but what type of seeds are your

622
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,599
preference for growing

623
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,038
for you

624
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,480
not

625
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,319
not for

626
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,120
what the market wants because if we're

627
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,000
all all breeders have to do a certain

628
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,439
amount of work uh for the market but

629
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,759
also then there's a certain amount of

630
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,679
soul work that goes on in breeding and

631
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,879
so i want to pull some of the soul out

632
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,559
of you guys

633
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,200
and just like

634
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:42,000
hear what your favorite types of seeds

635
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,440
to pop right now are and interpret that

636
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,400
the way you will if it's from your own

637
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,240
stock if it's just whatever but

638
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,679
if anybody wants to volunteer to take

639
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,200
that one on first let's go down the line

640
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,600
go down the line again it's nice and

641
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,600
easy with the mic

642
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,839
i guess

643
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,400
what i most want to grow is what i find

644
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:23,278
interesting and

645
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,559
that's a little bit rough um

646
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,798
yeah it's what

647
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,240
what i get to learn from what

648
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,918
things that i find interesting that's

649
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,599
that's what i want to keep sprouting the

650
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,759
things that i have

651
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,599
in my head what i want to see

652
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,278
what i want to see other people

653
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,719
grow and what i want to see come from

654
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:43,679
that it's all like very interesting

655
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,960
like possibilities that go out and you

656
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,960
know what what else will come from this

657
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,720
seed um

658
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,640
if you turn your body a little bit you

659
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,640
won't forget the there will be a meet up

660
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,440
block your back

661
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,400
the speaker's right here so that

662
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,400
actually works better

663
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,278
um

664
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,960
so to be able to

665
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,278
see the outcome

666
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,400
of something on a farm too in different

667
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:16,159
locations also really interests me

668
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,600
and

669
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,278
doing that around hash is really

670
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,918
interesting to be able to see

671
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:24,558
how hash comes out how that yields and

672
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,559
to see that on different farms and

673
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,558
different plants isolated and then the

674
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,759
idea of reading with them

675
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,599
but

676
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,879
some of the like really

677
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:37,439
joyful things are growing like true

678
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,320
primordial varieties and land races and

679
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,759
seeing

680
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,798
all the lessons that they like kind of

681
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,960
have

682
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,319
in there and really observing the plant

683
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,759
in those forms

684
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:50,720
the lab um from

685
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:53,679
the razon indian land rice seed exchange

686
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:58,400
he had got these low lab valley

687
00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:01,278
uh seeds which is like 7 000 feet up in

688
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,278
cashmere and in an area growing in the

689
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,640
trees and in the hills where

690
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,159
it didn't have any other

691
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,400
cross-pollination there's no light

692
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,159
pollution so it's not really affected by

693
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,240
human encroachment and it actually is a

694
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,080
primordial variety that's just been

695
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,679
growing in the trees and it was really

696
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,439
interesting to see

697
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,278
all the things that were already there

698
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,798
and this thing this plant that's been

699
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,038
growing in the same way for thousands of

700
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:26,798
years in the same location without other

701
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:29,359
things messing with it and it was very

702
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,918
they were yeah very adaptive very smart

703
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,918
they're kind of like

704
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,480
the wolves of

705
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:38,400
a cannabis plant and the fact that

706
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,720
they're like just adapted to survive in

707
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,278
this place and not domesticated when we

708
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,240
start to do domestication process like

709
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,798
instant

710
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,798
morphology changes happen so like if

711
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,440
you're picking your favorite plant and

712
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,599
smelling those flowers and then or

713
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,720
seeing how well it hashes or something

714
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,399
those seeds are the ones that are

715
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,200
actually inside

716
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,080
the the flower and just hidden in that

717
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,000
brax a little closer to the the actual

718
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,158
stem and inside and so

719
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,400
those ones they don't like fly out that

720
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,919
easy and they get bigger and instantly

721
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,600
you start domesticating the seeds get

722
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,320
plumper and bigger these seeds are

723
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,558
incredibly small and very thin and ready

724
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,639
to like fly out so like

725
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,480
when breeding with it like i had to be

726
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,679
really careful to like put a bag around

727
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,919
it before cutting it because the seeds

728
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,600
would all just start flying you know and

729
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,960
that's like a scattering too the wind

730
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,038
would come by and they would actually go

731
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,880
pretty far it was just like ready to

732
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:31,759
shoot out and it's like oh yeah you know

733
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,440
like

734
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,359
the only reason why they'd stay in is

735
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,038
because that was like an interaction

736
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,038
with humans and like picking the thing

737
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,480
that you so those are the ones that keep

738
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,000
getting passed on it's like the one in

739
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,919
your favorite flower if you're actually

740
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,319
choosing that kind of selected

741
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,520
process it's just kind of interesting to

742
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:52,000
think about

743
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,000
all the lessons something old show us

744
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,640
the adaptive aspect of it too as far as

745
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,720
being able to watch it and interact with

746
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,640
the sun in its environment or them i

747
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,798
don't want to say it it's not like the

748
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,559
right word when referring to a plant but

749
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,398
um

750
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,480
you know they i was growing both male

751
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,639
and females and we should have better

752
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,319
words i guess but they were they were

753
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,000
tracking the sun so perfectly before it

754
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,278
rose you know like and i actually did

755
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,319
night vision

756
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:24,398
uh uh time lapse photos of them to watch

757
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,678
this dance that they do each day and

758
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,759
they would just like set up so good like

759
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,919
just stretching like straight yoga ready

760
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,440
for the sun and got every bit of that

761
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,360
perfect like light

762
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,200
in the beginning and then would kind of

763
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:38,879
track and then at night they would fall

764
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,480
down so far

765
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,320
just completely

766
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,360
like hold everything in and go through

767
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,119
this whole

768
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,759
breath um

769
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,319
and yeah it was just interesting like

770
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,720
how fast they grew and how

771
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,759
small and slow they grew at first too

772
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,120
all the seeds were um

773
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,119
they're just so small and they take so

774
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,199
long to germinate and and are are

775
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,639
difficult to germinate and i was

776
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,558
thinking about well that makes a ton of

777
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,120
sense because if all of a sudden they're

778
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:10,000
scattering and then the snow comes down

779
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,798
or like it rains right before the winter

780
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,679
every plant that germinates just dies

781
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:17,759
seven thousand feet up or so and so they

782
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,200
have to really be smart enough to know

783
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,519
hey are these conditions really right

784
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,960
you know like okay yeah it's wet maybe

785
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,879
it's warm enough but is it warm enough

786
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,679
for enough period of time for us to

787
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,799
really

788
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,880
be like

789
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,879
okay cool let's crack we're gonna we're

790
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,440
gonna have a successful season and not

791
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,600
immediately die by like some big storm

792
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,038
and uh yeah then they seem to like show

793
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,038
that too they're very careful there's

794
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,839
like okay is this it and they they they

795
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,480
crack so slowly the germination and just

796
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,720
that root radical is just so small and

797
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,360
coming out the tiniest little sprouts

798
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,679
but then they grow really really fast um

799
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,639
and take take advantage of whatever they

800
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,720
have and that might be um but if they

801
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,320
don't have much they'll conserve too so

802
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,399
they they can kind of they're very

803
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,359
adaptive in figuring that kind of stuff

804
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,398
out

805
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,479
but

806
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,158
um yeah the things that are are

807
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,798
fascinating are interesting that connect

808
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,880
to something old and get me thinking and

809
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:12,639
whether that's for making something that

810
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,399
makes a farmer more successful in what

811
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,799
they're doing you know i like

812
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,558
mold resistance i like having stuff that

813
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,519
flowers at certain times certain terpene

814
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:24,079
profiles certain hash yielding just

815
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,000
profiles in the flowers and look all the

816
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,319
things and like figuring out what works

817
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,159
for someone and that's a constant puzzle

818
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,798
and fascination too so

819
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,799
the things that are interesting

820
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:41,278
[Applause]

821
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,679
that's so

822
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:46,640
i want to thank jesse because he

823
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,720
shared his genetics with me and

824
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,799
um have just made

825
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,399
new genetics now that are like

826
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,200
substantially

827
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,879
better mold resistance and

828
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,640
you know

829
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,360
crystal content

830
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,679
um because he has a lot of hash strains

831
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,158
um so i bred that with a lot of my

832
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,320
different velvet perps crosses

833
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,760
um so now they're like

834
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:16,158
they seem super charged but uh

835
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,079
i started growing like little plants in

836
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,120
the bushes like guerrilla status you

837
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,038
know

838
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,798
i'm sure a lot of people have done that

839
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:26,640
before but uh

840
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:29,119
i was always uh fascinated with like

841
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,320
you know throwing pollen on i would have

842
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,119
to like

843
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:35,759
walk two miles and i had a couple little

844
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,839
male plants in a in a little creek a

845
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,720
little spring bed you know and i would

846
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:43,119
take the pollen and throw it on my best

847
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,399
my you know one of the best plants

848
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:48,879
and you know just to see the diversity

849
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,398
of what comes out of

850
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,000
you know just throwing a little bit of

851
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:53,759
pollen on

852
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,679
and uh seeing you know the different

853
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,359
phenotypes that come out it's just it's

854
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,960
kind of like a pandora's box you never

855
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,319
know what you're gonna get so that

856
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,319
really like you know

857
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,080
got me into breeding you know

858
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:11,119
so about 10 years ago i really started

859
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:13,278
to do it each year

860
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:16,158
making my own seeds and then growing

861
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,839
them and then selecting the best ones

862
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,360
you know that i liked and throwing more

863
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,158
pollen on them

864
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:21,759
um

865
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,960
and

866
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:26,240
it's

867
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,240
you know it's just like a

868
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,600
it's a good thing to do

869
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:30,639
you know

870
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,990
yeah

871
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,200
it really it makes me happy

872
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,720
[Laughter]

873
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,480
and uh you know

874
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,558
yeah keep on doing it yeah uh

875
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,679
now it's like that

876
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,678
everything's changed into you know like

877
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,840
you have to have the best stuff to even

878
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,000
just get it on the market to maybe sell

879
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,759
it for a decent price possibly i don't

880
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
know not anymore

881
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,720
maybe hopefully in the future you know

882
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,200
but uh you know

883
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,558
we can just keep crossing our varieties

884
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,720
together

885
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:07,720
and who knows what we'll come up with

886
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,720
so

887
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,360
i'm going to jump in because i'm right

888
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,278
here in line i just want to share what

889
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,879
i'm working on as well or what is

890
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,839
exciting right now

891
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,519
um

892
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,278
but when i think of breeding seeds i

893
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,120
mean that's the piece that

894
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,079
i'm most excited about which is funny

895
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,759
because that doesn't mix as well as a

896
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:31,519
commercial production farmer which i

897
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,038
have to rely on

898
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,240
but

899
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,798
i love

900
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,440
breeding so much that i just do it and

901
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:42,558
my favorite thing lately has been doing

902
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,480
as many inbred lines as i can as many

903
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,398
populations of those inbred lines as i

904
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,798
can in small rows within a greenhouse

905
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:51,199
high population counts and making

906
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:53,119
selections within those inbred lines and

907
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,120
furthering each inbred line but also

908
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,119
they're all there set up stacked on one

909
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,398
another to make real f ones if all of

910
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,398
the lines that you're putting in your

911
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:03,038
breeding hoop are inbred so you're

912
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:06,158
making more ibl's and you're making more

913
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:08,398
f1 stock and f1 stock is what you want

914
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,320
to have if you're growing production

915
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,078
which i have to do and i have to depend

916
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,480
on that so i've had to go through that

917
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,480
testing process but the truth is there

918
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,800
aren't really real f1s out there right

919
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,039
now because we're all still so immature

920
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,159
in our breeding uh you know

921
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:27,039
there are some you know deeper f we're

922
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,519
getting further but really uh standard

923
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:32,000
in breeding for isolating traits and

924
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,320
characteristics is like more than ten

925
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,480
generations so you know when that's the

926
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,800
case we just have to be realistic but i

927
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,039
just say keep going down the lines keep

928
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,519
inbreeding but also keep crossing those

929
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:46,079
inbred lines to make those f1s and

930
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,159
explore that because the hybrid vigor is

931
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,240
definitely something to understand when

932
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,200
you're growing for production

933
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,118
so

934
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,039
the breeding is the most exciting thing

935
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,720
for me and i just go kind of a little

936
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:00,480
overboard with

937
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,480
uh inbred line collections but

938
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,880
what what nick just said

939
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,779
yeah what he just said

940
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,838
basically well said

941
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,519
[Laughter]

942
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,599
but yeah um

943
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,159
there's a bunch of things in there like

944
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,320
what you're saying how it's it's hard to

945
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,759
do that in in a commercial space that

946
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,559
you're trying to run for production and

947
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,119
that's what i've been doing for years is

948
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,440
breeding and doing production so running

949
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,400
a research facility and a production

950
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,440
facility in one space which is really

951
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,160
crazy

952
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,079
because you there's a lot of room for

953
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:39,118
i mean there's no room for error you

954
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,280
know uh so you really have to be like

955
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,079
extra on your shit

956
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,680
you cannot slack for one second because

957
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,599
you just you're working with a lot of

958
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:50,159
different lines so

959
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,000
plus it's just you know uh

960
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,399
yeah it's just hard to really you know

961
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,400
pop enough seeds and and have the square

962
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,358
footage to make those selections so i'm

963
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,559
kind of

964
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:03,358
actually kind of phased out of

965
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,440
um doing my breeding projects for right

966
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,119
now and just holding on to my seed stock

967
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,039
just because

968
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,800
it's it's i'm trying to just stay you

969
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,039
know we you know shit's kind of falling

970
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,960
apart right so i'm just trying to stay

971
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,039
in my lane and that's that's okay you

972
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,639
know so i'm not trying to do too much

973
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,800
which is you know it's okay you know

974
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,480
i've been so yeah i was running these uh

975
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,599
inbred lines i've been running this

976
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,639
these dogs i'm calling it the dog pound

977
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,039
which uh you know from my uh dog uh my

978
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:35,519
my dog originally was like dog shit bag

979
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:37,838
seed and then um this um uh super silver

980
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,320
haze uh male

981
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:43,440
um so you know we just started running a

982
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,920
bunch of lines off of that dog shit so i

983
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,880
really like the dog shit terps

984
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,200
i just literally i just love it

985
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,440
i don't a lot it was a hard sell because

986
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,279
of the name you know obviously

987
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,358
so you know but

988
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,440
so that's you know so then that that's

989
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,920
how kind of the dog star came up once it

990
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,639
went into the super silver you know we

991
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,159
we called it dog star you know which was

992
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:10,639
you know um like like serious a you know

993
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,480
the origins of cannabis um that whole

994
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,559
story i'm not gonna get into all that

995
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,320
but you know that's kind of like you

996
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,039
know paying homage to

997
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,519
to the origins of cannabis and that

998
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,119
whole thing and the fact that you know

999
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,880
kind of you know

1000
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,640
that we ended up finding uh the high

1001
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,160
cbga

1002
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,519
which is the precursor to all

1003
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,920
cannabinoids

1004
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,079
you know that was pretty appropriate for

1005
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,000
you know calling it dog star i felt you

1006
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,640
know to you know because it was it was

1007
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,519
something special like you know over

1008
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:44,239
three percent um cbga

1009
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,838
at full term like like full term harp

1010
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,239
you know full term

1011
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,799
three months later testing it it's over

1012
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,759
three percent three four percent cbj

1013
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,920
which was

1014
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,480
you know which is one of the first uh

1015
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,358
cannabinoids that you know deteriorates

1016
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,240
you know and and so or it's really hard

1017
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,519
to get high you know to isolate the cbga

1018
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,959
apparently which i didn't know at the

1019
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:09,679
time so you know once we found that out

1020
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,679
um we just started uh working with that

1021
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,159
a little more intentionally you know and

1022
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,319
that was kind of like that was that head

1023
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:18,719
change that i was chasing kind of like a

1024
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,960
cbd you know we all know what that's

1025
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,719
like you know but the cbga

1026
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,639
it's kind of it's similar but it's got

1027
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,679
like that different head change but it's

1028
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,319
similar

1029
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,759
you know and and it's really hard to put

1030
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,960
your finger on you know what i mean

1031
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,800
because

1032
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,480
you know it just is so

1033
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,160
um that's you know so that was really

1034
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,679
exciting for me because that's what i

1035
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,838
was doing and that's kind of like my

1036
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,358
story so that was really exciting as far

1037
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,119
as what i would like to work with i'd

1038
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:44,239
like to work with everyone else's stuff

1039
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,559
but

1040
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:49,358
i i don't quite have like the space to

1041
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,519
to pop everybody's in label at all and

1042
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,199
and and you know but i would love to so

1043
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:54,559
i really you know and if somebody's

1044
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,118
gonna give me something to work with i

1045
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,000
kind of need like a hundred of any one

1046
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,880
you know

1047
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,119
you know seed to just to pop because

1048
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,039
like 10 is just like what am i doing

1049
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,480
with that you know i'm like

1050
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:07,838
where what i i don't have you know i'm

1051
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,000

know headset you know just you know i'm

1053
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,199
trying to you know on a commercial

1054
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:14,559
facility you have to have more of a

1055
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,879
direction so

1056
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,799
but we just don't have the my county

1057
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,440
whatever so we're just uh we're just

1058
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,359
staying in our lane for right now um you

1059
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,519
know which is cool

1060
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:27,440
so anyway that's been uh it's been good

1061
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,679
but you know i'll get back into uh

1062
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,000
messing with uh popping a bunch of seeds

1063
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,759
and looking for different lines and you

1064
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,880
know i'll get back into that in a minute

1065
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,400
now but

1066
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,680
for right now i've just been trying to

1067
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,680
like you know

1068
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:41,919
um hold the line

1069
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,159
you know just survive for a minute but

1070
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,320
um yeah yeah i just like to i would love

1071
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:47,279

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
really

1073
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,400
but yeah kind of like what nick is

1074
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,239
saying it's just like that's what i've

1075
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,400
been run you know just

1076
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,559
doing that for a long time and

1077
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,639
so yeah i just uh yeah we're it's

1078
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,199
working out just gotta listen to the

1079
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,799
plan you know we were just we were just

1080
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,879
you know we weren't we didn't have any

1081
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,880
like you know education-ness or guidance

1082
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,160
we were just literally just like you

1083
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,119
know like we do everything just

1084
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,440
listening

1085
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,318
just being guided by the plant and

1086
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,480
it's amazing how far that can get you

1087
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:18,639
you know it's amazing that's really just

1088
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,559
what it is our ancestors did that that's

1089
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,639
just how it is you know

1090
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:25,039
it's really effective it got us all this

1091
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:27,519
far look at all the amazing genetics and

1092
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:30,239
lines and green breeding you know that's

1093
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:32,960
that's happened throughout you know like

1094
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,639
a long many many years so

1095
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,119
yeah it's just uh it's really good that

1096
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:39,358
we're all here swapping seeds and

1097
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,519
you know i think it's awesome it's

1098
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:43,358
really cool how everybody's like let not

1099
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,838
holding on to shit anymore like it used

1100
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,559
to be like this like whole lockdown you

1101
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:48,318
know

1102
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,159
and that's kind of also why i just was

1103
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:52,000
like doing my own thing you know just

1104
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,598
because we were just doing our own thing

1105
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,280
we weren't like messing with anyone

1106
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,599
else's stuff really

1107
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,040
so yeah it's just been now so it's

1108
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,039
really nice that to have all this

1109
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,599
variety because that's you know that's

1110
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:04,960
just like that's what life is about

1111
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,838
variety

1112
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,838
all right cool

1113
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,479
um i'll keep this short uh what nick

1114
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,479
said

1115
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,599
um yeah i'm just working lines is

1116
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,440
definitely what i'm into too and um

1117
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,680
you know you kind of

1118
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,000
you kind of see what you're want to look

1119
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,118
for in your your first generation and

1120
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,440
then you get to see what you're working

1121
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,640
with in your second generation and

1122
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,800
you know so

1123
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,639
and it is like i'm sure everyone up here

1124
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,880
will agree like it's about getting lucky

1125
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,920
too you know it's like sometimes

1126
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,920
you just

1127
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,920
but then if you have like the population

1128
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,519
to do the sifs like if you start enough

1129
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,639
seeds

1130
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:52,719
of uh you know f1 f2 f3 you're gonna

1131
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,480
find one that looks just like her mother

1132
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,519
and that's the one you made the seeds on

1133
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,440
you know that's the one you want to

1134
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,759
stabilize and sometimes you get lucky

1135
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,119
and find her and you know 40 seeds or

1136
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,119
less you know sometimes you don't you

1137
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,559
gotta look again the next generation or

1138
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,160
there's been a lot of times where i make

1139
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,279
a generation of seeds get the pot i'm

1140
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,799
like although i'm not gonna make it this

1141
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,400
year this isn't you know i didn't find

1142
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,359
what i was looking for but

1143
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,440
you know

1144
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,519
it's fun and you're gonna lose things

1145
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,000
and you're gonna find things and it is

1146
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:21,119
uh beautiful working with this plant

1147
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,760
this plant's spirit you know the the

1148
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,358
you know cannabis is

1149
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,040
i mean everything's consciousness right

1150
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:28,480
you know our light or vibrate whatever

1151
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,800
you could look at on the molecular level

1152
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,480
and something like cannabis or the

1153
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,920
cactus or some other plants that

1154
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,519
interact with our consciousness they

1155
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,119
have a higher concentration of that and

1156
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,800
we get to co-create with that and we get

1157
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,800
to find whatever you know

1158
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,400
you any one of us could take a line and

1159
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,519
go a different direction with it when we

1160
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,680
put our heart into it and that's a

1161
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,519
beautiful thing too and it is beautiful

1162
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,759
to share uh those genetics with

1163
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,519
everybody and and

1164
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,200
and to not worry like worry about

1165
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,400
getting it out there because you're

1166
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,519
gonna do something beautiful with it and

1167
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,960
we might go somewhere else with it and

1168
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,559
then we get something back from somebody

1169
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,599
or lose something and

1170
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:03,920
yeah that co-creation with this plant

1171
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,680
and uh and yeah we really need that

1172
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,920
right now

1173
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,078
uh as a planet and the people what

1174
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,639
cannabis can do from like oil production

1175
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,000
to medicine and just with consciousness

1176
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:16,159
in general

1177
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,760
you know and and i'm also very excited

1178
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,399
that uh psychedelics are going to be

1179
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,640
legal soon hopefully in the next

1180
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,639
like our lifetime across the united

1181
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,799
states

1182
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,000
um

1183
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,599
yeah i mean

1184
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
if you listen you know

1185
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,440
she calls to you she talks to you and

1186
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,599
and then you get to put your input in

1187
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,519
too and it's a fun relationship as a

1188
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,440
breeder that you develop with your

1189
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,199
plants in your lines and then your

1190
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,119
fringe lines like you know like you know

1191
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:46,159
we're all doing like amazing work or you

1192
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,160
know or getting lucky

1193
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:53,679
[Applause]

1194
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,318
yeah i mean

1195
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:59,440
with regard to what we like to grow

1196
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:00,960
uh basically when we first started out

1197
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,720
um

1198
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,400
you know definitely just these seeds i

1199
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:05,919
had been seeking out

1200
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,838
i was basically looking for seeds that

1201
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,480
had been

1202
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:12,400
grown living soil and on the full sun

1203
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,480
that were resistant and of course that

1204
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,960
tasted really good and things like that

1205
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,400
i mean since then we've probably

1206
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,800
ever on this panel we've got a little

1207
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,838
bit of genetics from we have some from

1208
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,560
amanda's garden and joey and tamara we

1209
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:28,480
got some seeds from so

1210
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:30,799
we just love to mix it up we love to

1211
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,880
smoke and so we like to try lots of

1212
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,240
different things and

1213
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,240
from day to day or you know our taste or

1214
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:41,279
our palette might change but we

1215
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:43,199
definitely will go for commercial

1216
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,079
uh as well so

1217
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,318
um

1218
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,880
but we're not too fixated on having them

1219
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,639
all be purple you know if if you end up

1220
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,640
having a little bit of mixed phenotypes

1221
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,078
but they all have a certain smell uh

1222
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:55,920
we're super

1223
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,839
into like some you know uniformity in

1224
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,480
that sense um

1225
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:02,639
but hash also we're definitely been

1226
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,318
reading for and thankful to jesse for

1227
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,358
getting us some of the nana breath and

1228
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:10,400
the other banana og crosses

1229
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:13,679
they've been super nice for us

1230
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,440
yeah bananas coffees uh

1231
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:19,799
just lots of different

1232
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,800
guavas watermelons blueberries

1233
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,400
just kind of mixing it all up it's

1234
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:24,399
always been fun

1235
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:31,519
[Applause]

1236
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,440
so

1237
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,400
um

1238
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,480
i'm into hash as well now by the way

1239
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,480
uh and so that's another part that i'm

1240
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,639
super excited in the

1241
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,358
i like i'm seriously mostly focused on

1242
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:48,159
hash line seeds for

1243
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,279
growing because i really just like

1244
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,598
well

1245
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,160
truth is is when the resin

1246
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:58,400
is stored i can have something for years

1247
00:45:54,159 --> 00:46:00,639
that's really like it was and the flower

1248
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,318
you know it's bulky and big and

1249
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:03,920
i don't know but

1250
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,800
so there's this beauty and hash that

1251
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,480
i've really been tuning into um so from

1252
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,920
a genetic standpoint that's definitely

1253
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,039
been something i

1254
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,800
i have felt but i think you know things

1255
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:17,199
have been rolling for quite a while

1256
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,839
how's everybody feeling do we want to

1257
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:22,639
keep rolling down this path or should we

1258
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,318
kind of take a break and walk around and

1259
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:25,920
what do you guys think it's it's way

1260
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,318
past the time i can't i don't know when

1261
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,519
we started i don't know where we're at

1262
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,960
um

1263
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,199
keep going

1264
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,800
cool um

1265
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,960
yeah let's do another round we got it we

1266
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,119
don't rarely are we all in this kind of

1267
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,800
scenario together so

1268
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,760
um

1269
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,920
let's see we have

1270
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,920
so

1271
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,519
when i

1272
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:53,598
when i talk to people about

1273
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:55,199
what are you going to get from a seed

1274
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,440
standpoint

1275
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,039
um you know i like to have some

1276
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,039
categories of like steering people in

1277
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,119
the right direction to kind of most help

1278
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:05,440
them in their path towards what they're

1279
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,039
trying to do so it's like

1280
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,880
trying to uh

1281
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:10,239
create a whole bunch of stuff

1282
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,800
and so there's all these names that

1283
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,639
people use in our cannabis genetics and

1284
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,720
and and i just kind of want to address

1285
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,799
them a little bit and be like

1286
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:21,519
there's a lot of loose

1287
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,039
meaning to a lot of the language uh when

1288
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,358
it comes to

1289
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:29,039
f1 f2

1290
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:32,318
um there's a lot of uh you know

1291
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,880
it's it's not super dialed within within

1292
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:37,119
cannabis breeding or it hasn't been as

1293
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,039
much but um i think it's important for

1294
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,920
us to explore it and to understand it

1295
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:41,759
more

1296
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,240
and to understand like what agriculture

1297
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,280
normally does in in the breeding sense

1298
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,000
and so

1299
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,119
i was talking about inbred lines and and

1300
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,679
you know

1301
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,000
the value of breeding within inbred

1302
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:56,318
lines to create hybrids that really have

1303
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
a lot of vigor and all that but i want

1304
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,558
to talk a little bit about

1305
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,280
uh the benefits and the and the the

1306
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,280
value of poly hybrids as well because

1307
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,440
you know there's a lot of uh there's a

1308
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,079
lot of poly hybrids around and a lot

1309
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,000
less of the more strict line work has

1310
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,680
been being done and you know there's a

1311
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,119
lot to learn when you get on that path

1312
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:19,358
of strict line work um and and when you

1313
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:23,039
peter out or or just understanding that

1314
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:25,519
inbred lines do kind of slowly become a

1315
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,400
less of a productive thing but it should

1316
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:30,639
be being more honed and as you narrow

1317
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,680
that further your population should

1318
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:35,440
start to become increasing so you might

1319
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,279
bottleneck some things a couple

1320
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,679
generations to try and steer it in the

1321
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,280
direction you want but at that after

1322
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,118
that point when you've honed something

1323
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,720
that you've got and most of them are

1324
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,720
showing that you want to open the

1325
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:49,358
population's backup because you don't

1326
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:51,919
want to keep taking one single parent

1327
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:54,239
and one single male and only doing that

1328
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,400
you want to make start to increase the

1329
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:59,598
genetic diversity amongst your

1330
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,240
bottleneck genetics already so inbred

1331
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,880
line work is more than just continually

1332
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,879
filial generationally crossing but you

1333
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,280
also want to think about some

1334
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,400
population expansions as you getting

1335
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,680
into a

1336
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,358
lesser or more inbred degraded state

1337
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,279
which are actually really good for

1338
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,519
breeding and people shouldn't get scared

1339
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,319
of an inbred line that doesn't produce

1340
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:24,079
and grow like a hybrid does but you

1341
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,920
don't get them for that you don't get

1342
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,920
them for production you get those inbred

1343
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,599
lines because you want to work with them

1344
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,599
from a breeding standpoint because they

1345
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:36,079
create a super vigorous f1 uh

1346
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,440
hybrid offspring but let's i want to go

1347
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,839
down the line and just let people

1348
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,480
address poly hybrids and how poly

1349
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:44,799
hybrids and working with poly hybrids

1350
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,519
what that's like for you

1351
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,519
so here we go

1352
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,279
man

1353
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,280
is it working

1354
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,079
man that was excellent information i

1355
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:08,318
hope everyone was actually paying

1356
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,160
attention to that um

1357
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,880
yeah there's a lot to

1358
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,039
think about with that so um i really

1359
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,079
appreciate nick's constant work to go

1360
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:18,000
down

1361
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,079
you know like

1362
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,639
multiple multiple generations like

1363
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,480
getting to f6 seven eight

1364
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,400
um in different varieties and when you

1365
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,280
get to that point it's a certain level

1366
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,720
of line breeding that breeds over very

1367
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,280
true as far as

1368
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:35,279
genetics go and and the hybrids that

1369
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,599
come out of that are really amazing

1370
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,240
you know when we first met we there was

1371
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,720
these um it was with ryan from humble

1372
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:44,719
seeds and the glazed cherry and he gave

1373
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:45,919
you those i gave you the black dog and

1374
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,558
you took them to like multiple

1375
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,440
generations and then put them together

1376
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,599
and

1377
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,599
those hybrids were so

1378
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,480
even and so much bigger like you could

1379
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,800
just see that multiple generation

1380
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,880
bigger and it's like you know that's how

1381
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,160
a lot of breeding's done in agriculture

1382
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,039
for vegetables and everything you take

1383
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:07,440
stuff to pretty far generation fa f9 and

1384
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:09,920
then you put them together to make an f1

1385
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,440
that is a true vigorous hybrid and

1386
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,400
there's actually strangely enough a

1387
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,280
certain uniformity in and what happens

1388
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,200
from

1389
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,519
that crossing of varieties when they're

1390
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,679
there to that point of line breeding but

1391
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,880
he also just gave really a really good

1392
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:24,639
information

1393
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,960
around not getting bottlenecked

1394
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:28,879
genetically so as you you know you start

1395
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,960
off early you're making very

1396
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,400
solid selections for exactly what you

1397
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,519
want it to be you're building that

1398
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,760
cannon of the flavor the like

1399
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:39,119
the resistance the structure all the

1400
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,960
factors that you're thinking about and

1401
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,200
building that but then you want to make

1402
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,720
sure that you're using multiple males

1403
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,558
and then if you're putting that on to

1404
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,000
multiple females and this is from

1405
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,400
sibling generation

1406
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
that you then get to really choose from

1407
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,318
those females but you know that they've

1408
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,280
been pollinated with multiple males and

1409
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,440
so then

1410
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,319
as you've already done some work towards

1411
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,920
that

1412
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:00,880
um

1413
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,318
selecting what you want and

1414
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,079
stabilization of that variety you make

1415
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:06,480
sure not to bottleneck it and then you

1416
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,720
can work that for for longer so that's

1417
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,760
it's really like opening that potential

1418
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:11,759
to not

1419
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,680
get too far down that line and what

1420
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,040
happens is actually smaller and smaller

1421
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:18,639
plants a little

1422
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:21,279
less bigger and but but more and more

1423
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,558
smaller seeds yeah yeah and and but more

1424
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,079
and more

1425
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,640
um

1426
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:29,119
similar too though you know and so it's

1427
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:30,799
an incredibly useful thing but f1s are

1428
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,640
amazing too so

1429
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,720
anyway poly hybrids that's actually what

1430
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,838
the question's about or

1431
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:38,000
what we're supposed to be talking about

1432
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,318
and i fucking love poly hybrids i love

1433
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
the work of of going down multiple

1434
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,400
generations i also love back crossing

1435
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,519
work too which is going back to a

1436
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,358
generation

1437
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:49,039
the original generation that what you

1438
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:50,558
like the most of something and it's a

1439
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:52,480
way of like kind of stacking the

1440
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,000
genetics onto each other and you can get

1441
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,519
to a higher percentage of the same

1442
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,199
genetic in that next generation really

1443
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,199
quickly so that's something i like to do

1444
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,480
and then i like to combine that with

1445
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,879
then doing

1446
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,318
uh sibling cr uh generations from that

1447
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,920
and so making the

1448
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:10,239
vc1 f2 or f5 or something in the black

1449
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,720
dog case and then it becomes a very much

1450
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,039
just that genetic it's the and very

1451
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:16,719
useful for breeding because it it's it's

1452
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:19,119
similar to that wine breeding of getting

1453
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:19,919
to a f8 or something

1454
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,160
but

1455
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,519
during that time with poly hybrids you

1456
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:25,358
get to like

1457
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,199
do all kinds of things i i only line

1458
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:28,960
breed like a couple things you know each

1459
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,480
year you choose a few things that you're

1460
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,920
going to work pretty good

1461
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,280
and then but then you have the potential

1462
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,559
to do whatever you want so i don't

1463
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,000
really want to limit that and so it's

1464
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,559
pretty exciting to be like oh my god

1465
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,838
this would be amazing with that and just

1466
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:44,079
it's all these probability like wave

1467
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:45,440
fields of potential and goodness that

1468
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,079
you're like

1469
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,559
looking at and wanting to see happen

1470
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,880
and uh yeah it's just a super fun

1471
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:54,400
selection process it's a it's a freedom

1472
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,039
it's a jazz it's a

1473
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,480
art like that you get to just kind of

1474
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:59,920
immerse yourself in the moment and

1475
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,400
figure out like

1476
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,240
man this should go here on this and i

1477
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,760
just can't wait and you're so excited

1478
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:06,799
about it like as soon as it happens and

1479
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,319
it's like oh my god i'm going to crack

1480
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,079
these next year and i want to make sure

1481
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:11,838
my friends grow these and then you get

1482
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,640
to see it on other farms and places and

1483
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:14,880
that's

1484
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:17,199
so exciting to see something

1485
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,240
new and all kinds of amazing things come

1486
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:22,239
out of poly hybrids and it can be very

1487
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:24,479
you know different too so i like to

1488
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:27,199
really label the polyhybrids because

1489
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,000
there can be certain aspects that

1490
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:29,679
that

1491
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,519
come from the line breeding so they can

1492
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,039
actually kind of be some relatively

1493
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,719
stable sometimes and then other

1494
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,318
combinations will be all over the place

1495
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:38,399
and it depends on those combinations

1496
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,480
going in and so i'd like to kind of like

1497
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,639
be able to let people know a bit and

1498
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,000
guide like on what you know you might be

1499
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:44,798
experiencing with something you know

1500
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,358
there's

1501
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:49,039
three very select kind of things that

1502
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:51,119
come out of it or there's a certain

1503
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:54,000
uniformity or it's just all over the

1504
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,838
place but um

1505
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
yeah i just i just love the the

1506
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:01,119
selection process and and

1507
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,159
um really respect the the length of time

1508
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:06,318
to put each year into making a selection

1509
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:08,239
on that next generation like to grow out

1510
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:11,199
several plants and to then continue on

1511
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:13,199
that's a very useful thing and um you

1512
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:14,558
know nick with the seeds that he's

1513
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:16,239
brought today

1514
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,319
a lot of people have some really useful

1515
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,919
breeding tools in their hand because now

1516
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:21,199
you actually have a lion bread thing

1517
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,920
that you could put with another one to

1518
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:24,000
make

1519
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,440
true hi you know

1520
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
f1 hybrids that are going to have that

1521
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,349
vigor uniformity that we expect in all

1522
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,349
agriculture

1523
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:37,849
[Music]

1524
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:37,849
[Applause]

1525
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:45,358
so yeah keeping the uh the diversity in

1526
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,318
the stock is important like uh my dad

1527
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:48,719
always

1528
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:50,639
said keeping more than just one one of

1529
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,798
the males around

1530
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:55,358
at least keep keep a couple of them to

1531
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:57,119
breed on you know keeping the the

1532
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:58,400
diversity in the stock

1533
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,000
um

1534
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,400
that you never know what you're gonna

1535
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,920
get out of those seeds then like there

1536
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,480
might be one in there that's just like

1537
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,480
b1

1538
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,680
louder

1539
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:17,679
um poly hybrids i

1540
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,000
i like uh i i breed

1541
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:21,919
i bred the velvet perps down

1542
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,039
like five or six generations so it's

1543
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:28,318
pretty stable and then um definitely

1544
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,199
bringing them back on other varieties

1545
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,039
and

1546
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:33,439
you know it it just uh shows the

1547
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,318
diversity of you know what we're working

1548
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,400
with

1549
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:39,519
and uh

1550
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,318
it's just really special and

1551
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:44,440
i'm

1552
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:44,440
happy to do it so

1553
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:53,199
poly hybrids i say

1554
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:58,440
are the best

1555
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:58,439
for people hunting clonal stock

1556
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:10,110
[Laughter]

1557
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:14,400
yeah

1558
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:17,280
um yeah what no but seriously what nick

1559
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,599
said yeah like uh for clone stock yeah

1560
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,760
that's kind of

1561
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,640
yeah because i've yeah this just depends

1562
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,640
on the direction you want to go right

1563
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,879
you know who your clients are what your

1564
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:31,679
market is so i mean a lot of this really

1565
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,680
is depends on who who your clients are

1566
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:35,358
and where where your market is so it's

1567
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:38,078
kind of like

1568
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:40,078
but yeah as far as poly hybrids um

1569
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,680
yeah like if you're which is kind of

1570
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,839
good because you you have your poly

1571
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:46,239
hybrid you have you make a an amazing

1572
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:48,639
selection and then you clo you're

1573
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:50,399
working that line there and

1574
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:52,798
which you're gonna get some really nice

1575
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,559
diversity and then you can just kind of

1576
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:55,519
work with that because

1577
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,920
you know

1578
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:00,159
there's a lot of ways to

1579
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,519
you know i don't know it just depends on

1580
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:03,279
i really feel like it depends on like

1581
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:06,559
what you're trying to do a lot of the

1582
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,440
times you know that just makes off that

1583
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,880
just

1584
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,318
makes you know

1585
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,760
whatever you know you go in that

1586
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:13,679
direction so

1587
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,359
you know for me that's kind of like the

1588
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,078
poly hybrid thing is cool because i make

1589
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:20,318
a selection and and run that in my

1590
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,519
greenhouse and uh in like a high yield

1591
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:23,838
in you know

1592
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:24,880
uh see a green style and that kind of

1593
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:26,798
works

1594
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,200
um then i get to get what i'm looking

1595
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:32,159
for but but lately i mean i've just been

1596
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,118
kind of running with you know whatever

1597
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:35,920
different

1598
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:40,160
hype clones and you know bullshit just

1599
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,159
because like the market all right

1600
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,160
hey everybody um

1601
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,599

[Applause]

1619
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,880
which you know with the price of inputs

1620
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,920
you know it seems like everyone's going

1621
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,280
to be hitting that route you know

1622
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,039
i'm about to go get a truckload of

1623
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,720
mistletoe i'm excited for the high

1624
00:59:57,039 --> 00:59:59,838
phosphorus

1625
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:02,798
um

1626
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:04,960
yeah it's fun working the lines and i

1627
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:07,838
like to grow for like production for

1628
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,000
like a commercial farm like an f3 the f6

1629
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:11,838
and i've seen some f3s that are really

1630
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,880
stable and i've seen some f4s that

1631
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:17,440
aren't um but stable stable enough to

1632
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,880
blend and you know moongazers here

1633
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,798
they're you know

1634
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,720
they're doing some smaller batches stuff

1635
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:24,798
which is also kind of like uh it could

1636
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:26,798
be a niche market trend anyway like i

1637
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:28,480
know like smaller batches are easy to

1638
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:29,679
work with and and we're going to see

1639
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,838
what that's like when we're going some

1640
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:33,440
true f1s in a few years you know they're

1641
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:35,199
going to see that's going to be fun you

1642
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,639
know i have the velvet coffee i'm going

1643
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,558
to be starting which is

1644
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:41,118
you know not you know but two stable

1645
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,960
lines um bread in together i'm excited

1646
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:46,640
for that and

1647
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,639
i also bring a lot of autoflowers and

1648
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:52,239
back cross it uh into that with the

1649
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:54,838
photo periods and just for getting the

1650
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:57,439
here you go what nick

1651
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:59,599
said i'm just gonna just repeat what

1652
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,679
jesse said i fucking love how they hyped

1653
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,680
up

1654
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:10,639
testing testing

1655
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:12,720
i just absolutely love polly hybrids too

1656
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:15,358
yeah i guess yeah i didn't know about

1657
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:17,199
cloning but i just love to find them and

1658
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,440
breed them and then just kind of do the

1659
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:20,960
whole cycle again we keep our males

1660
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,720
pretty close

1661
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:27,679
like just far enough and downwind so

1662
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:29,039
i love each every of each of our 600

1663
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,838
plants to

1664
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:34,400
have like one seed in it so if i find

1665
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:36,880
some pheno that i didn't breed i can

1666
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:39,119
just i'll plant that and if it's a male

1667
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,599
i'll use it if it's a female i'll

1668
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:44,000
definitely seed it up

1669
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,000
that's it

1670
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:49,199
sweet yeah

1671
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:50,838
i like if you're looking for hash

1672
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:53,519
if you're looking for the best hash

1673
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:56,239
varieties you gotta go find the poly

1674
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:59,599
hybrids and look at the back stock the

1675
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:02,078
lineage in there and all the stuff

1676
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:05,039
should be from other

1677
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:07,440
hash varieties too so

1678
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:09,440
so yeah yay for poly hybrids uh we

1679
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,000
should never like look down on that yay

1680
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,920
for inbred lines we love them yay for

1681
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,239
the back crosses we could get into that

1682
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,519
and i have a whole my own kind of way of

1683
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:21,679
back crossing but

1684
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:24,480
um back to generation even next

1685
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:26,318
generation but anyway

1686
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,000
