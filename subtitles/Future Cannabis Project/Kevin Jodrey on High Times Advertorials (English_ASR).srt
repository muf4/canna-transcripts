1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,720
what you have is you have information

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,990
that's used is basically marketing it's

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,040
kind of like reading old high times God

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,469
and read the shit in years it's like

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,899
reading high times and every article was

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:15,268
basically to sell the material on the

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,710
next page so they're not giving you any

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,690
information they're giving you a

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,028
marketing pitch wrapped around some

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,460
photos so the problem is you're not

11
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:25,890
really getting true info you're getting

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,900
marketing and what people need is true

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,449
info because that's what's gonna

14
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,159
resonate and I think in these could this

15
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,239
kind of community that's what you get

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,949
and when people come to hang out and

17
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:39,780
experience that type of situation their

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,670
educational level skyrockets and their

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,850
appreciation of cannabis culture

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,189
skyrockets and it means if they'll take

21
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,809
the time to ask the person at the

22
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:52,619
counter would you direct me into

23
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:54,959
something like this because the person

24
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,030
at the counter who's the lowest paid

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,799
person in the dispensary is the

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,520
gatekeeper to every one of your farm

27
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,519
successes
