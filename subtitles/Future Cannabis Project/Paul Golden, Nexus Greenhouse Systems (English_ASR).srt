1
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:14,599
today we presented on the benefits of

2
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,759
growing in a climate controlled hybrid

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,600
greenhouse and uh one of the major

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,080
focuses of the conversation that we had

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,519
was to kind of give people an idea of

6
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:25,919
what a advanced hybrid Greenhouse can do

7
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:27,959
these are State heart green houses

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,519
they're no no longer ground structures

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,279
or high tunnels they have all the uh

10
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:33,479
environmental controls of a warehouse

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,320
environment that's why we call them a

12
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,839
hybrid it's kind of a mix between

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,079
greenhouse and warehouse but they had

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,440
the benefits of a greenhouse in that

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,960
they're much much more uh cost efficient

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,000
in terms of producing cannabis mainly

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,759
because you have uh sunlight coming in

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,198
and that's that's the primary source of

19
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,839
your your cost and a warehouse

20
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,358
environment um additionally not running

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,160
all the lights that you would run in a

22
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,359
warehouse environment your cooling is

23
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,279
much much lower cost and Greenhouse

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,399
environment and that was one of the

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,040
major focuses of the talk was uh how

26
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:09,439
much light there is and how easy it is

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,040
to cool in the southwestern environments

28
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,399
um typically speaking as you get into a

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,040
climate that's drier we're able to use

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,560
more evaporative pads uh technology or

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,320
or um kind of like a swamp cooler more

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,439
or less to cool these environments and

33
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,199
it's basically the most efficient way to

34
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,679
cool a greenhouse or cool any structure

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,840
um maybe about a tenth of cost of what

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,799
would be to run HVAC otherwise a pad fan

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,640
system is basically a swap cooler on one

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,880
side of the structure where the air

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,439
moves in to the greenhouse we'll always

40
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,199
inse screen that that pad system uh so

41
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,559
there's no concern about outside

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,399
pathogens making it into the uh the

43
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,680
greenhouse we typically do what's called

44
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,519
antivirus screening which is down to 150

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,159
microns so that's that's thrip level

46
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:56,438
nothing nothing uh small nothing bigger

47
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,200
than a thrip can make it through that's

48
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:01,359
basically the smallest pest you're going

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,039
to get um next to a m which you know we

50
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:07,478
don't have too many mites um and we'll

51
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,000
move that through the pad system it'll

52
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:12,000
drop the temperature right there at that

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,479
pad system by maybe up to 25° and then

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
we'll exhaust that air through the

55
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:18,759
greenhouse from the pad wall to the

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,560
exhaust fan side and it may pick up some

57
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:23,199
temperature on the way through through

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,000
the greenhouse maybe up to 5° or so and

59
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,439
then we'll ultimately exhausted out the

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,719
exhaust fans with Cooling in a

61
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,359
greenhouse environment we're we're

62
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,080
definitely doing a better job

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,000
at at reducing your carbon footprint uh

64
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,160
using the pad system as opposed to a

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,120
warehouse environment where you have

66
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:42,280
HVAC systems uh for example every three

67
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,680
watts of uh Power used for lighting in a

68
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,959
warehouse environment requires about a

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,959
watt or Watt and a half of HVAC um to

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,560
cool it and dehumidify uh the warehouse

71
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,239
environment a warehouse might be as

72
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,920
large as $10 a square foot in in um

73
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,599
electricity for HVAC greous environments

74
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,798
probably likely less to be less less

75
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,878
than a dollar square foot give or take

76
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,640
uh for cooling a warehouse environment

77
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:11,479
will probably be

78
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:13,598
about you know 1520 a square foot in

79
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,719
lighting Greenhouse environment probably

80
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,919
about a third to a quarter of that so I

81
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,039
mean significant energy reduction and

82
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,439
and and a green house environment the

83
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,679
other one was how much you save in life

84
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,000
typically speaking in a w in a warehouse

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,840
environment you might uh you might get

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,239
about 30 m a day of power on your crop

87
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,000
in a greenhouse environment you get more

88
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,959
like 40 m a day uh per meter square of

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,158
power on your crop and it's all free for

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560
the most part about 85% the year you're

91
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:43,280
going to get you're going to hit that

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,479
Target DLI and you're not paying for it

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,199
otherwise you're going to have to

94
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,199
supplement a little

95
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,959
bit cannabis has a number of uh unique

96
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:57,518
features mainly because it's been grown

97
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,319
uh indoors for so long and there's

98
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,920
certain strains that just don't have the

99
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:03,878
the strength of an outdoor plant you

100
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,438
know they don't have the resiliency and

101
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:10,120
so uh they the plant would prefer a high

102
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,438
level control than a typical Greenhouse

103
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,158
would offer our state-of-the-art canvas

104
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:16,839
green houses though they offer all the

105
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:21,120
levels of control of Warehouse humidity

106
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:23,079
CO2 light levels temperature and cooling

107
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,879
um as well as insect exclusion which

108
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,959
minimizes your risk of you know any kind

109
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,120
of pest getting in there and breaking

110
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:33,000
out um the biggest thing though is that

111
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,160
traditional crops didn't tend to use as

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,319
much light deprivation equipment as uh

113
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,199
canvas crop needs for for guaranteeing

114
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,038
your 1212 light cycle regardless of what

115
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,439
time of year it is um with the Nexus

116
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:46,759
structure what we've ended up doing is

117
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,079
we integrate a lot of the flashing for

118
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,840
the light deprivation equipment right

119
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,198
into the structure itself and we do a

120
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,119
better job of guaranteeing there's no

121
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,840
light penetrations on that crop

122
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,160
preventing it from self-pollinating or

123
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,439
causing any kind of total crop loss from

124
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
light getting in there during the flower

125
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,519
CLE

126
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,240
um and that's one of the biggest things

127
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,439
you know it was it was in the industry

128
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,319
prior to cannabis it was used a lot in

129
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,600
chrysanthum for example but it just

130
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,959
didn't have the degree of uh control we

131
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,439
have now and it's all automated so it

132
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,719
all comes through the the the

133
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,439
environmental controller which is the

134
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,720
brain of the greenhouse it monitors the

135
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,038
light level inside the greenhouse and

136
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,080
switches on and off lights as needed uh

137
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,599
it monitors the light level and the heat

138
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,758
inside the greenhouse and closes and

139
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,720
opens shade systems as needed and then

140
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,479
it Al also knows whether it's going

141
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,960
going to be um going into flower or not

142
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,159
and it automatically closes the curtains

143
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,519
at say 7:00 at night to guarantee that

144
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,199
you get that 1212 light cycle one of the

145
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,799
things that Nexus does when it designs

146
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,360
this cannabis Greenhouse is we fully

147
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,319
integrate the controller with all the

148
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,479
equipment that's inside the structure so

149
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,759
uh one example of how this might take

150
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,120
place is when you start to go into

151
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,520
blackout say at 7:00 at night um our

152
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,759
controllers automatically know okay as

153
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,680
you start to go into blackout the plant

154
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
still transpiring the humidity levels

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,400
are going to increase so we need to do

156
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,959
some things to uh reduce humidity as

157
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,079
we're going into blackout because

158
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,839
basically what happens is when you go

159
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,439
into blackout you close that shade

160
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,159
system and you shrink the envelope

161
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:17,439
inside the greenhouse the shade systems

162
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,919
kind of hung from the trusses and uh

163
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,360
it's a smaller volume of air the plants

164
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:23,038
are still transpiring so the humidity

165
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,400
levels raised inside that inside that

166
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,639
green if you don't do anything at all um

167
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,000
the controller is smart enough to know

168
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,319
that says hey I need to bent out a

169
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,879
certain amount of air I need to close

170
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,160
the shade system slowly and put these

171
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,918
plants to sleep and also maybe raise the

172
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,240
air temperature to keep this plant from

173
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:41,598
reaching its dpoint temperature uh on

174
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,400
the leaf cuz basically what happens is

175
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:45,879
you know when you when you close the

176
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,519
blackout system the leaf is constantly

177
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,399
radiating out infrared radiation so Leaf

178
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:53,000
temperature is always cooler than air

179
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,598
temperature which means it's easy for

180
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,959
that leaf temperature to reach the D

181
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:58,279
point and uh this happens all the time

182
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,038
in a warehouse environments that's why a

183
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,359
lot of warehouses will have outbreaks

184
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:03,839
the powdery Miler um and then and the

185
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,038
HVAC system is sitting there running and

186
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,279
running and running trying to control

187
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,240
the humidity but what it's doing is it's

188
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,799
actually lowering the temperature and is

189
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,079
bringing that humidity level closer to

190
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,918
uh the dupoint temperature and you're

191
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,598
going to ultimately have an outbreak in

192
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:20,318
on the plants in a greenhouse

193
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:24,279
environment will set the controller to

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,960
pulse uh ventilate and heat and bring in

195
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,478
fresh outdoor air maybe a lower relative

196
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,318
humidity which would be great sometimes

197
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,560
it's at high relative humidity but we'll

198
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,240
heat it up and keep that plant from

199
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,598
reaching its dupoint temperature as

200
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,918
we're closing the shade system and all

201
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,199
we're basically guaranteeing is that the

202
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:43,000
relative humidities stay stable right

203
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,720
around that crop and we'll also do

204
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,439
additional mixing of air to guarantee

205
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,159
that the leaves stays dry and that

206
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,519
there's no dead zones inside the

207
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:52,719
structure it's all done basically

208
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,719
through

209
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:57,000
automation uh one of the big benefits of

210
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,079
a greenhouse environment is obviously

211
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,720
that you're getting so much natural

212
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,199
which is to anyone that's growing

213
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,039
cannabis will realize you know it's a

214
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,680
it's a it's a watts per gram kind of

215
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,120
thing you know that has direct

216
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
relationship to how much output you're

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,879
going to have out of that crop is how

218
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,000
much light it's receiving and uh a

219
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,520
greenhouse controller monitors the

220
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,598
amount of light that's taking that's

221
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,279
hitting the crop at the canopy level and

222
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:23,759
basically will regulate up and down the

223
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:27,038
amount of lighting that goes on inside

224
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,280
the structure to guarantee that it has a

225
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,038
steady amount of light throughout the

226
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,918
day

227
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:35,759
at the proper um quantities for the

228
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:37,598
plants and so you won't have variations

229
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,838
from season to season so your fall crop

230
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,440
won't be so much smaller than your

231
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,279
summer crop or your winter crop won't be

232
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,919
so much smaller than your fall crop you

233
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:47,120
want to have you know cost of production

234
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,919
year round all four seasons and so what

235
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,360
we'll do is we'll monitor that with our

236
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:53,240
controller and basically just switch on

237
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,839
and off the lights only as needed that

238
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,159
way it doesn't have any higher cost of

239
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,519
operation than than necessary we work

240
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:02,159
with a number of different uh lighting

241
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:04,000
manufacturers um we typically I'd say

242
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:07,240
about what we see in the field is about

243
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,278
90% of our installations are HPS it's

244
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,680
just one of those Technologies that's

245
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,120
been tried and true in the industry um

246
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,399
we do work with a number of different

247
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,919
LED manufacturers a lot of cutting edge

248
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,120
Technologies is coming out there

249
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,639
certainly being you know being developed

250
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,959
we're working with lumago uh technology

251
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,799
or or heer Spectra technology and uh of

252
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:30,039
course we still work with the

253
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:32,039
old uh Tred andrue gavitas as well

254
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,199
and pl lights so we kind of work across

255
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,480
different manufacturers there just

256
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,120
depending on whatever the customer was

257
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,800
looking for some customers have worked

258
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,679
with uh LEDs in the past and they and

259
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:42,719
they might be coming out of the

260
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,199
warehouse environment and they they like

261
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,759
the spectral properties that LEDs offer

262
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,560
um other guys been Horticulture Growers

263
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,519
for years and they've been using HPS for

264
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,879
other crops let's say tomatoes and uh

265
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,839
they're fine with that and they say okay

266
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,078
well we're just going to keep doing what

267
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,160
we're doing and it seems to work I think

268
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:03,239
the most interesting thing about the LED

269
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:06,199
technology is um in in a greenhouse

270
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,240
setting is the ability for dimming to

271
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,800
modulate the the amount of light output

272
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,720
um continuously as opposed to having

273
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:16,958
just large chunks turning it on 300 uh

274
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,079
micro moles per Meer squ or 600

275
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,479
micromoles per Meer squ supplementation

276
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:23,199
they can do it continuously all the way

277
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,879
from Zer micromoles up to 600 micromoles

278
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,480
and then depending on how much light is

279
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:30,120
coming through the greenhouse glazing or

280
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,079
the shade system um they could say okay

281
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,919
we have to turn on and off these lights

282
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,278
to a certain degree as opposed to

283
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,240
turning all on or all off and that's

284
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:42,360
kind of an interesting approach about

285
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,360
the LED technologies that out

286
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,759
there if you look back to the warehouse

287
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,399
Growers um and and a lot of the people

288
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,559
that you know came out of the

289
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,399
basement um they were measuring light in

290
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:58,239
a very non-scientific fashion um a lot

291
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,958
of times they're using terms like lucks

292
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,560
or foot candles to to measure how much

293
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,119
light this plant needs well you know the

294
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,359
science is evolved we know what the

295
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,039
plant needs we know what its ideal

296
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,278
instantaneous light levels are and we

297
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:14,439
know what it's uh daily accumulation

298
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,838
light levels should be um the plants

299
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,160
basically saturates itself uh it can't

300
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:23,079
produce any

301
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:26,240
more any more um growth once you hit

302
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:28,439
1500 micro moles per me squar per second

303
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,480
apart that's what we call the the photon

304
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,399
flux density that's a very high level

305
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,759
that's a most crops don't don't allow

306
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,360
themselves to to keep growing at that

307
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,838
level in a greenhouse environment

308
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,399
typically we try to hit um 1,000

309
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,079
micromoles per me Square par and Par is

310
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,879
really the amount the amount of light

311
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:49,239
that's in the spectrum between 400 NM

312
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,720
and 700 NM and that's the light that the

313
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,399
plant can use any light outside that

314
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,240
spectrum is really kind of wasted in

315
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,240
heat on the crop it just heats up the

316
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,759
crop and that's all it goes towards a

317
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,200
little bit of infrared um does some

318
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,278
stuff and a little bit of UV helps resin

319
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,079
production but but really it's the par

320
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:10,639
that that dictates the growth of the

321
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:13,719
plant um now if you think of the ppfd

322
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,480
which is the photon flux density of par

323
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,680
that's how many molecules or I'm sorry

324
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,560
how many droplets of of light are are

325
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,278
hitting a surface a square meter and

326
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:24,958
that's important but the other important

327
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,159
aspect about growth is how much it

328
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,078
accumulates over the course of the day

329
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,838
so if you think of light as as as

330
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,759
raining down on the crop

331
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,160
how much rain is hitting it right now is

332
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:37,600
the ppfd but the other important number

333
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:41,039
is the DLI the daylight integral which

334
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,920
is if you think of uh light raining down

335
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,599
the crop then the DLI would be the

336
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,799
amount of rain that's inside the rain

337
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,639
gauge over the course of the day so 40

338
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,240
mes a day per meter squared seems to be

339
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,360
about the perfect number for this crop

340
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,560
it's still it's still well within its

341
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,240
limits for um ppfd at 12-h hour light

342
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,439
cycle about th micr moles per meter

343
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,759
squar ppfd and we'll measure all this

344
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,720
inside the greenhouse environment we'll

345
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:11,879
use sensors uh such as an app light

346
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,920
sensor to to uh read at the canopy level

347
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:17,000
how much light's falling on that crop

348
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,519
and then we'll supplement only as needed

349
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,440
to guarantee that we're still hitting

350
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,600
those those Target numbers that we're

351
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,959
that we're shooting for and that's

352
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,920
that's to keep your crop from being

353
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,719
smaller one season from another season

354
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,958
or or less productive one season from

355
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,959
another season

356
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,120
we adhere a pretty strict standards uh

357
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,320
industry standards uh for Greenhouse

358
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,278
cooling and heating and um typically

359
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,278
what we will do is we'll size all of our

360
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,078
equipment we'll make sure all our

361
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,519
equipment size properly proper amount of

362
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,758
air flow through the greenhouse is what

363
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,959
dictates how cool the greenhouse will be

364
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,480
and the proper sized pad wall system

365
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:01,359
will dictate how cool um you can get

366
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,680
that Greenhouse be in the southwest

367
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,159
where we are right now it's not a very

368
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,559
humid uh day the pad system is very

369
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:11,000
functional because the lower the

370
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:13,039
humidity the outdoor humidity the closer

371
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,639
you can get to What's called the the

372
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,958
dupoint temperature which is a

373
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,720
theoretical uh limit for how cool you

374
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,078
can get a greenhouse using pad systems

375
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,000
couple degrees within that dupoint

376
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:25,198
temperature and you know in this area

377
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,839
let's say the hottest time of the year

378
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,519
is about 105° give or take that's about

379
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,800
average height high temperature out here

380
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,039
um the dupoint temperature the wet bulb

381
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,758
temperature at that point is probably

382
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:40,679
right around 70 give or take we can get

383
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,278
maybe within 5 Dees of that 75 um let's

384
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,599
say it was a very inefficient system or

385
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:45,198
it wasn't being ran properly people

386
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,560
aren't cleaning the screens this that

387
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,159
other maybe we're getting within 10

388
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,039
degre of that 80° but 80° is still a

389
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:54,519
pretty good temperature for the Cannabis

390
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,198
crop so um this is one of the best

391
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,879
climates to broke in a greenhouse

392
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,479
because you're able to cool even even

393
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,838
though it might be 100 and something de

394
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,720
outside typically speaking we can get a

395
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,560
20° reduction 25° reduction inside the

396
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,120
greenhouse in this climate um and we

397
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,319
also size our green houses so they have

398
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,320
the right amount of air flow through

399
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,000
them that helps keep it cool we'll also

400
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,920
size a shading system that that goes

401
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,559
into it so to R to reduce the amount of

402
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,919
light to just the right levels inside

403
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,758
there so the greenhouse isn't getting

404
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,000
any hotter than it needs to be a lot of

405
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,759
our covering that goes into the

406
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,879
greenhouse will actually filter out the

407
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,039
light that's not useful for the plant so

408
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,679
that's not contrib towards heat that's

409
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:34,159
great um and then lastly we'll just keep

410
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:35,758
the green houses short a lot of times

411
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,278
we'll keep our green houses less than

412
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,240
100 ft long for cannabis because they

413
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:41,559
want that high degree of control over

414
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,000
temperature and the shorter the

415
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:47,000
greenhouse the easier it is to maintain

416
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the temperature inside of it
