[Music]

2
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:21,868
home and medical has its own home and

3
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,449
there's proper funding an infrastructure

4
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:25,670
in place to produce medical cannabis and

5
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,260
there's companies that are producing

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:32,160
high-grade products that are doable and

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,320
and pure and repeatable and you know the

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,140
studies can be done that the product can

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,429
be delivered you know when it's proven

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,200
successful you know these are these are

11
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,030
the steps that have to happen

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,679
I agree Patrick but but I don't think

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,179
you didn't separate some well here's

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,979
worry where it has to be is you know for

15
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:50,189
example right now the competition to get

16
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,409
a manufacturers license is dominated by

17
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:53,759
the recreational market yeah right so

18
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:56,099
how does how do how do people who want

19
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,539
to make real medicine who how do they

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,980
get the manufacturers license when

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,948
there's already so much interest and so

22
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,869
much money and so much value to those

23
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:06,780
licenses well this is what I think that

24
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:09,239
you can't separate them because we are

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,439
what we do is we do within the cities

26
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:12,929
and counties that we work

27
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,428
that's all that we do is we speak to the

28
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:16,829
City Council and the County Supervisors

29
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:18,750
about separating this because you have

30
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:19,949
to understand the do between what would

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,799
be they don't understand they don't

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,780
reducing their they're falling for the

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,789
new stigma which is that they see all

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,679
these people buying cannabis from a

35
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:31,319
dispensary under the under the guise of

36
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:33,659
it being medical when they recognize

37
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,390
that it's clearly is this is primarily a

38
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,209
recreational consumer and so there are

39
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,689
our own culture current culture is

40
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:44,640
devaluing the credibility of the man

41
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:46,500
obviously right this is why in the

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,390
Arcana conference which really gave a

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,218
front row seat to real herbalists who've

44
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,500
been doing this for ages and I said to

45
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:53,640
them I don't know how we're gonna

46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,759
operationalize that in terms of policy

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,590
or the economy of the market I have

48
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,728
always argued politically speaking we

49
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,590
gotta keep them separate you're

50
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:04,679
absolutely right that's a tactic we have

51
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,679
to keep them separate I know every

52
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:09,359
herbalist every true cannabis person

53
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:12,359
worth their salt knows that it's all

54
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:14,909
medical it's all medical because people

55
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:17,939
self-soothe and self treat for all kinds

56
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:23,789
of reasons and it's not harmful to do

57
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:25,229
that but if we if we if we make that if

58
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:27,689
we try to make that point that it's all

59
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:30,030
medical don't do it and again we can't

60
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,229
use them yes it's too could use all

61
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,560
you're right it's too confusing and

62
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:35,699
we're playing around with you know

63
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,159
lifestyles just between you and me and

64
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,439
the microphone okay my friend my friend

65
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,459
who has that Parkinson's now for about

66
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:46,240
10 years yeah and has resisted cannabis

67
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,650
for all ten years

68
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,480
and I had it readily available for him

69
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,400
in in the right forms and the right

70
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,649
doses and the right excessive

71
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,340
consumption and everything in place but

72
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,530
the state and and he actually his mother

73
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,110
produced cannabis medicine when he was a

74
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,419
child and when I first met him 40 years

75
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,490
ago he used to have this alcohol this

76
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:08,379
black alcohol that he saw that his mom

77
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,629
has soaked believes in to treat her

78
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:13,030
arthritis and at that point I was just

79
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:17,500
becoming a cannabis grower and I kind of

80
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:20,530
thought that was BS really it was a real

81
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,659
remedy and it it gave her everything

82
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,640
that she needed to treat her arthritis

83
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,500
and this may have a very normal life and

84
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,229
so he saw that but he was still afraid

85
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,930
of it because he grew up with the other

86
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:33,579
side being enforced you know it's bad

87
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,500
it's medicine as dangerous a dope you

88
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,540
know it's also a Hispanic family so I

89
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,680
think he knew it was best to stay clear

90
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:43,169
of it and so he did but most recently he

91
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,030
did finally decide that you would try

92
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,199
CBD yes and I don't know that this was

93
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,610
just like a week ago and I don't know

94
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,619
that it has benefited him I think he

95
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,659
waited a lot longer than he should

96
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,400
for effective treatment hey and I don't

97
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:57,439
know if he's taking enough you may need

98
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,200
to so he'll titrate up and see if it if

99
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,370
he keeps the keep going who knows how

100
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,649
many people change your minds if they

101
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:07,610
try cannabis and it is or isn't for them

102
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,319
sometimes and that's okay but I couldn't

103
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,060
agree with you more though we have to as

104
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:11,780
a political strategy we have to keep

105
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,189
them separate

106
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,079
yeah because otherwise we play right

107
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:16,279
into everybody's prejudices yeah well

108
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,900
then what he said to me says you know he

109
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,429
says gosh you know now that I'm taking

110
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,289
the cannabis and he says now that I

111
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,240
think about it everybody that he knows

112
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,460
who he's known throughout his life used

113
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,900
cannabis that was like they're all in

114
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:30,198
better health than the people who didn't

115
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:36,288
use cannabis yeah and I didn't even have

116
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,550
to you know okay no it's absolutely

117
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:39,829
share some truth to that

118
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,990
you know I've seen that I think maybe it

119
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:45,740
lowers the stress level keeps the

120
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:49,160
homeostasis yep helps you know create

121
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,168
let's create yeah no I totally agree I

122
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,000
totally agree it's it's but you wind

123
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:55,009
down with you know when you need to

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,720
which we all do the difference between

125
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:59,060
us and like when they're at the ended

126
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,979
alcohol prohibition was the alcohol

127
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,259
prohibition didn't have decades and

128
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:06,529
decades of disinformation campaign

129
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:08,990
really you know we've got an awful lot

130
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:12,149
to overcome in terms of those embedded

131
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:18,150
messages in people's minds

132
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:20,849
I mean we all make jokes about what's

133
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:21,509
the movie that you know reefer madness

134
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,010
yeah

135
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,719
and then we make jokes about that but

136
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,870
that's only the extreme you know I've

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,900
had patients who actually believe that

138
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,180
it is the devil's drug it's not an herb

139
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,769
it's a drug that weaves you directly to

140
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,650
heroin and crack cocaine they believed

141
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:39,569
it perfectly so that stuff's not dead

142
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:43,250
but I think what's far more pervasive

143
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:45,659
it's just a sphere just as feared

144
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,579
because it's so embedded in us and that

145
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,040
you know people don't like the idea of

146
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:55,949
losing control of their they think that

147
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:57,810
they'll somehow come unglued yeah no

148
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:01,349
it's true but I think there's also the

149
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:05,639
the disappointing you know it's a every

150
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:07,470
oppressed group racial minorities women

151
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,970
and immigrants every oppressed people

152
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,470
with disabilities every oppressed group

153
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,990
has a certain amount of internalized

154
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,060
oppression and what we've talked a lot

155
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,650
about in the last four years in the

156
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,259
activist cannabis community in Mendocino

157
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:21,539
cake is how much of those messages

158
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,329
people have internalized

159
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,330
and feel bad about themselves and feel

160
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:32,129
guilty and feel like they don't deserve

161
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:35,159
to get the honor and recognition that we

162
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:37,379
think they really should have as members

163
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,110
of a cannabis community that produce

164
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:51,180
this wonderful medicine beating down for

165
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:57,689
some hope they feel bad so there's an

166
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:59,550
answer light up exactly so we're talking

167
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:01,079
about social change after four decades

168
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,710
of prohibition that's not going to

169
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,659
happen overnight

170
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:10,729
this transition out of prohibition is

171
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:13,230
going to take we have a very active

172
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,910
social media they can't they can move

173
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,259
information very quickly yeah and

174
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,970
they're they're already becoming

175
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:23,370
uncomfortable with the pharmaceuticals

176
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:24,450
you know I know you know I remember the

177
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,870
first time that I saw a pharmaceutical

178
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:30,870
ad on TV and I haven't had a TV for 30

179
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,310
years so I just catch moments sometimes

180
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,079
it could be a year before or it's in a

181
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,910
bar or a restaurant but even restaurants

182
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,680
didn't always have a TV in them known I

183
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,880
stopped watching TV so there were

184
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,590
periods of years where I may not even

185
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,149
have seen a TV me too yeah and all of a

186
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:45,299
sudden I would see a TV course then I

187
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:47,579
would have a pharmaceutical suicide but

188
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,319
over the depression usually sitting with

189
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,339
my parents house yes because that's

190
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,930
where I would end up going to have

191
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:54,089
dinner yeah getting stuck in front of a

192
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,050
TV set and I and I couldn't believe that

193
00:07:54,089 --> 00:08:00,389
they were watching this yeah and not

194
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,590
alarmed it was just I mean they clicked

195
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,759
through those commercials just like the

196
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:06,839
other commercials if they remember to

197
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,699
click through them so the so the answer

198
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:10,379
has always been and everybody says it's

199
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,810
education education so I write an

200
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,639
article where I try to take the science

201
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,920
that we've learned a little bit from the

202
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,279
research studies the the huge Oxford

203
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,259
study about how THC reverses amyloid

204
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,869
plaques reverses Alzheimer's and

205
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,209
dementia the Salk study that from last

206
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,340
summer that substantiates the same thing

207
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:31,049
and I said okay there's all these new

208
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,419
scientific studies that we didn't know

209
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,190
about before I mean in 1860 Queen

210
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:38,819
Victoria's person

211
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,830
wrote in his diary using the hemp plant

212
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,110
as they called it back then for older

213
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:46,470
people with softening of the brain as he

214
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,990
put it has every single time been a

215
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,210
factor in reversing that softening of

216
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,240
the brain it works all the time so you

217
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,670
know we're getting some modern

218
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,919
statements of fact about you know using

219
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,679
people to treat so I was I wrote this

220
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:03,360
article and it's in the blog if you go

221
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,669
to qu fara dot-com all my blogs are

222
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,800
there it's like what if we started

223
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:09,299
earlier because all of the studies are

224
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,459
being done with people who already show

225
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:14,250
signs of dementia what if we started

226
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,650
micro dosing THC at age 50 and just did

227
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,019
it every day routinely don't you think

228
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:20,970
we might prevent so this is I think

229
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,689
where we can start to bridge that gap

230
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,700
you know and and and what that means is

231
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,620
well on the industry side what it means

232
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,390
is we got to come to terms with micro

233
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,750
dosing THC and not using it as a get

234
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:35,730
high and on the the medical

235
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,740
practitioners side and the patient side

236
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,529
we've got to start looking at herbal

237
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,990
medicine as a real choice for people to

238
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:46,019
be allowed to make and you've got I've

239
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,070
got so many patients who say when they

240
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,840
come in to

241
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,220
dragonflay on their like third or fourth

242
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,399
stage cancer and they talking to their

243
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,990
doctors about I'm gonna use cannabis for

244
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,970
to try to get on top of this and the

245
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,889
doctors lean into them and say I'm not

246
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,860
supposed to tell you this but you just

247
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:04,919
go ahead and do it I cannot tell you how

248
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,139
many times my own primary care physician

249
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,759
I said you know I want to tell you

250
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,960
something about what I'm doing and I

251
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,429
don't want you to type this up on your

252
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,930
computer so you takes his hands off the

253
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:14,399
keyboard turn sideways to be user

254
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:16,529
director of the clinic and Castro

255
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:33,090
mission clinic in San Francisco and I

256
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:34,259
said I use CBD for my arthritis they

257
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,330
were talking generally about using

258
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,580
cannabis I mean some of them are doctors

259
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,950
of my cat by cancer patients who tell

260
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,750
them they're gonna be using THC oil to

261
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,629
try to treat those cannabis those tumors

262
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,220
I had a 26 year old glioblastoma patient

263
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:49,009
she had a fourth stage she had of this

264
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,079
huge grill blastoma the

265
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:53,669
anyway I could tell you so many stories

266
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,500
and we could go on and on and on but

267
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:58,049
these are doctors who are recognizing

268
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,568
the effects why do we think we hope this

269
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:02,729
to reduce tumour and kill cancer reduce

270
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:06,088
tumors and kill cancer absolutely and

271
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,860
and heal other disease I mean this the

272
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:10,350
zme conference I went to in Columbus

273
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,610
Ohio a month ago this is all doctors and

274
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,350
nurses who are getting continuing

275
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,909
medical education credits to learn about

276
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,310
cannabis as medicine

277
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:18,838
Wow is that a step forward or what now I

278
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,938
was sitting around a big table of

279
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,920
doctors and nurses who are asking me to

280
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:25,198
sort of help help them understand what

281
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:27,269
the ether Rousseau's and the Dustin

282
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:29,549
Sulak you know they were like big pretty

283
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,889
high-end stuff and talking about how

284
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:33,899
that has worked with my patients in

285
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:36,568
practical application and they're

286
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,389
they're just like furious they're just

287
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:42,378
furious that they were not told a bit of

288
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:46,409
this in nursing school or medical school

289
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:50,399
yeah it's a sin and a crime

290
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:57,269
it is so I don't know two steps forward

291
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:58,679
three steps back I don't know

292
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:02,909
so Patrick will just keep doing what

293
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,799
we're doing huh that's right that's

294
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:06,299
exactly right and doing the education

295
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,809
that I'm really passionate about the

296
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,809
education

297
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:25,459
