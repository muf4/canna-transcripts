2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,718
so today just a little brief background

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,919
what's up here is a little bit about the

4
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:17,640
endoc canabo system and what you realize

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,359
is we don't know much about it it's only

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,000
been discovered in the early 90s we know

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,199
very little and there's more and more

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
that we learn every single day so that

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,240
was part of the calculation it's a

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,000
fascinating biological World it keeps

11
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,079
getting broader and more and more

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,878
interesting as we learn more about it

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,000
its key function is to regulate the

14
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:38,718
body's balance so you hear the word

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,280
homeostasis or a system of balance and

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,120
really that's what the endoc canabo

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,039
system does it's a series of receptors

18
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:48,159
and molecules that are activated for

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,960
mood regulation sleep regulation pain

20
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,679
regulation inflammation and it was this

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,679
critical part of the body that was never

22
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,679
taught to anyone in medical school and

23
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,558
still isn't today so it's uh quite

24
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,359
amazing and fascinating as a scientist

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,919
that you're thinking about the Forefront

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,079
of how to regulate the body's key

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,560
functions and you hear all of these

28
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,560
ailments that can be treated with

29
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,719
cannabis and you wonder why it's because

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,759
that endoc canono system is so critical

31
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,920
to what the body does so it's just know

32
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:16,400
that it is regulating your equilibrium

33
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,320
and you're trying to find the right

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,640
mixture of cannabis products for

35
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:24,279
yourself to balance yourself

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,840
out so um I like this Slide the most

37
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,599
because you'll see all the possible

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,960
ailments that are on there around the

39
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,719
circle and you'll see things like

40
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,639
anti-cancer anti-inflammatory bone

41
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,078
growth and what you'll notice about the

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,960
circle is THC is not in there so that's

43
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,478
probably most interesting is that all we

44
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,879
hear about in the media and everyone has

45
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:46,118
talked about for a long time was

46
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,399
tetrahydro canaban or THC and it is

47
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:51,000
perhaps not the most interesting medical

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,000
molecule inside of cannabis and it

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,239
really is all of the molecules at once

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,759
that makes medical cannabis special as

51
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,839
opposed to a single molecule like

52
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,039
Marinol or just

53
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,159
CBD um so that is you know the reason

54
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,960
that we're all here today is if it was a

55
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,319
single molecule that could be effective

56
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,598
and it could be isolated and used as an

57
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:12,280
efficient therapeutic in a

58
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,598
pharmaceutical sense we wouldn't have

59
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,640
medical cannabis interest like that but

60
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:20,000
many patients speak of the whole plant

61
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,598
products as being Superior and really

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,560
understanding all of the molecules the

63
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,079
plant has to offer is what makes that

64
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,640
unique so it's very different when you

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,959
offer to the body here is a whole host

66
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,559
of molecules and this is your body's

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,640
choice to choose which ones it wants to

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,080
balance itself uh a good analogy is

69
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,759
probably if I have a piano in front of

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,360
me and I just pound on the c key a lot

71
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,919
that's kind of like hitting one receptor

72
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,239
with THC but when I say here is the

73
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:49,719
whole plan I can play chords I can play

74
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,640
really nice tones much more pleasing to

75
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,000
my ears and the body kind of feels the

76
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,839
same way when you offer all the

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,280
molecules at once from the plant so

78
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,840
understanding what's in the plant how

79
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,199
that's going to be effectively delivered

80
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,239
to the patients and which combinations

81
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,280
of those molecules are best of interest

82
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,439
to which patient population is kind of

83
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,439
the complexity of medical

84
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,000
cannabis so that was certainly what got

85
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,479
me interested and then I got to kind of

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,519
dig through all of these wonderful

87
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,359
molecules and what you'll see is there's

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,959
predominant ones called cannaboids that

89
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,959
we talk about mostly THC um but there's

90
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,959
a whole host of other ones there's tur

91
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,319
beans which are related to the smell and

92
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,319
the sensory perception of that and also

93
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,699
have physiological activity and then the

94
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,158
anti-inflammatories of the flavonoids as

95
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:37,839
[Music]

96
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,598
well and some people you know hemp is

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,239
just another version of cannabis it's

98
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,878
all cannabis so marijuana and hemp are

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,719
two different legal definitions and I

100
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:48,039
won't get into the details of that but

101
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,759
I'm happy to explain it to anybody it is

102
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:51,519
technically the same plant split in two

103
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,280
different legal Parts flowers are

104
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,200
marijuana stock stems and seeds are hemp

105
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,000
but the same plant kind of produces all

106
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,119
those beneficial molecules so hemp

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,560
products are very beneficial that means

108
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,200
you could get them from the Cannabis

109
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,300
products that you have on the store in a

110
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,238
medical sense

111
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:10,040
[Music]

112
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,158
too so what are cannaboids so synthetic

113
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,598
cannaboids are things like spice we hear

114
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,719
bad things about those we don't want to

115
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,199
talk about those phyto canabo are the

116
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,720
ones that the plant makes so what's up

117
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,639
there on the screen are the canabo acids

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,560
these are the actual molecules that the

119
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,000
plant

120
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,959
makes you'll hear more about THC and CBD

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,959
but those are processed canabo you have

122
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,519
to heat the plants natural molecules

123
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,239
before you form the neutral canono in

124
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,918
THC or

125
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,478
CBD the the way the plant does this is

126
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,478
it takes two precursors lolic acid and

127
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,079
janal pyrro phosphate stitches them

128
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,360
together to make CBG acid which is the

129
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:50,560
common intermediate uh that the plant

130
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,600
utilizes to make its other cannaboids so

131
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,439
it depends what the genetics are and how

132
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,919
they're expressed but it will start with

133
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:00,120
CBG acid and go either to THC acid or

134
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:02,038
CBD acid sometimes CBC acid but we don't

135
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,079
see much of that uh in any of the plants

136
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:07,560
out here today you may see trace of CBG

137
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:09,758
acid depending upon how many copies of

138
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,360
the enzymes are there to produce THC

139
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,280
acid or CBD acid so those are all

140
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,280
different cannaboid markers that we can

141
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,079
watch and there are people working on

142
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:21,879
developing High CBG strains so it's not

143
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,599
converted to THC or CBD and there is

144
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,120
also interesting medical benefits from

145
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,120
that as

146
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,478
well so how do we go from the cannaboid

147
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,478
acids to the neutral canab oids it's a

148
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,279
process of heat and I'm often asked

149
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,639
what's the right temperature

150
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,918
theoretically it happens at every

151
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,519
temperature it will happen at room

152
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,839
temperature it just take till after

153
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,198
you're dead so it's a really long period

154
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,799
of time so that's the smartass answer

155
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,400
sorry about that one but the um most

156
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,520
effective temperatures are typically

157
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,918
boiling water we'll have uh have this

158
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,159
transformation happen in about 12 to 24

159
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,918
hours depending on exactly how you do it

160
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,919
so if you're sautéing butter at home

161
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,399
double boiler is probably the best way

162
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:03,079
and longer is typically better than not

163
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,719
um that is the the technical definition

164
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:08,399
of the process is called

165
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,400
decarbox so cannaboids are what most

166
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:14,159
people talk about but in 2011 we started

167
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,719
testing for tpin um and those are the

168
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,120
other things that make each of the

169
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,080
unique plant differences out there so

170
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,519
what we saw was three different plant

171
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,560
varieties all had the exact same canabo

172
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:26,478
profile the same amount of THC and next

173
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,439
to nothing else yet they gave very

174
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,120
different physiological responses they

175
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:32,000
smelled very different

176
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,120
something else is here causing this to

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,918
happen what was that and those are what

178
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,120
chemists called tpin so when we started

179
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,279
it was entertaining to me other labs so

180
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,319
they're just trying to charge you for

181
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,879
another test there's nothing useful

182
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,759
there um today I think it's one of the

183
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,478
more popularized words they call it

184
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,479
turpy or turp sauce or crazy things

185
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:53,839
around the word tpin and what we're

186
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,598
recognizing is that these are important

187
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,359
for um the Entourage effect so what

188
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:00,918
makes medical cannabis special and

189
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,319
different are these molecules also going

190
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:05,318
with the cannabinoids that really help

191
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,720
everyone benefit from the medicinal

192
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,879
power of cannabis this is just an

193
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,599
example of one of the profiles that we

194
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,039
provide and it's kind of like a chemical

195
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,800
fingerprint so you can see if the bars

196
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:17,759
are longer or shorter on different ones

197
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,478
and you can start to look at a label and

198
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,800
understand what medicine is going to be

199
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:23,719
of most interest to you as a patient so

200
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,160
it's additional information for

201
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,440
caregivers to provide or for patients to

202
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,840
understand which version of cannabis is

203
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,918
right for me it's not just THC and it's

204
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,159
not just the most THC it's not just CBD

205
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,279
either so single molecule isolates are

206
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,120
very very different you want as much of

207
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,598
a whole plant in your product as you can

208
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,759
get in the end and tpin are a key part

209
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:47,079
of

210
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,759
that but they're very very complex the

211
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,639
word tpine represents 20,000 different

212
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,598
chemical molecules in the plant kingdom

213
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,038
plants use them to talk to each other

214
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,199
they use that to talk to their

215
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,759
environment and they often use it to

216
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,478
ward off p through predators so

217
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,919
sometimes they're irritants right so

218
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:04,918
some people create an allergy to

219
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:06,598
cannabis because the plant saying leave

220
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,758
me alone I'm just this helpless little

221
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:11,079
thing standing here in the environment

222
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,639
they're not making them for our benefits

223
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:14,199
but more for their own benefit to

224
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,840
survive and thrive in their own

225
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,960
environment we're fortunate enough to be

226
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,239
able to harness them and utilize them

227
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,560
tpin can be used in things like tape and

228
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,360
they can be as complex as taxa which is

229
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,399
a breast cancer medicine that comes from

230
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,598
a Pacific UT tree so it's a a vast world

231
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:31,560
of chemistry and it's very fascinating

232
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,399
what we know is a little bit about

233
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,559
single molecules by themselves so what I

234
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,679
wrote up here is you know Pine has a

235
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,079
pine odor it may be useful as a Bronco

236
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,038
dilator so that might open the Airways

237
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,959
for an asthmatic if they were to inhale

238
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,559
some of that it may also increase

239
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,159
absorption and up the intake of THC

240
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,399
through your lungs so what we don't know

241
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,319
very well is how these things all work

242
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,480
together so just because I have a little

243
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,360
linu that may be sedative does not mean

244
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,120
this brain that has a little linol will

245
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,600
put me to sleep there might be other

246
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,799
things that counteract that there might

247
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,320
be other things that really change that

248
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,000
we don't know what the whole complex

249
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,560
picture looks like so I do believe tpin

250
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,360
hold the future in terms of tailoring

251
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,759
medicine for patients and really helping

252
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,839
them understand what's going to be the

253
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,879
right product for them but we cannot

254
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,680
make marketing claims of that type today

255
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,679
if someone says I really know the secret

256
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,679
sauce to telling you everything that's

257
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,599
too far ahead that's the cart in front

258
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,199
of the horse and drives the scientist

259
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,320
crazy but makes the marketing people

260
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,519
happy so I'm definitely on the other

261
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,600
side of

262
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,759
that so what we were able to do is take

263
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,560
both canono and tpine data and look on a

264
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,159
vast survey of thousands of different

265
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:43,879
strains over were 2,000 in this data set

266
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,919
and really start to compare them by

267
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,799
their chemical fingerprint and what we

268
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,838
wanted to see was what was different

269
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:52,039
about them like what are the names what

270
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,839
is Inda and sativa and what really makes

271
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,958
sense so what we found out was THC was

272
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,680
not the differentiator there's THC in

273
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,359
everything and it it averaged out to be

274
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:03,879
about 16 so we're seeing unfortunately

275
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,480
some Labs say that there's 30 even 40%

276
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,559
THC in a plant that's not happening

277
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,159
that's a bad lab so or they're doing the

278
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,359
math funny or they're not doing things

279
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,000
in an ethical fashion and if you're

280
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,720
going to extract that you'll find out

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,360
the hard way that you never got anything

282
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,200
out of that and it's not useful to a

283
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,480
patient to just say here's a lot of THC

284
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,360
it's what's the right product for me is

285
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,560
that produced in the same fashion every

286
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:31,320
single time so we had witnessed people

287
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,278
changing a name in a dispensary or what

288
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,800
I feel is immoral and unethical is to

289
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,759
say to an insomniac this indicia strain

290
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,199
will make you go to sleep how can you

291
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,799
make that claim and how can you tell

292
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,240
that individual that when you have no

293
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,359
idea if it's going to work for them that

294
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,759
way they go home they try cannabis

295
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,720
they're awake till 5: in the morning

296
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,240
they say cannabis is not right for me

297
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,240
and they think that all strains are the

298
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,039
same and now that person who could find

299
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,039
great benefits is unfortunately misled

300
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,360
and misdirected and thinks that cannabis

301
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,439
doesn't work for them that was a big

302
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,959
problem for me and I think it's

303
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,279
something that we need to clarify so

304
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,799
what this data shows in a bigger picture

305
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:09,278
is that in a perfect world if all those

306
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,159
claims are right we'd see sativa hybrid

307
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,799
and indica what we see is this Continuum

308
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,399
and the smear and a bunch of stuff up on

309
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,599
the corner so all the colors together

310
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,600
here really indicate that you can't say

311
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,600
one Inda does this and a sativa does

312
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,519
that it really means each plants its own

313
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,800
unique version and that is a

314
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,879
morphological description of how long it

315
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,759
would take to do flowering or grow times

316
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,159
it's not indicative of what the medicine

317
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,399
is going to be like to that patient in

318
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,559
the

319
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,600
end um we took a smaller subset of that

320
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,759
with just five names at a time to try

321
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,240
and discern are there even tighter

322
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,679
groupings of those things and a small

323
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,680
study with Jack hair found at 30% of the

324
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,919
time it's misnamed but it's not even

325
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,159
Jack hair at all so it's a very distinct

326
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,159
chemical profile and you could see it

327
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,319
clearly in the data that it was misnamed

328
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,240
and abused and you'll see some of these

329
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,320
names cluster like harleyquinn because

330
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,360
it's so distinct and different but other

331
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,639
ones are are kind of all over the place

332
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,039
and you can't put much stock inside of

333
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,680
just the name you really have to know

334
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,639
who's doing it and

335
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,799
why the major tpine differentiators by

336
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,159
the way were terpinolene and Nal they

337
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,799
were the ones pulling Jack hair and

338
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:19,600
train wreck up to the top they prevent

339
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,799
in m and linol and lanine pulled things

340
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,040
to the right and this was a methodology

341
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,039
called principal component

342
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:31,359
analysis so what we saw with just four

343
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,120
names this was W Jack OG Kush and Sour

344
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,000
Diesel and we looked in California and

345
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,679
Washington that you see there is a

346
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,240
little bit of some of the clustering if

347
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,638
you look at it in 3D though you'll see

348
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,639
that it's kind of scattered and isn't

349
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,799
that great but what you'll notice was

350
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,000
something as popular as OG Kush it goes

351
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:49,519
across like the entire thing so who

352
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,639
knows which OG Kush you had so kush or

353
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,240
OG whatever good luck um you know it

354
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,000
maybe some person or some Cult of ours

355
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,519
are special to a certain dispensary that

356
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,278
might be something you can can rely on

357
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,480
but if you go to another state or you go

358
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,639
somewhere else and they say I have the

359
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,680
best OG cush around it's probably not

360
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,480
what you've seen here um and that is

361
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,958
important to a patient and to doctors

362
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,079
recommending those things so they know

363
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,439
what to consume and they can rely on

364
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,039
that right now we have no

365
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,560
standardization of the naming and really

366
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:19,278
what we need are producers or

367
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,359
cultivators if there are cultivators

368
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,320
here you can build a brand around

369
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,278
consistently producing the same product

370
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,839
every single time and putting your name

371
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,759
on your OG Kush so our effort would be

372
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,839
to authenticate that and validate that

373
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,360
you're doing that the same every time

374
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,800
you can then talk to doctors to

375
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,440
recommend that to certain types of

376
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:40,240
patients and we can kind of Advance the

377
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,240
ball down the field in terms of how we

378
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,560
can raise the level of play like and not

379
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
just call it whatever we want or a

380
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:49,000
flavor of the week it's not really going

381
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,000
to help anybody get to where we want to

382
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,039
go so there are there are an enormous

383
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,360
amount of product types that go along

384
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,879
with Canabis so what we've seen is

385
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,800
there's a a lot of different molecules

386
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,720
can be up to 200 that I've just talked

387
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,919
about in terms of tpin and cannabinoids

388
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,320
that you can see and then you have all

389
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,360
these product diversities so whether

390
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,839
it's just the flower material or if it

391
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,039
was some sort of trim that has very

392
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,360
different composition is it heat that

393
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:17,439
was pulled off of that and that

394
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,560
concentrations different or was it made

395
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,720
into an extract or a derivative product

396
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,799
for oral or sublingual use all of those

397
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,519
deliver different types of medicinal

398
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,039
benefits to different patients and you

399
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,519
have to understand what you're ingesting

400
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,039
in which manner to know if that's the

401
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,519
right medicine for

402
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:37,838
you so let's see so it's important to

403
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,759
understand how can this be variable or

404
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,079
the same so when you talk about

405
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,440
cultivation pushing that in the same

406
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,519
direction every single time you're

407
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,160
trying to control something natural and

408
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,759
wild its idea is to be diverse and not

409
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,838
consistent and uniform but it is doable

410
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,440
so controlling the temperature humidity

411
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,720
nutrient cycle lighting you know phase

412
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,160
of the moon we're not sure what they all

413
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,920
are but there are a lot of L of things

414
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:04,639
that go into making that reproducible

415
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,159
every single time and that is doable the

416
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,879
Dutch do it they've been doing it for

417
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,879
years it's just as a matter of

418
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,919
sophistication and paying attention to

419
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:13,879
the products that you produce when you

420
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,759
talk about an infused product it becomes

421
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,838
a little bit more different how is it

422
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,519
extracted what may or may not be left

423
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,839
behind was it fully DEC carboxilate or

424
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,959
not and what other you know molecules

425
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,480
might be present in the end extract or

426
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,799
are not present that were there from the

427
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,800
flower material that creates another

428
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:34,039
type of experience for the patients as

429
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:36,439
well so how am I consuming it is one how

430
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,078
is it made is another big one and anyone

431
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,800
looking to make products you just have

432
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,919
to keep doing the same thing every

433
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:43,519
single time so there are ways to

434
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,078
standardize your product and improve

435
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,039
your value and that's the best way to be

436
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,879
I'd say a provider of medicine to people

437
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:51,360
out here who would find benefits from it

438
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,240
don't change the formula don't do

439
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,800
something different once it works for

440
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,159
someone let them rely on that and then

441
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,559
you're going to be in far better shape

442
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,159
as a brand and the patients are going to

443
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:04,318
be better off too

444
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:06,360
so I've got um so which ways might you

445
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:08,559
consume that this is important for

446
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,039
doctors to understand and for patients

447
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,318
what's my consumption method flour

448
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,000
material and concentrates you can do via

449
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:18,159
you know combustion um vaporization is

450
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,919
becoming much much more popular the

451
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,600
vaporization is lower temperature less

452
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:24,799
destruction of certain molecules a

453
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,319
little bit more friendly to the airway

454
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,639
but it is the best way to ingest the the

455
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:31,120
molecules directly so it's kind of like

456
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,198
injecting them without having to go

457
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,318
through the needle process so you get

458
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,838
the right molecules in the bloodstream

459
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:39,639
directly sublingual does the same thing

460
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,000
it usually takes a couple extra minutes

461
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,959
but you'll get THC and CBD predominantly

462
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,318
in the bloodstream that way topicals not

463
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,078
so sure all of those are going through

464
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:49,559
the skin or if you're really getting a

465
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,359
good amount of that it may be more of a

466
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:53,399
surface action might help with

467
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,879
inflammation or arthritic types of pains

468
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,318
but it might not help you know head

469
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,759
pains depending upon what's going on

470
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:01,439
your concentration in the blood just

471
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:03,278
doesn't get that high oral Pro like

472
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,038
products though go through the liver

473
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,439
first so they go into the stomach

474
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,879
they're absorbed at different rates and

475
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,558
then the liver transforms that and makes

476
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,720
different molecules than just THC so it

477
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:14,639
actually makes the molecules that you

478
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,160
fail in your urine test if you're

479
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,799
driving um but that molecule that it

480
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,640
makes it's called 11 hydroxy THD is five

481
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:24,038
times more active at the canono 1

482
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,240
receptor it's a very different molecule

483
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:28,679
so even if I took the same amount in

484
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,798
inhaled or orally I could get two

485
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,160
drastically different responses I could

486
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,000
have two different side effects it's not

487
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,558
really THC that's doing the activity

488
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,160
when you take it orally nor CBD so

489
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,200
that's something the medical community

490
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,720
is not fully caught up on and a lot of

491
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,000
the research is not on those metabolites

492
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,720
unfortunately so but it's important that

493
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,319
if you're looking for what am I going to

494
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,839
get and how long is it going to last and

495
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,798
is this the right stuff for me that you

496
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,000
understand that there are some

497
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,720
differences and there's not one product

498
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,279
fits all for everyone it's a very

499
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,880
individualized thing

500
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:06,079
so we'll do so how the concentrate is

501
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,640
actually manufactured is a key part of

502
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,240
what goes on in terms of medical

503
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,440
cannabis products so you're seeing more

504
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,960
people say I have high Purity CBD or I

505
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,080
have high Purity THC well High Purity

506
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,480
THC is Marinol and we've already said

507
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,558
that that wasn't the best thing that we

508
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,480
want how do we keep it more like the

509
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,879
plan so there are a variety of like

510
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,919
extraction methods right dry sifting

511
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,159
water extraction for bubble has Co

512
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,080
hydrocarbon extractions ethanol

513
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:36,080
extractions all of those will form some

514
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,079
extract but all of those extracts are

515
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,798
very different and all of them have very

516
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,359
different compositions so most of the

517
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:44,558
time you've lost a lot of Turpin if I go

518
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,240
and winterize it where I add ethanol

519
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,519
make it cold filter that off and

520
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,240
evaporate the ethanol I've evaporated a

521
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,000
lot of tpin as well so I have no way of

522
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,038
controlling the product composition or

523
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,079
reproducibility of that it's just not

524
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,960
going to be the same every single time

525
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,480
I'm going to get some canabo base with a

526
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,440
little bit of fats or other stuff that

527
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,200
went with it it's going to be a very

528
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,360
different product than what you got off

529
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,798
the plant so there are people trying to

530
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,719
introduce tpin in different ways I think

531
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,960
that we'll see more and more of that uh

532
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,360
coming in the future but how you do that

533
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,480
which ones you have is it reproducible

534
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,879
and is it still safe to ingest I think

535
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,159
there still question marks that the

536
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,480
regulator is looking to catch up on but

537
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:26,520
we'll hopefully get broader diversity of

538
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,480
products out there and what we did was

539
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,440
we looked at concentrates in that same

540
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,880
fashion we did to all the strains and

541
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,000
you see that most of them are all the

542
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,520
same and really that's because they're

543
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,319
pretty much just the cannabinoids and

544
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,480
there's no tpin

545
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:41,158
left when you compare them with the

546
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,440
flowers you see that all the

547
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:43,919
concentrates are over here and the

548
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,360
flowers are over there so there's a

549
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,080
little bit of overlap and when you look

550
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,879
at it in 3D they're not on top of each

551
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:51,639
other but what that says is concentrate

552
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,600
products are a different type of product

553
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,280
than the flower product so the goal

554
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,399
should be how do I make the concentrate

555
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,639
products more like the flour products

556
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,360
and we're not we're not not seeing a

557
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,600
whole bunch of that just yet but I think

558
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:04,759
that that's that's coming this is an

559
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:07,199
important picture that you tells you I

560
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,038
don't want just any old concentrate I

561
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,919
want to really know what's the

562
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:13,960
composition of that concentrate it used

563
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,559
to be here is my goo don't you want to

564
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,440
buy it from me I'm sure there's a lot of

565
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:20,960
CBD or THC in there I think we're moving

566
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,558
past that we we certainly need to and

567
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,960
we're headed in a much better Direction

568
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,558
Where We could look at a broader scope

569
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,558
of molecules and understand this is what

570
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:33,240
a standardized product really is

571
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:34,918
um so in in terms of like understanding

572
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,038
for yourself as a patient if you're

573
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:40,120
providing for patients like how how was

574
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:42,240
this product formed what is the

575
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,639
homogeneity of that product in an edible

576
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,038
product so chocolate products are

577
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,080
excellent because it's easy to get the

578
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:50,119
THC distributed uniformly throughout it

579
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,279
if I have drink products or topical

580
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:53,759
products that are higher viscosities or

581
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:56,119
other types of products that don't mix

582
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,359
well like say cookie batter like do I

583
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:00,158
have a lump of my concentrated one part

584
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:02,678
did I cook it with the tray a little

585
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,080
crooked and now this brownie is twice as

586
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,000
thick as the other one making sure that

587
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,960
every single unit has the exact

588
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,400
concentration and has the exact same

589
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,480
size is going to be critical as

590
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,240
regulations come about so I did hear a

591
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,000
little bit the comment I don't like

592
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,679
regulation unfortunately I do um I would

593
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,558
say regulation is good in terms of

594
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,880
making sure we stay safe and within the

595
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,000
right bounds and give us clear

596
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,679
guidelines and rules to operate by if

597
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,319
they're too restrictive they're not good

598
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,240
if they don't exist then it's not good

599
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,599
as well cuz what we see today is a lot

600
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,519
of pesticide contaminations which no one

601
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,678
that's sick should be exposed to

602
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,400
unregulated products I can tell you that

603
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,440
with John's Hopkins researchers we

604
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,200
studied a broad diversity of infused

605
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,278
products 87% of them were not within the

606
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,400
label like spec that they put on the

607
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:49,480
product so you don't know what you're

608
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,320
getting 87% of the time when you orally

609
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,000
take this product thank God it doesn't

610
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:54,960
kill you but it's definitely not what

611
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,798
you're going to want and then it might

612
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,278
also not be that experience that someone

613
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,879
benefits from and therefore for they're

614
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:02,159
not going to be a cannabis consumer in

615
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,080
the future it's pretty simple to work

616
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,840
with a lab and have some tests to say

617
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm on point my products are definitely

618
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,798
consistent how do I make sure I've got

619
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,240
the same concentration in all my

620
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:13,639
products that's going to be the way that

621
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,919
your brand succeeds today and I think

622
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,000
that's kind of the important thing for

623
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:18,000
entrepreneurs out here to

624
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,400
remember so in summary what the

625
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,240
profiling tells us was the whole idea of

626
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,679
indiga sativa hybrid telling you a

627
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,079
physiological effect is a misnomer it

628
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,400
does not work that way so what specific

629
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,199
plant and which composition causes these

630
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,120
reactions for which types of patients we

631
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,558
don't know yet today but that's the way

632
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,959
that we have to look about those so

633
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,839
we're hoping to start a new dialogue and

634
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,919
a new way of classifying those to really

635
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:48,240
make it much easier to understand and

636
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,038
don't rely too much on the name um but

637
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,759
you can trust your nose there are ways

638
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,240
to say I know that this smells the same

639
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,359
as it did the last time it looks visibly

640
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,240
the same color I didn't get the bait and

641
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:00,399
switch I'm more likely to have it this

642
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,919
one if it's the same profile and it's

643
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,200
just more or less then you just need to

644
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,080
take less or more so it's not bad to

645
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,000
have it at a different concentration as

646
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:11,278
long as it's the same composition um and

647
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,720
what that profiling tells us is tpin are

648
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:16,400
really

649
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,079
important so um and this is the the part

650
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,400
that no one likes to talk about but this

651
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,558
is why regulations are important how do

652
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,320
we understand what's not on the product

653
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,038
so cannabis doesn't kill people but some

654
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,200
of the stuff that may go along with it

655
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,919
actually could so it's important know

656
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,159
that that's not there and when you have

657
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,600
patients who are immuno compromised or

658
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,120
you know undergoing chemotherapy

659
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,519
treatments or exceptionally weak and

660
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,719
frail they cannot afford to be exposed

661
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,480
to pesticide contaminations it's just

662
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,000
not it's not in their interest and it's

663
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,000
not good for anybody um what we kind of

664
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,798
looked at in this picture is there's uh

665
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,759
stop work orders in Washington and

666
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:55,278
Colorado but back in 200 end of

667
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:57,879
2012 we did a small study with a

668
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,798
handheld pipe and a glass water pipe as

669
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,200
as well both with and without the

670
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:04,240
filters that you see there which are

671
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,038
coconut carbon and cotton and what we

672
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,880
determined was rather alarming that we

673
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,558
looked at these molecules that are known

674
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,360
pesticides or cultivating agents that

675
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,359
are put on the plant ones a plant growth

676
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,879
regulator up to 70% of what we put on

677
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,119
the plant could be introduced into the

678
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,640
Airways and into your lungs so if you

679
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,479
are you know combusting and inhaling a

680
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,600
product that has pesticides or plant

681
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,079
growth Regulators on it you're literally

682
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,439
injecting those things right into your

683
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:32,319
bloodstream so we don't set daily intake

684
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,798
limits on vegetables because you're

685
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,879
inhaling them we set them because you're

686
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:37,759
orally ingesting them so there's an

687
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,840
absorption and there's a toxicity limit

688
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,158
that goes with that we don't have those

689
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,959
for inhal inhalation products in

690
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,440
cannabis so that was why we did the

691
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,679
study to see how much you could be

692
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,480
exposed for what you're looking at

693
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,120
getting that way and how do we set

694
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,640
regulations about when these things

695
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,558
should be applied and how much should be

696
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,399
there so it's important science that

697
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,558
needs to be done before we understand

698
00:24:56,398 --> 00:25:00,319
how we actually set the regulation

699
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,398
now that we know these kinds of things I

700
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:05,000
think more of The Regulators are saying

701
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:06,558
so how do I fix this problem what should

702
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,200
I or should I not allow on these

703
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:09,720
products and it is a matter of what am I

704
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,558
using the product for in the end and

705
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,240
which ones did I put on there

706
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:15,720
fortunately most of the Regulators are

707
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,240
going towards products that did not have

708
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,919
any intake limit thresholds things that

709
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,679
we've deemed exceptionally safe like

710
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,320
cinnamon oil or other types of natural

711
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,080
products that you don't have to worry

712
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,359
are you know harmful chemicals that

713
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,839
would be exposed to people so that's

714
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,719
starting to Trend in the right direction

715
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,240
but it's still going to be a little bit

716
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,759
longer I won't put a time frame on it

717
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,880
but it won't be tomorrow till that

718
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:40,000
problem's

719
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,320
fixed and our goal was absolutely like

720
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,038
how do I put this information on a label

721
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,599
how do I inform patients how do doctors

722
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,319
patient providers and patients

723
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:50,798
themselves get to understand what's in

724
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:53,119
their product so there's a variety of

725
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,558
different labels these two are flowers

726
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,398
and this one's an edible product but you

727
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:59,119
can see as as much information as we

728
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:00,359
could put put on there was was placed

729
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,879
there we modeled it after the

730
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,319
nutritional facts panel um we have one

731
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,240
of these on our website and you can

732
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,079
certainly download a large version and

733
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,919
it explains all the little components

734
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:11,439
and the different pieces that are there

735
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,320
but the goal is to Pro provide

736
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,320
information so with a label like that

737
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:17,158
you can say these are the top Turin I'm

738
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,960
used to seeing these are the product

739
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,399
types that are working for me no matter

740
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,000
what name you called it I still know

741
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:26,599
what I'm looking for as a

742
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,759
patient and

743
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:30,398
yeah for those of you who are really

744
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,278
sharp in looking at that label you'll

745
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:35,359
notice that it wasn't the simple sum to

746
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:39,519
say THC acid plus THC equals this amount

747
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:41,278
of Maximum THC available so it's um

748
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,759
based on molecular weight so you're

749
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,558
going to lose a CO2 molecule and THC

750
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,519
actually weighs less than THC acid so

751
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,558
there's a little algebraic equation that

752
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,639
I put up there it's pretty simple when

753
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:57,960
you think of it there's just 133% of the

754
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,880
weight is gone as CO2 so 100% THC acid

755
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,200
would be

756
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,640
87.7% THC and it's important to know if

757
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,919
you're a processor and you're looking to

758
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,759
say where' all my stuff go why did I

759
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,640
lose this weight it's supposed to you

760
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,278
know eliminate but it's important to

761
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,000
know how that math is done so that your

762
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:15,440
lab is giving you the right values that

763
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,119
you can look at and that you're kind of

764
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,880
comparing Apples to Apples when you're

765
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:22,158
looking at labels at a dispensary um so

766
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,559
I fortunately you can learn the math for

767
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,399
two molecules cuz CBD weighs exactly the

768
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,000
same so you only have to learn the math

769
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,678
once but it's um it it's pretty simple

770
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,480
and most of the labs should do that

771
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,960
right but we don't see them all do that

772
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,720
right so unfortunately you'll see other

773
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,798
labs just sum the numbers to make it

774
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,319
look larger that's to try and get the

775
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,519
marketing height behind that but it's

776
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,038
really not an accurate representation of

777
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:46,079
what you're going to get and won't lead

778
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:47,519
you to an accurate dose understanding or

779
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,158
dialogue with your

780
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,839
doctor

781
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,720
so um and really in general I hope I've

782
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,519
been impressed upon you that it's a very

783
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,038
complex world with cannabis I think

784
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,000
that's part of the fun and excitement of

785
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:01,359
it at least intellectually but it's part

786
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,319
of the challenge when you're a patient

787
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,798
trying to find the right product for you

788
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,759
or if you're a product producer or

789
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,079
patient provider how do I know which

790
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:10,879
products work for which patients we

791
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,480
really don't know today so I'd encourage

792
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,519
diversity and lots of different

793
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,480
creativity what product types that you

794
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,000
think are good what things you like to

795
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,240
see in them and really you know I I

796
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,319
would think that we're not going to hurt

797
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,679
ourselves with more product diversity

798
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,558
and it's about knowing that your

799
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,960
product's made consistently and that you

800
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,398
can educate about it and that's really

801
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,840
the the bottom line I think in the

802
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,479
end and and basically that's that's all

803
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:35,349
I have for tonight and thank you guys

804
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,480
very much for your

805
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:38,480
[Applause]

806
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:49,599
[Applause]

807
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:52,158
attention thank you so um I'm a lawyer

808
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,639
and I represent people who own

809
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,440
processing companies and whatnot up in

810
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,278
the state of Washington okay I've been

811
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,159
also asked to represent K in um

812
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:07,038
California the question I have is I I

813
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,399
don't entirely come from this sector but

814
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:13,879
I know that we're seeing almost um a

815
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:17,439
deregulation up in the state of wash

816
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:20,559
with um medical marijuana being

817
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,240
eliminated as its own class and it's now

818
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,240
being sold in the same place as the

819
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,880
recreation not yeah you're seeing a

820
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,798
transition where they're folding the two

821
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,840
systems together so medical will be

822
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,599
folded into the recreational system and

823
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:34,678
they'll be through the same stores then

824
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:36,359
same dispensaries in the end but you'll

825
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,919
charge the patient differently based on

826
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,798
their medical status that's correct

827
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:43,399
however with this trend and with the

828
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:46,319
fact that you're talking about uh

829
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:51,359
products medicines that have very

830
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:53,319
specific remedy uh uh what's goals

831
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,398
whether it's an inflammation or cancer

832
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,319
or whatever are you seeing at this point

833
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,719
along the west coast poast with

834
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,720
California Oregon Washington are you

835
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,798
seeing sufficient analysis similar to

836
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:11,240
non-cannabis products to understand the

837
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:14,278
medicinal nope consistency no no simply

838
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,798
no no we see very inacurate testing they

839
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:18,038
don't have the labs regulated well

840
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:19,759
enough especially in Washington three

841
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:21,839
Labs have folded up in Washington

842
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:24,440
because of what's going on up there and

843
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:27,599
the regulator has not regulated the labs

844
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,000
to be accurate so you cannot get good

845
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,038
information about your product with an

846
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,798
inaccurate lab and you can't know any

847
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,879
medicinal benefits from that if you

848
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,398
don't go further and then we really

849
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,720
should not be making claims whatsoever

850
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:42,158
even if we are working with a good lab

851
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,240
it just doesn't work out medicine well

852
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,200
you can get good standardized medicine

853
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,120
if it's clean and it's the right one for

854
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,880
you but it is a little bit of a patient

855
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,158
has to kind of figure out which one's

856
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,360
right for them based on a dialogue with

857
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,919
people around them so it is trial and

858
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,119
error and that's all that we're left

859
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,880
with as the best for today there's no

860
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:02,359
this is going to work for that I don't

861
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,519
it may work for that most likely it

862
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,199
could but it's not a guarantee that's

863
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,679
the best that you can do and I'm not a

864
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,240
lawyer but so my question is in relation

865
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,399
to previous question too what are the

866
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:19,880
Dutch doing to um to stabilize it and

867
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,398
make it more consistent what we do us

868
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,320
okay yeah so the question is what what

869
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:25,119
are the Dutch doing that is different so

870
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:26,678
theirs is a federally regulated

871
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:29,599
medicinal chemist like medicinal

872
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:31,480
cannabis program the cultivation of that

873
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:34,278
is standardized like a pharmaceutical

874
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,880
product so the cultivator had to prove

875
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:38,240
that it was consistent and the same

876
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,080
every time within a very narrow window

877
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,720
they over pressurize the rooms the

878
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,119
methodologies they use to clone and

879
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,839
propagate are different than what we're

880
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:48,319
doing and they religiously tested and

881
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:51,480
made sure that it was the same every

882
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,439
single time so it was I mean expensive

883
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,639
facility was kind of one way of looking

884
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,679
at it it's not cheap to build that but

885
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:59,678
they tested where were the lights how

886
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,440
high were they in the room was the Lumen

887
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,679
difference the same across all the

888
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,480
plants and was I really really

889
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,038
accurately repeatedly doing good

890
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,599
agricultural practices GMP style for

891
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:12,158
plants that I made sure it was the same

892
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:14,199
time that it was water the same amount

893
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,919
of water the same type of water the same

894
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,679
nutrients all the same for each specific

895
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,240
cultivar so it's doable it's just a lot

896
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,240
of diligence and a lot of work but it's

897
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:29,079
doable so sure yeah one more lucky

898
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,079
question

899
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,808

[Applause]

901
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:44,879
yeah our testing service you know offers

902
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,599
the labels as part of the testing for

903
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,600
sure

904
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,558
yep thank you thank je what a great talk

905
