1
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:23,629
yeah so I guess the key is to pay

2
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:25,490
attention right you get that a percent

3
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:26,500
terpene strain and you don't know why

4
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:30,109
it's a bummer

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:33,320
[Laughter]

6
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:36,710
cool so on data collection to be able to

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,090
understand what our purpose is you know

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,378
a lot of people come in to and say I

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,710
just want to grow a ton of weed

10
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:44,359
well I mean you know okay well I want to

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,890
I want to grow this type and I want to

12
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:47,570
grow this well you got to kind of

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,549
understand what your focus is you know

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,549
and focus is a hard thing for some of us

15
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:58,189
exactly

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,170
so really really one of the one of the

17
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:01,699
highest benchmarks to really aim for is

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,590
the pre-planning right because this is

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,269
the phase that really tells us what our

20
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,740
business model is and what we're trying

21
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,349
to build for the market that we're

22
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:10,670
trying to produce for the the plants

23
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:12,949
that we're trying to grow and cultivate

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,960
for that production method and how we're

25
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,880
actually even going to do it down to the

26
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,859
what is my facility going to look like

27
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,719
Who am I going to hire for it and so

28
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:22,280
pre-planning is one of those steps in

29
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,010
the process that kind of gets overlooked

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,409
when creating the business model it's

31
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,000
it's easy to it easy to get 40 million

32
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:30,560
and throw it into a huge project but

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,299
without knowing and understanding what

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,150
you're actually trying to achieve it's a

35
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:36,650
lot of waste of money and so let's start

36
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,469
over here with Anya what kind of things

37
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:43,189
in the pre-planning realm that you see

38
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:44,810
are kind of an often mistake and things

39
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:47,239
that people can do to kind of help

40
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:52,310
mitigate that that risk at the beginning

41
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:59,929
oh I feel like that's a minefield of a

42
00:01:52,310 --> 00:02:01,879
question right there I think from an

43
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,509
example standpoint one of the biggest

44
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,890
mistakes that people make is expecting

45
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,979
that they can have a budget without a

46
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,719
plan so you say you can throw 40 million

47
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,519
dollars into a huge project and if you

48
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:15,289
have no plan you can be forty million

49
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:19,219
dollars in and not two-thirds of the way

50
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:23,298
through the project so not understanding

51
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:27,109
that there actually has to be a plan to

52
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:28,730
determine a process and a budget is I

53
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,620
think mistake number one

54
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:33,829
the number of people that come to

55
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:37,189
that say we have a building we want to

56
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:40,209
build out X Y Z they've got a drawing on

57
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:42,829
a napkin how much is it gonna cost me

58
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,719
it's gonna cost you anywhere from two

59
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:48,950
hundred thousand dollars to ten million

60
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:52,039
dollars so like if that's the starting

61
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:55,039
point and the expectation is that you're

62
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:58,400
gonna get anywhere within a reasonable

63
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:01,429
range to be able to make a plan you're

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,510
already in the weeds and I swear I

65
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:09,500
didn't mean that as a joke the planning

66
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:13,159
has to happen on the project and the

67
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:16,209
development before you even get to how

68
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:19,180
much is this gonna cost me and if you

69
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:24,920
don't do it in that order

70
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:27,590
you will ultimately wind up not seeing a

71
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,828
return and you will ultimately wind up

72
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,479
failing before you even start so there

73
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:34,219
are many other things that I could speak

74
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:39,318
to about that but I'm gonna stay with

75
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:43,009
that one yeah so I could speak on this

76
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:45,708
for a minute as well you know for from

77
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:51,469
for me in sort of environmental control

78
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:53,930
HVAC world what we see is the biggest I

79
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:56,150
don't know lack of understanding is how

80
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,150
much it's gonna cost to control the

81
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,480
environment in your greenhouse or your

82
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,549
warehouse and you know I think that you

83
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,429
know speaking of squirrels is that we

84
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:10,040
get so growers get so focused on certain

85
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,260
technologies it could be lighting or it

86
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:15,739
could be a Hydra pannu hydroponic system

87
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:18,079
or a new automation system and they

88
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,418
forget about the other pieces and how

89
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,660
all those pieces will integrate together

90
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:26,299
and people come up with very unrealistic

91
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,330
budgets especially for environmental

92
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,650
control and you know we had a project

93
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:32,149
once where they were gonna spend a

94
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:34,699
hundred thousand dollars on the latest

95
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:36,529
LED technology twenty-five thousand

96
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,389
dollars on sensors are gonna put sensors

97
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:41,029
everywhere and five thousand dollars on

98
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:42,348
an HVAC system and I'm just like what

99
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:44,679
are you gonna control with all your

100
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,680
sensor

101
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,439
you know when it comes to greenhouses

102
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,839
versus warehouses even is where is the

103
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,279
best location where are you located you

104
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,469
know if if you know where you're gonna

105
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,899
be located does it make more sense to

106
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,570
have an open greenhouse it could be a

107
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:03,370
high tunnel right cold flame cold frame

108
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,110
greenhouse because you have good breezes

109
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,090
and you have a pretty mild climate and

110
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,220
you just want some protection and some

111
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:12,129
light depth but if you're in a harsher

112
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,580
climate you know do you need a closed

113
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:17,379
greenhouse and if you do that's you know

114
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:20,169
150 dollars a square foot type of

115
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:22,269
greenhouse this is not a cold frame $5 a

116
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,400
square foot greenhouse and don't split

117
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:28,209
the difference either because it's

118
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:30,459
pretty expensive so for me its budget is

119
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:33,219
you know growers under having a

120
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:35,560
realistic budget about what their

121
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:39,520
facility or their greenhouse is going to

122
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,530
to look like in the end so you know kind

123
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,569
of going back to the question of you

124
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:44,079
know initial planning stages and things

125
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:46,959
like that

126
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,240
you know obviously there are a lot of

127
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,329
ways to skin a cat is one of the sayings

128
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:56,680
that I like to use and so you know

129
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:59,889
understanding one what your model is is

130
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,250
probably helpful you know and given that

131
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:05,349
you know the cannabis industry and and

132
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,389
regulations and you know things are

133
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:10,030
moving quite rapidly you know my

134
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:13,779
suggestion would be that whatever you

135
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:16,359
plan on plan on it being lean and plan

136
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:19,839
on it being nimble you know if you go in

137
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,490
big and heavy and hard and front-load at

138
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,729
all and you're like we're just gonna

139
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:28,120
crush it we're gonna see such crazy

140
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,920
returns and you miss out on some of the

141
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,680
pieces that you know pre-planning like

142
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,270
well we didn't invest into an on-site

143
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,699
extraction we didn't put that in our

144
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:39,490
model because we're we're gonna grow all

145
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,610
a great flower you know not recognizing

146
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,019
that like a much better model would be

147
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,900
incorporating that potentially waste

148
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:49,930
stream into the overall profitability of

149
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:51,639
the business and so you know that's

150
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,168
that's just sort of a tid but I'm sure

151
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,399
all of us could go on you know the

152
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:56,558
mistakes that have been made and the

153
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,938
money wasted but you know pre plan

154
00:06:56,559 --> 00:07:05,199
where's the electricity coming from

155
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:08,949
right yeah it can be pretty dynamic and

156
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,319
as we see it's rapidly evolving I came

157
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,899
from the organ market and I'm sure we've

158
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,778
all heard about kind of the challenges

159
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:20,048
in the evolution that that market has

160
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:21,939
taken and if anything that showed us all

161
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:24,338
that we have to just be ready and

162
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:26,979
available to adapt to the circumstances

163
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:28,928
but there is there is a certain level of

164
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:30,818
pre thought and understanding now that

165
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:32,498
we know these certain markets are this

166
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:33,999
way you wouldn't move into Oklahoma and

167
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:35,799
expect it to just be the most amazing

168
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:37,659
thing it's going to be a challenge so

169
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:39,968
knowing what your local legislature has

170
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:42,488
to offer and the potential changes that

171
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:45,598
might come is really important to bring

172
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:48,188
into that pre-planning phase I also just

173
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,468
capitalized on on what you said being

174
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:54,489
nimble and being ready to change I think

175
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:55,959
is huge and recognizing to the what Nadi

176
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:58,478
you and I were speaking about earlier

177
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:01,838
that none of these changes are changing

178
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:04,718
a wall color so when the company that

179
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:06,699
you based your design off of starts

180
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:08,498
having all sorts of manufacturing

181
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,379
problems with your fixtures and you

182
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:12,429
decide to go with a different fixture

183
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,789
you're starting all the way back from

184
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:18,548
the beginning everything changes every

185
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:22,149
single aspect of your facility changes

186
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:24,008
by one tiny little seemingly

187
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:29,228
insignificant change of a piece of

188
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:31,209
equipment and recognizing that yes

189
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:33,028
you're gonna have to be prepared to do

190
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,740
that because technology is changing

191
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:37,750
every other day new stuff is coming out

192
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,120
companies are coming up companies are

193
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:44,168
falling down people are failing we are

194
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,389
learning constantly and very often we

195
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:49,928
suggest to people that they phase a

196
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:53,169
project instead of going all in all out

197
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:55,899
right from the beginning yeah absolutely

198
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:57,458
and another one of those aspects of that

199
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:59,318
is actually the design of the facility

200
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:01,958
itself so you understand your business

201
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:03,698
model somewhat you understand the road

202
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,338
path on where you're going you've

203
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:09,509
started to bring in the team that can

204
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:12,120
design this system for you

205
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:13,799
now you understand how am I gonna lay

206
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,690
this out whether it be a greenhouse

207
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,149
whether it be an indoor facility how am

208
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,220
I gonna lay this out what does the law

209
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:23,879
in my state require what am I allowed to

210
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,550
do what are my limitations there's a lot

211
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,129
of retrofit designs there's a lot of new

212
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:31,409
construction designs so maybe let's kind

213
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:33,629
of go into some of the differences in in

214
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:36,419
in the actual implementation of the

215
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:38,009
design for retrofit compared to a brand

216
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:42,659
new build and some of the challenges

217
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:47,519
that have you've seen comparatively in

218
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:50,399
in in a nutshell well I could say I've

219
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,799
had the misfortune perhaps of dealing

220
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,799
with a lot more retrofits and pre-built

221
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,528
facilities than you know the ideal fresh

222
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:01,078
build that being said you know I think

223
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:04,350
it's yeah right it's pretty important

224
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:05,519
too you know once you're have some some

225
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,528
clear understanding of what you're

226
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,730
working with it's pretty important to

227
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:11,039
understand the limitations of that

228
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,870
system you know again back to kind of

229
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,539
what the model is and and what what

230
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,909
you're striving to produce you know if

231
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:19,860
you have hoop houses at 4,000 square

232
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,939
feet certainly don't have a model where

233
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,068
you think you're going to produce year

234
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,639
round right you know if you have a

235
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:28,019
greenhouse in the desert you know

236
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,419
understand that you're going to use a

237
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,889
lot of water for pad cooling you know

238
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,419
and you're going to use a significant

239
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:35,730
amount of power to run those fans all

240
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:38,490
the time and so you know it's really in

241
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,159
the minutia that that the efficiency is

242
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,769
found and you know until you continue to

243
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:47,039
you know amass more data and understand

244
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:50,009
what those data points can be you know

245
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,500
you're you're only making as much

246
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:55,318
progress as as what you can sort of

247
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,850
analyze and capture in that way and on

248
00:10:55,318 --> 00:11:00,000
that I just want to add - we don't want

249
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,649
to leave out the you know the the

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,879
outdoor scaping is well - because

251
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:05,490
there's a lot of situations where you

252
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:09,389
come into a previously used farm or a

253
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,919
previously used just a spot of land and

254
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:12,600
you have to make something of it - so

255
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:17,729
let's not let's not forget about the

256
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:19,350
rich as far as the land goes so I'm

257
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,550
actually that's actually what I was

258
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:25,430
going to speak to not just land

259
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:27,469
buildings as well if we're talking

260
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:30,339
retrofit of a space not not just

261
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:34,540
necessarily retrofit of an existing farm

262
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:37,790
what was that space used for before and

263
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:39,919
we are seeing it and it comes back to

264
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:41,539
planning in terms of understanding where

265
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,329
is it actually most efficient for you to

266
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:46,219
land right for a long time everybody

267
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,330
wanted to go out agriculturally because

268
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,220
that was going to be the cheapest

269
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,810
because land was inexpensive property

270
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,970
was inexpensive you had a lot of space

271
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:55,909
you had a lot of options well as it

272
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,740
turns out there is not an extensive

273
00:11:55,909 --> 00:12:00,409
electrical grid out in agricultural

274
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:05,779
territory because we didn't farm this

275
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:08,750
way we had not massive electrical usage

276
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:11,899
on farms and so what people learned

277
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:13,519
after the fact I may say is that as it

278
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,169
turned out it was going to cost them

279
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,990
four hundred thousand dollars to bring

280
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:20,870
enough electricity to their facility so

281
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:24,200
ok now everybody wants to go in an urban

282
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:26,120
environment but buildings and rent are

283
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,330
really expensive so we're gonna find a

284
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,759
previously used car lot and we are going

285
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:35,180
to dump a bunch of green houses on that

286
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:38,029
car lot Wow what's the remediation

287
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:41,299
question there what are the other

288
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:44,120
facilities around you doing in a highly

289
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:46,669
urban industrial environment and how

290
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,519
does that impact the product that you're

291
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:51,979
producing coming out of that environment

292
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,860
so what mitigations do you need to put

293
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,950
in place in order to make that retrofit

294
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,779
safe and effective for the business that

295
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,990
you are now going to be operating in

296
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,990
there

297
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,419
you
