1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,139
[Music]

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:14,039
so um the amount the the temperature and

3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:16,799
the amount of dissolved oxygen are two

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,679
big factors that dictate the rate of

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,439
multiplication of life in the tea right

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,039
yeah depend temperature um yeah those

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,960
are the two biggest factors that and

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,960
what you started off with um so it's uh

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,840
having kind of a clean slate for them

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,120
usually when I'm starting te's I'll be

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,719
measuring three things I'll be I'll be

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:41,199
measuring the PPM the total dissolved um

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,160
particulate that's in that and uh I'll

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,359
be measuring ideally dissolved oxygen

15
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,119
and temperature of the water and um the

16
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,960
the

17
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:54,000
temperature you know has has a huge role

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,198
to play in that it's uh it's you know

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,759
biology in 80° water is going to

20
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,358
explode uh you know 50° water it's going

21
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,599
to

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,558
just just like a person you're not going

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,400
to be moving very far very fast if it's

24
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:11,158
3et of snow and 20° outside but if

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,280
you're you know in the tropics and hot

26
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,320
and humid well you probably wouldn't be

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,840
moving as fast as but you know if you

28
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:19,399
have a nice comfortable day where it's

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,759
you know 60 something and and a light

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,478
Breeze then you know you're going to be

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,000
able to run a marathon totally and that

32
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:28,200
brings up a good point too in that the

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,438
temperature and the ppms both have a

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,920
direct correlation effect to dissolved

35
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,839
oxygen so if temperature is too high

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,359
your dissolved oxygen potential of what

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,680
you can actually reach hits a ceiling at

38
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:43,118
80° you can't reach the same dissolved

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,280
oxygen level that you can at 65° and the

40
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:48,118
same thing with ppms you said to start

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,840
off a clean slate so a clean slate means

42
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:51,640
there's plenty of room for dissolved

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,680
oxygen and there's plenty of room for

44
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,879
biology to grow but as you add food

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,320
sources in there and you add your ppms

46
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,078
of say a fish Emulsion as a food source

47
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,798
for your biology if you had too much of

48
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,239
it then there's no room for the life to

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,000
grow and there's no the dissolved oxygen

50
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,840
levels come down as the ppms go up also

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,120
so you want to make sure there's a

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,280
balance there of the right temperature

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,200
and the right ppms or your dissolved

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,239
oxygen level won't be able to get high

55
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,359
enough that's so a lot of the best te's

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,280
that I personally have created over the

57
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:27,640
years are based on kind of that less is

58
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:30,080
more type mentality too um and really

59
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,159
kind of one of the one of the resources

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,280
for me in getting started in all this

61
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:39,878
was was Dr Lingham was the soyo food web

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,800
and you can find that online and um I I

63
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:46,199
absolutely um love everything that she

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,640
has you know she to me is one of the um

65
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,878
kind of founders of this whole practice

66
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,559
one of one of the originals and and the

67
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:56,000
the stuff that she has

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,840
done um was was really what got me kind

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,519
of interested in it and then pursuing

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,560
you know was kind of the mentality that

71
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,959
I had as I started to you know Branch

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,318
out and try and learn a little bit more

73
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,878
because she she does tend to lean on you

74
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,439
know she almost takes a don't to

75
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:13,399
anything type of approach um you know

76
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,359
very very light hands when it comes to

77
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,959
uh manipulating soil ecosystems from

78
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,799
from her line from uh from from her

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,598
mentality whereas for us with cannabis

80
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,879
you know we we can hit the throttle a

81
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,079
little bit harder and it does have a

82
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:31,759
direct effect on yield and this stuff is

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,760
all about you know

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,959
medicine absolutely but you know yield

85
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:41,238
is is everything for us and uh yield and

86
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,519
product quality so we we can manipulate

87
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:48,680
a lot of that stuff a little bit safely

88
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,400
but generally speaking less is more um I

89
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,319
have created better I have created More

90
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,360
explosively Alive te's using really

91
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,000
minimal

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,120
input

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,799
um far more than using you know some of

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,480
some of the products you might buy where

95
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
you use them at at their full

96
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,759
recommended dose and what you end up

97
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,239
what you end up with is a solution that

98
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,479
has some bacteria in it but it also has

99
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,759
a whole lot of fish and a whole lot of

100
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,399
kelp and a whole lot of humic that isn't

101
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,159
necessarily being utilized just yet

102
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,039
whereas the purpose of the compost te is

103
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,360
not necessarily to you can use this as a

104
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,840
mixing tank for fertilizer if you want

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,919
to but really the purpose of the the tea

106
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,799
practice or Brewing compost teas is uh

107
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,279
for me more about the biology like that

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,240
other stuff is a separate practice so

109
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:37,839
the biology is one part of it and then

110
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,079
the foods that you might introduce to

111
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,439
this last minute right before you put it

112
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,038
out okay then then we're to start you

113
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,360
know then we're walking in different you

114
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:47,199
we're talking a little bit different

115
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,319
game we're talking about a feeding

116
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:54,680
regiment not biology whereas the the

117
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:56,360
term compost te in a lot of cases in our

118
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,038
industry you know I mean our industry

119
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,280
does have a lot of kind of misused terms

120
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:02,719
you know like

121
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:04,519
um you know Master grower is actually a

122
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,199
certification it's not something that

123
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,439
you just say oh I've been growing canab

124
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,038
I'm a master grower no that's actually a

125
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,079
certification that people go through and

126
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:14,038
you'll find that people that um are

127
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,240
taking care of very complicated uh

128
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:19,038
botanical gardens with thousands of

129
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,319
species that's generally a master grower

130
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,839
um so it's just kind of that that term

131
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,400
compos T tends to kind of be this

132
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,239
all-encompassing thing where you know

133
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,959
anybody that's using this kind of

134
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,720
mentality well it's all considered comp

135
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:35,439
te and for me compos te is more about

136
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,680
the biology specifically and then you

137
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:41,279
can combine that with fertilizers with

138
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,759
nutrition with Plant Nutrition and

139
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,399
obviously they're not only compatible

140
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,479
but they're in a direct relationship so

141
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,879
they kind of get tossed in the same boat

142
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,399
a lot but uh yeah I tend to take the

143
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,120
less more it's almost like the t is

144
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:57,318
creating the army of helpers to help the

145
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,079
The Roots break down what the part two

146
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,560
is which is the nutrients you would then

147
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,599
introduce into the yeah environment and

148
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,079
so if you're using Nutri that are easily

149
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,360
broken down by the biology in my

150
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,198
experience it's a little more beneficial

151
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,120
to divide them up do one that's all

152
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,879
biology or almost entirely biology and

153
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,560
then you can I mean you can even use the

154
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,000
Brewing you know you can even use the

155
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,759
tea tank to do it but then you brew up

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,959
your nutrients or you know mix up your

157
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,520
nutrients and put those on um you know

158
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,239
and then obviously there's a timing

159
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,839
factor with there too and that well do

160
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
you want to lay down the food and then

161
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,638
introduce the biology to it or do you

162
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,758
want to introduce the biology and then

163
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,519
put the food in a lot of that comes down

164
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,000
to what kind of rates are you using how

165
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:41,519
fast are you trying to do it um because

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,319
the idea behind a lot of this is to keep

167
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,918
that soil ecosystem as stable as

168
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
possible because that to me is where a

169
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,079
lot of when things get thrown out of

170
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,840
balance in the ecosystem that's what

171
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,038
leaves the door open for things like

172
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,318
pathogens to come in whereas if you have

173
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,800
a like like you we kind of talk a little

174
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,919
bit about that jungle mentality if

175
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,079
you've got a a jungle where you know the

176
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,598
hunters come through and they pick off a

177
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,159
bunch of the Predators then you have an

178
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,959
explosion of you know versus a healthy

179
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,400
jungle that has never been touched and

180
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,000
everything is kind of in Balance well

181
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,598
anytime you throw

182
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,120
in anything from the outside you're

183
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:20,199
throwing that out of balance a little

184
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,759
bit so as little as you can throw those

185
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,879
things out of balance and that includes

186
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,598
like your your feeding rates you know I

187
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,400
mean for me nutrition specifically they

188
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:32,560
a lot a lot of the nutrient companies

189
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,318
will tell you you know feed this stuff

190
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,918
at full strength but then every every

191
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:40,400
other watering you have to use

192
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,680
water why because there's an excess of

193
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,318
stuff in there and you have to rinse it

194
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,199
out in order to introduce new stuff to

195
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,598
it when hold on a second I just put it

196
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,960
in there on purpose and now I'm rinsing

197
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:53,038
it out so I can add more uh a lot of

198
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,279
that mentality is coming from they want

199
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,079
to sell you nutrients whereas if you

200
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,839
introduce that stuff in a very light

201
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:02,598
amount all the time what you're

202
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:05,318
mimicking is rain coming down through a

203
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:08,360
healthy compost layer washing down a

204
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,560
relatively consistent amount of these

205
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,080
things down into the soil to where the

206
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,478
soil is never really thrown way out of

207
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,918
whack um different parts of the Year

208
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:18,199
obviously you go through the winter it's

209
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:19,598
going to affect the biology and you're

210
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,800
going to end up with it in the spring

211
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,680
you're going to end up with like kind of

212
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,520
that new flush of of uh of nutrients

213
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,199
down to the soil and they get used up at

214
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:31,318
different rates but really for me

215
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,038
keeping it balanced is about using

216
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,000
minimal input and in using minimal input

217
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,360
you can do it consistently you can do it

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,120
all the time and if you're doing it all

219
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,080
the time you can actually have a little

220
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,959
bit more direct relationship with what

221
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,160
effect that's having on the plant um

222
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,039
because with a lot of this stuff mean if

223
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,000
you hit if you hit these plants with you

224
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,639
know

225
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,440
1600 full dose of something yeah you're

226
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,559
going to see a a bang of a result but

227
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,040
then if you try and do that repeatedly

228
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,759
you're not going to see the same result

229
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,278
whereas if you feed things a little bit

230
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,159
at a time slowly over time what you'll

231
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:09,200
see is a much more natural kind of cycle

232
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,360
whereas those other Cycles will Spike U

233
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,920
you know when when you're spiking the

234
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,839
nutrients and a lot of that stuff is

235
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,039
either a insoluble which means not

236
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:21,160
readily available to the plant which is

237
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:24,639
why you have to rinse it out or uh you

238
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,600
know the plant's not able to take up the

239
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,958
the the even the soluble stuff there's

240
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,040
so much of it in a lot of what we tend

241
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,078
to feel from the kind of common

242
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,679
fertilizer regiments there's so much of

243
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:37,719
it in there the plant can't use it which

244
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,799
is again why you get back to that meing

245
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,560
to flush it out of the

246
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:45,359
system um so I tend to lean towards

247
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,879
having everything available on a light

248
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,240
scale and then if I want to bump that up

249
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,720
during certain periods you know if you

250
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,320
want to bump up nitrogen a little bit

251
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,560
here and then you want to you know bring

252
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,160
the nitrogen down a little bit while

253
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,759
you're increasing you know again NPK

254
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:03,159
through that cycle so you know

255
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:06,399
NPK or n and then p and then K I would

256
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,838
tend to lean more towards this rather

257
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,919
than

258
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,480
this and that's a lot easier to do if

259
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:16,199
you're um just feeding things light and

260
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,440
you're kind of dividing up those two you

261
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,200
know the food and the tea are definitely

262
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,480
separate entities although they

263
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,200
generally are thrown into the same term

264
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,159
compos so what what would be the

265
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,759
frequency of T feeding like we we talked

266
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,519
about about those three scenarios right

267
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:36,639
like one cocktail that would be more

268
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:40,360
conducive to uh you know new clone put

269
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:43,639
into the sterile grow media uh are you

270
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,759
doing that just once like on initial

271
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,600
transplant it really depends on your

272
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,000
media so if you have a sterile media

273
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,360
that's not necessarily going to support

274
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,720
these things you introduce this whole

275
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,159
ecosystem into a

276
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,560
desert um it's not going to last very

277
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,958
long and it's going to end there's going

278
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,359
to be certain species that will become

279
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,919
dominant very fast and a lot of the

280
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,320
other ones won't be able to compete or

281
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,159
will not have their preferred uh Foods

282
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,639
or ecosystem that and they'll start to

283
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:13,039
die off um with something like an

284
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,480
organic an organic base blend that's

285
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,559
been commercially bashed and it's just

286
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,720
not very broken down generally you don't

287
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,359
have to do it that that often I tend to

288
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,800
hit it pretty

289
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,839
hard you know at first just to get

290
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,199
everything established but then if you

291
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,600
just kind of let everything reach a

292
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,959
natural equilibrium you taper off a

293
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,200
little bit if you're using a sterile

294
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:40,439
media um obviously that's not going to

295
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,680
support that that life and so um you

296
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,760
know you're going to introduce it and

297
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,439
it's not really going to have much to

298
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,958
feed on except in a lot of cases

299
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,639
synthetic nutrients unless you're doing

300
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,719
something you know really organic again

301
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,879
is another term that you know there's

302
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,200
all kinds of different what is true

303
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,679
organic versus what is Omri certified or

304
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,000
different things and so if you're

305
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:01,000
introducing you know nutrients that will

306
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,360
keep biology alive on a regular basis

307
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,958
and and trying to keep that biology

308
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:11,240
stable um doesn't always work out and

309
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,559
and uh um so for me it kind of depends

310
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,919
on what media you're using if you're

311
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,479
using if you're using a rich like

312
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:19,958
backyard compost then you're not using

313
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,519
this to do anything at all what you're

314
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,439
doing is taking that stuff and rinsing

315
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,240
it in here to use it somewhere

316
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,560
else so on that level the ecosystem is

317
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,839
there it's established it's healthy and

318
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,958
you don't really need to do much to it

319
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,839
at all whereas if you're using something

320
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,039
that's like pure cocoa well you've got

321
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,959
these these materials the nutrients that

322
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,360
you're putting into the soil and

323
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:42,599
building up um it's a good idea in my my

324
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,800
experience I believe I've seen results

325
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,839
you know again not a biologist and how

326
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,399
do you test this stuff in these type of

327
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,040
environments you know I'm not in a

328
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,879
laboratory

329
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,198
so um in those type of in those type of

330
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,439
situations it's something where you

331
00:12:55,198 --> 00:13:01,319
would follow up almost every te almost

332
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,120
every feeding with at least a light te

333
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,720
um because it it that's that's what's

334
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,480
going to speed up the breakdown of what

335
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,278
you just introduced that a lot of which

336
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,959
is not necessarily immediately available

337
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,838
for the plants and the biology is what

338
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,479
make what makes it available so it's

339
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,000
almost like introducing nutrients into a

340
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,800
healthy compost that's alive that soil

341
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,360
will Auto will will immediately start to

342
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,319
break that stuff down and it'll happen

343
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,680
relatively quickly um whereas a sterile

344
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,240
media you introduce the nutrients and

345
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,120
it's going to take them longer to break

346
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,480
down because the biological activity

347
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,919
going on in that soil is to is a much

348
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,920
lesser scale

349
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:48,819
