1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,809
I wish I had the original Durbin poison

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,278
I mean that went to Amsterdam became

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,140
something entirely different

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,089
not entirely different but quite

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,808
different but the first one that I had

6
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:14,309
had the one that I really liked

7
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:14,849
actually I just lost it it never went to

8
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:17,129
Amsterdam

9
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,350
well when today I had two different

10
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:22,169
lines of the Durban I hadn't in a and B

11
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,390
and the a happened to be the one that I

12
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,060
liked the most it had a a real licorice

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,240
flavor it had purple stigmas which you

14
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:35,189
just don't see you know purple was some

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:37,109
of them with lavender that I wish I had

16
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,170
you know what you have now is a much

17
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:43,738
more commercial kind of rendition of

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,469
what went to Amsterdam part of that

19
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,479
problem was that I made a mistake it's

20
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,359
really embarrassing but I gave skunk me

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,119
and Sam Afghani one I gave him the

22
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:57,420
Durban the beeline but the beeline had a

23
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:00,299
little bit of her Africa's aminute and I

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,600
I didn't realize it when I gave it to

25
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:05,969
him at the time and I didn't find this

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,469
out until many years later when he told

27
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:08,969
me you had to work with it work with it

28
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,719
work with it they get rid of their

29
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,579
magnetism right so that was part of what

30
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:17,759
changed that that lying a lot but it's a

31
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:20,188
heavier yielder now it's not as sativa

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,030
like as it was when I first got it but

33
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:27,929
it was the most unusual plant that I I

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,430
would say variety that I grow I've seen

35
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,890
individuals that were pretty spectacular

36
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,930
but as a variety it was just very

37
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,239
different from anything else the main

38
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,420
thing was this is what a short season it

39
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,949
was you know I agree that you are

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,868
harvesting it here in Oakland in

41
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,049
September and when I brought it to New

42
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:48,810
York this is about 60 miles from New

43
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:53,570
York City we were having some of that in

44
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:57,060
August it was that that early so in

45
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:59,039
being from the east originally my whole

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,879
thing with breeding when I came out here

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,310
was to develop cultivars that could

48
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,429
mature back east before the terrible

49
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,770
weather came in

50
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,090
because the people I knew who grew up

51
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,390
back there they were basically growing

52
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,979
leaf are really crappy Mexican that had

53
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:17,319
some flowers right

54
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:20,799
I saw a situation out there where I went

55
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,019
back I already had hybrids F ones of

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,060
things like Afghani and Congolese

57
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,100
Afghani in Nigeria and Afghani and

58
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,000
Durban and so forth but I went back and

59
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:33,340
I took those sativa crosses and I caused

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,080
him again to Afghani to try to make sure

61
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,080
that we go out the shortness of Afghani

62
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,280
in there and they did fantastic out

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,040
there I mean those people couldn't

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,479
believe how strong that pot was they had

65
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,719
never experienced anything like in their

66
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,719
lives
