00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:04,120
yes sir

18
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:07,390
resin hits resin heads resin hits we

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:16,320
make ice water hash and rosin this is

20
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:21,489
summing of rosin yes sir that one's GMO

21
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:26,319
garlic cookies it's not funky offensive

22
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:28,419
smell to it beautiful resin we heard you

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:32,199
recently took second place at the ego

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:35,469
clash for cold water extraction yes sir

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:40,570
what was the strings it was a mix of

26
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:43,209
papaya and banana OG 90 micron mix that

27
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:48,339
sounds very nice do you happen to have

28
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:51,339
any with you yes yes would you pop it

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,290
open whoo and take them that's not rosin

30
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,920
that is not roses bubble a creative

31
00:01:53,290 --> 00:02:02,799
bubble hash straight heads 90 micron

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:06,280
that is gorgeous and so you say this is

33
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,939
a full metal cold water extraction yes

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,550
just ice and water no solvents no

35
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:16,930
solvents and it will melt like an oil

36
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:21,580
yes it'll melt like water how would you

37
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:25,000
describe that flavor almost like a

38
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,310
fermenting bananas I don't really know

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,460
how else to describe it has almost got a

40
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,830
almost a rotting fruit smell to it and

41
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:37,480
then the banana just comes through with

42
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:39,790
like a creamy sweetness almost and what

43
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:43,379
got you into making bubble hash opposed

44
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:45,909
to solvent was how I solve them hash I

45
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:49,769
had a bunch of roommates that lived in a

46
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:54,310
min to see no County growing up and

47
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:56,320
their family grew weed and every harvest

48
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,479
time a little bit after four actually

49
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,489
around now Christmas time right this is

50
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,679
hash season they'd always come home and

51
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,840
bring some hat and it was my favorite

52
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,040
thing to throw on bowls and smoke I just

53
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,050
really enjoyed it and so did you watch a

54
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:15,429
lot of trim when you started there buds

55
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:19,410
yes started out with trim basically I'm

56
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:22,420
a grower get our stuff trimmed freeze it

57
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,310
we used to make BHO

58
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:27,339
didn't really like the way that was

59
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,590
going the taste or just the potential

60
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,310
hazards that involve are involved with

61
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:35,050
me canned vho so I personally just

62
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,849
really wanted to get into bubble hash

63
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:42,790
and to clean our product yeah clean

64
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:49,079
product just ice water agitation no

65
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:52,239
solvents no chemicals that tastes

66
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,910
exceptionally good you get that real

67
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,879
banana OG on the front end and a lot of

68
00:03:54,909 --> 00:04:01,689
the papaya coming on the back yeah

69
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:04,030
there's like a tropical smoothie got

70
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:06,550
lucky with that mix I will say that and

71
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,169
so that's a the second best hash in

72
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,180
California right now guys

73
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:13,729
and you got a trophy for that right yes

74
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:19,329
sir yes I did I'll show that to you in a

75
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:21,349
sec you can heat me up um that yeah and

76
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:24,620
who made the trophy

77
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:29,180
JD maple s'en I hope I'm saying that

78
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:31,069
correct he's been making trophy all he's

79
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,889
been doing glass for quite some time he

80
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:36,589
has made trophies for the Emerald cup I

81
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:40,789
believe he did the trophies last year

82
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:42,589
for the ego clash he's definitely a

83
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,689
pretty coveted artist when it comes to

84
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:47,419
the scene and it's got a three-hole Bowl

85
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:49,850
yeah the old style of threw bubble hash

86
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,470
you need a three whole bowl ball it up

87
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,600
stick it in there and you use a glass

88
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,820
rod with the rounded kind of marble end

89
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,720
you heat that up and you just kind of

90
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:02,029
like hold it over press it in and kind

91
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,650
of dab away if you guys with good bubble

92
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:05,299
hash it's essentially oil and we tried

93
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:06,169
to hit it with a pipe it'll just turn to

94
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,870
oil and yep

95
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:13,490
thin membrane and just kind of melts

96
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:16,699
away to almost nothing and ru hand

97
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:20,300
stirring or using machines or a paint

98
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:24,649
stirrer I use machines and bubble

99
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:28,370
machines I don't really have time to

100
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:30,169
hand stir it takes takes some time and

101
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,689
obviously you get a great product with

102
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:35,210
using machines yeah you know I mean I

103
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:38,060
think you get just as good as a product

104
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:40,279
as you do with the hand stirring it just

105
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,879
maybe takes a little bit more time to

106
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:46,819
clean up here and there but it allows

107
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:48,529
you time while the machines are spinning

108
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:51,430
to do the other things you need well

109
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:53,869
like cleaning sanitizing prep work for

110
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,720
pulling the bags and getting everything

111
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:00,680
ready so that's kind of my reasoning

112
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:04,790
behind it I can't just justify standing

113
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,959
there for hours using an oar and hand

114
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,080
stirring hand

115
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:10,758
can't time is money exactly especially

116
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:12,409
when you grow your own material

117
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,379
you really got all the time in the world

118
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,080
and you got to spend a lot of it

119
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:20,269
processing and cleaning I'm just gonna

120
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,668
the term glorified janitor has been

121
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:25,069
tossed around yes 100%

122
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:28,159
I have to try some of this GMO because

123
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:32,360
it smells I don't know how you describe

124
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:51,500
that smell but it's very unique it's

125
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:52,750
very offensive off-putting almost that's

126
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,819
funky

127
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,819
real interesting flavor on this one I

128
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,110
don't even know how to describe it it's

129
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:06,500
just like a garlic and burnt rubber

130
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,389
maybe it's kind of offensive but it

131
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,410
reminds me of like the old school cat

132
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,060
piss almost there

133
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,889
you know something where you smell you

134
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,319
like oh that smells disgusting but I

135
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:18,408
need to smoke it yeah that's that's the

136
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,360
weird thing about weed definitely some

137
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:22,879
offensive flavors that you smell and

138
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:27,069
you're something you I want to smoke

139
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:30,829
that interesting

140
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:31,848
this second place trophy is that's a

141
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:35,029
beautiful piece of work with the

142
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:37,639
trichomes all up at all yeah that's a

143
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:40,250
nice marble you've worked a few more

144
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:44,449
twig wags fumed marble right there on

145
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:48,220
the front a really great job like I did

146
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:51,949
a really great job on those trophies I

147
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:55,090
love it man I grew up in Sonoma County

148
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:58,680
we have a lot of glass artists here a

149
00:07:55,089 --> 00:08:00,479
lot of smoke shops growing up

150
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,389
I've always loved going in and just

151
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,400
looking at the glass even when I didn't

152
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,829
smoke even before when I was a kid and

153
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,839
younger you know before it was a lot

154
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:11,459
that you had to be 18 to go in you could

155
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,529
just kind of walk in and look at the

156
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,989
stuff and it's kind of hypnotizing all

157
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:19,139
the girls love them I'm always loved it

158
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:21,750
just the craftsmanship that is put into

159
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,459
it the pride they put it into it the

160
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,920
hours they put into hours they've

161
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:32,098
learned how exact mold their craft and

162
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:34,229
to make these beautiful pieces I mean it

163
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:40,349
takes definitely a lot of time and

164
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:43,050
dedication so it's cool to like smoke

165
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:45,660
your art out of someone else's art kinda

166
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,639
because it takes almost as much time to

167

really mess the glass community and the

168
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,509
hash community a very close-knit because

169

170
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:54,960
always pushing each other they push each

171
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,299
other and they work with each other yeah

172
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:02,430
because they rely on each other exactly

173
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:05,699
