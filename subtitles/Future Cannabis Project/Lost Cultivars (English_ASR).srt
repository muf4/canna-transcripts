1
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:09,559
Strawberry Cough yeah

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:19,500
that's a deep question for me it would

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,689
be something that no one in the cannabis

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,559
community knows it's just the rapture

5
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:28,259
it's an old NL g13 house playing across

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,848
from North Carolina the question was

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,359
what do you regret losing the most I

8
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:36,320
lost a plant that would have come out of

9
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:39,509
like the late 80s out of riceland and

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,929
when you lit it it looked like a burning

11
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:44,579
tire and I got so high when I smoked it

12
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:46,170
that I'd lay down on the couch and my

13
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,670
girl would come in and I'd wake up and

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,530
she'd be wiping my face with the rag

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,660
asking me if I was sick because I was

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,170
feverish and I would mumble and I'm

17
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:58,890
doing really high and it had the most

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,230
complete effect I've ever experienced

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,219
and it was stunning cannabis in every

20
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:08,640
aspect it had a visual quality it had a

21
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:13,079
growth quality it had a quality a high

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,618
that was unreal and it got killed by

23
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,569
mistake and I said I will go find more

24
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:21,989
like that but I realized quickly that

25
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:23,699
that was a memory and that was the one I

26
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:27,509
wish I had back more than anyone it was

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,740
so green it was almost like blue and icy

28
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,200
cold like that you know like a blue

29
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,390
varietal but it literally would make

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,509
regular people ill they would it would

31
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,040
it would fold you over and and kick you

32
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,790
in the ass and send you home and say

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,740
come back when you grown up the beauty

34
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,079
of cannabis is that all of us have that

35
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,399
special thing and that's why I've always

36
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,929
been trying to explain to people you

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,700
don't have to be a big banker but you

38
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,290
get a bank a little bit you got to make

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,810
sure you keep some stock you got to make

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,920
sure you're involved in some breeding

41
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,320
don't let anybody talk to you

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,359
because your pollen chucker you're

43
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,218
somebody who has historically done what

44
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,959
we've done since the dawn of time you've

45
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:06,899
chosen things to put together for your

46
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,878
desire and when people ask me you know

47
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,370
what should I smoke I'm like I'm not

48
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,239
qualified to tell you cuz I'm not you I

49
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,710
can put you into things

50
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,870
and I can help you understand why you

51
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,820
like it but fundamentally I'm not you

52
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm not qualified to tell you what you

53
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:21,729
should like it's like telling someone

54
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,930
who they should love you're not

55
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:27,609
qualified but you are you you what you I

56
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,290
know you lost something good man you've

57
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:35,980
had a lot of stuff in your hand boy oh

58
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:38,109
yeah and that's where you come into it

59
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:40,539
with the sharing and it's like I being a

60
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,950
being breeding seeds and taking these

61
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,989
times it's like they're they're your

62
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:46,030
children and it's like that's like the

63
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,250
one thing it's like spreading that right

64
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,150
now and it was like back in the you know

65
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,490
the early 90s and and running into walls

66
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,189
and and getting losing these certain

67
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,900
genetics and that's like what was drove

68
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:00,699
me back to go to like Southeast Asia

69
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,960
it's like finding this you know that was

70
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:03,549
happy pizzas I don't know if you've been

71
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,469
to Cambodia but you eat this

72
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,910
pizza and you're tripping you know

73
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:10,359
you're you're in Cambodia on that and

74
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:12,789
there's this different level to that and

75
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,770
this was something when you could grow

76
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:16,239
this and it was a nice producer it would

77
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,189
grow under the man's and eat as well

78
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,689
here and you could put it in a mixed bag

79
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:22,449
of tricks and get fifty six hundred a

80
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:24,579
pound for it it had different colors it

81
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:27,219
wasn't that name but that's like he's

82
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,910
some old Southeast Asian you know these

83
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:34,240
these long flowering times but just the

84
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:36,159
soaring psychedelic highs and that

85
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,390
different feeling and that's part of

86
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,669
that bap tracking and finding what

87
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:44,859
exactly like one of them with CBD it was

88
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:47,049
reaching out to you know with Ringo and

89
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,180
like Jaime when this was when people

90
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,490
were first introducing that you know the

91
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,069
wanita lugworm osa and that you know

92
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:56,500
that canna tonic those old genetics and

93
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,659
it's like okay well this was Oaxaca this

94
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,909
region Colombia you know where were

95
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:03,400
these things coming from and then trying

96
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:04,930
to search those out and that's like when

97
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,810
you mention that with Africa what's is

98
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,909
getting is we're losing this you know

99
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,099
these unique ones that are out there and

100
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:14,650
it's being able to find these special

101
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:16,000
ones but at what point we we you want to

102
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,370
share these but you don't want them to

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,048
go under the wrong hands

104
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,329
and that's something we're gonna be

105
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:25,079
facing right now being breeders I think

106
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:27,918
coming more and more as we've got bigger

107
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,180
players that are coming in and are just

108
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,680
they don't realize the time and the

109
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,900
energy that's put into these certain

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,959
cultivars and how rare and special they

111
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:44,009
are and that that's something that we

112
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:46,109
have to protect drew drew Strawberry

113
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:49,110
Cough I lost that I had right away and I

114
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,270
thought about it a lot like my pops and

115
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,180
beans that I haven't found anything it

116
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:55,740
was it was that I'm pretty sure it was

117
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,490
the Strawberry Cough because I've seen

118
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,079
the COFF

119
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,418
and it had that you know that's very

120
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,870
distinguished like real thick smoke you

121
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:05,579
know but it was the first plant that we

122
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,459
ever I'm ever going to did to plants

123
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:11,550
under two lights and we got six pounds

124
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,649
we were like it was like blown away the

125
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,449
first time that ever happened and it was

126
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:17,698
very easy to trim just these little golf

127
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,169
ball knows which most the cough is not

128
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,180
in the Strawberry Cough it's his bigger

129
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:23,370
you know denser fluffier but it was

130
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,668
really anyways and it was it was really

131
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,709
because I was medicine for me I came

132
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:31,529
into cannabis from a bicycle accident

133
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:33,269
and so I was up mega hit by a car

134
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:35,579
I was up really hard for a couple

135
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:37,560
years and just like learning to grow

136
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:38,939
weed walking around the house smoking as

137
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,788
much weed as I could and there was that

138
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:45,060
Strawberry Cough that like really was

139
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:47,129
able to help me manage so it was a damn

140
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,839
sharks breath that I lost it to I got

141
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:51,449
stuck with the shark wreck cutting that

142
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,739
I hated that thing and as I took a cut

143
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:54,240
and I thought it was a strawberry and I

144
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,500
messed it up and it was a shark's breath

145
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,129
and I could never get rid of that

146
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,129
plant
