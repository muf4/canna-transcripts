1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
so the county has had a ban on

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,209
commercial cannabis businesses for about

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,789
ten years that prohibition was recently

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,679
extended to give us time to develop

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:13,349
regulation so the board has directed us

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,900
to go out and develop regulations but

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,480
the board also wanted us to maintain a

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,859
status quo so that you know we don't

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,960
have any changes in what's going on

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,960
until they see the package and a prison

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,018
okay so there's a wrinkle in federal law

12
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:33,179
cannabis is an illegal controlled

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:37,259
substance under federal law so it's

14
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:39,659
still criminalized to sell to sell

15
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:42,479
cannabis even if you're in compliance

16
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:45,269
with your state and local regulatory

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,968
system so there are some things in place

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,280
at the federal level that have have the

19
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,808
DOJ hands-off at the moment we don't

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,000
know what the new administration will do

21
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,939
in terms of changing those those

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,799
guidance documents so this creates a lot

23
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:00,479
of uncertainty for the cannabis industry

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,399
and we may have cannabis industry

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,188
participants here tonight or aware of

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,960
this the primary one of the primary

27
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,419
issues besides being afraid to get

28
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,688
arrested is that they don't you know

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,340
businesses don't have access to standard

30
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:15,959
financial services that other businesses

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,240
could use like they can't take debit

32
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,099
cards they can't take credit cards

33
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,390
it's expensive to get a bank account a

34
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,089
lot of businesses can't afford a bank

35
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,349
account so there's a lot of cash in

36
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,240
these transactions that creates

37
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,158
opportunities for crime and from our

38
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,408
perspective as regulators they creates

39
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,310
opportunities for people to not report

40
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,439
how much money they're earning more

41
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,210
background so I mentioned this the board

42
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,919
of supervisors did direct the

43
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:43,349
preparation of cannabis regulations for

44
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,939
unincorporated County lats and uary

45
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:46,649
they gave us some of they gave us some

46
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,078
objectives to reach

47
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,299
so that's maximizing the transition from

48
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,969
unlicensed business activity to a

49
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,579
regulated marketplace essentially to you

50
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,500
know go from a largely unregulated space

51
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:59,209
to a regulated space it sounds easier

52
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,109
than it is

53
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:04,618
avoid blight and prevent over

54
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:06,478
concentration there is a worry that with

55
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:08,128
the location of businesses you could

56
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,270
actually end up with too many in one

57
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,489
place that could cause

58
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,980
either blight or overexposure or some

59
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,480
unintended consequences the board wants

60
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,549
us to address principles of equitable

61
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,129
development that includes equity and

62
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,689
licensing and also includes other

63
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:23,310
equitable development principles like

64
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:25,500
making sure certain communities don't

65
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,819
quote bear the burden of legalization

66
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,500
which could happen they are focused on

67
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,519
environmental sustainability measures so

68
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,449
we're taking a look at for example

69
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,580
cultivators who use a lot of electricity

70
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:41,339
we're taking a look at those rules to

71
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,010
see where can we conserve on electricity

72
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,170
and make sure we're conscientious and

73
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:47,759
how we're using resources and address

74
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:50,699
the issue of youth access and exposure

75
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,889
to Canada so it's one of the board's

76
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:56,339
goals to ensure that youth usage does

77
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:57,989
not increase that is a primary goal of

78
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,870
almost every regulatory system for

79
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,159
cannabis in the country and we are going

80
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,009
to talk about that today at one of the

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,139
tables

82
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:08,449
okay so community voices matters now let

83
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,379
me just explain what we're doing

84
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:13,229
usually the county will draft

85
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:15,389
regulations and then publish them for 60

86
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:17,579
days and people will come down to the

87
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:19,589
Board of Supervisors and they'll yell

88
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,450
they'll scream they will not have been

89
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,170
notified and the county gets defensive

90
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:26,819
we react we make some changes we're

91
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:28,349
trying to avoid that process for this

92
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,659
because this is so new and so different

93
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,909
and so dynamic and changing all the time

94
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,669
the board has asked us to go to the

95
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,469
public first get the feedback and then

96
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:40,049
develop regulations that are responsive

97
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:41,609
to the feedback so that's why this isn't

98
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,920
your traditional Town Hall because we

99
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,540
don't have answers for you yet we want

100
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,639
to hear what you say before we put pen

101
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,829
to paper on any of the regulation so

102
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,319
what you say tonight will be documented

103
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,730
will become part of a report we have 18

104
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,109
of these listening sessions everything

105
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:57,030
will become part of a report that will

106
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,070
be public that the board can consider

107
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:04,189
when looking at what to adopt or

108
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:06,419
unincorporated area so as Joe mentioned

109
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:08,310
18 different sessions you all are

110
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,859
kicking off the very first one and we're

111
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,840
going to be having these through August

112
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,760
12th so they'll be taking place in

113
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,009
evenings and also on Saturday mornings

114
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,668
all around all of the five supervisorial

115
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:23,009
districts and there are six particular

116
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,168
traffic areas around which we're going

117
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:28,019
to have the same kinds of facilitated

118
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:30,539
small group discussions and recorded

119
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:33,478
answers so that we can feed all of this

120
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,160
back into a report that's going to be

121
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,379
used to help to make recommendations

122
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,860
that will ultimately lead to regulation

123
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:45,418
so these are the six topic areas and our

124
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,330
six table are broken out along these

125
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,879
deep topic areas so who have you access

126
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:54,269
to exposure to cannabis that's one table

127
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:57,779
and the discussion for that table is

128
00:04:54,269 --> 00:05:00,990
going to be guided by everybody have a

129
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:03,929
copy of your information packet you all

130
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,720
got the same information so everybody

131
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,970
here should have a packet that has six

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,820
different cheeps in it the quadfather

133
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,520
the six different areas except you we

134
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:17,040
give you something else we'll get you

135
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,529
others whether there's more fudge there

136
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,930
are a couple of discussion topics for

137
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:25,139
each of the different areas as well as

138
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,939
some background information and you'll

139
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,379
get a little bit of time when we move to

140
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,329
your tables that you want to start with

141
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:33,569
to sort of go over what the background

142
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:35,430
information is and then on the back you

143
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:39,180
will see that there are questions that

144
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,668
your facilitator will ask you to give

145
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,490
answers to those are what I'm going to

146
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:48,418
know part of the recommendations that go

147
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:51,120
forward to the supervisors there's one

148
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:52,799
of these for each of the areas so we're

149
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,660
shift Annabeth's business was located

150
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,569
with the location tables great that's

151
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,520
yellow cultivation who's our cultivation

152
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:01,439
tables green excellent right up here

153
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,599
taxation and revenue the money people

154
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,600
money and spending all right pink and

155
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,939
then equity and economic development is

156
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,830
in the back the blue table and finally

157
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:14,290
other concerns we recognized

158
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:17,050
that there may be some topics that you

159
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,600
want to express questions comments

160
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,540
concerns about that don't follow easily

161
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,730
increase other five areas there is going

162
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,890
to be a facilitated discussion and also

163
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,629
reported answers at that table so do

164
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,490
know that there is a place to go if

165
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:33,219
these are not the topics you want to

166
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,370
talk about so how this is going to work

167
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,710
we are going to in just a moment have

168
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,680
you break and first so through whatever

169
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:43,829
table you feel like you want to talk at

170
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,949
first there's going to be four different

171
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:50,229
periods of time 25 minute allocation for

172
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,289
used to talk so that means you won't be

173
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:56,080
able to necessarily go to all of those

174
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,900
discussion topics for 25 minutes you'll

175
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,550
have to sort of govern your own time and

176
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,679
maybe leave one conversation and go to

177
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,879
another but we have designed that so

178
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,400
that you will be able to have

179
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,069
facilitated discussions for four of

180
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,469
these topic areas at 25 minutes each

181
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:14,620
we're going to let you know when it's

182
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:17,650
time to move to the next topic area

183
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,850
first we're going to have a big song and

184
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:20,829
then we thought that might be able to

185
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,660
disrupt itself there'll be something a

186
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:24,609
little less intrusive like from somebody

187
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,990
going through to the table letting your

188
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:32,410
facilitators know that it's time to I do

189
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:36,100
want to ask everyone to honor the ground

190
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:38,620
rules for participating in table tops

191
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:42,270
there on the back of your agenda which

192
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:46,509
is the very first page of your packet

193
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:48,609
with a nice icon here basically we're

194
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:51,969
just asking people to keep your comments

195
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,150
brief respect one another not everybody

196
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,100
here will agree but respects one another

197
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:59,079
screen silence your cellphone's stay

198
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,640
focused and try not to talk over one

199
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,250
another because we definitely want to

200
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,620
capture what it is that you're saying so

201
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,350
we need to have talking one at a time

202
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,300
we're asking you to follow these and

203
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,250
when it's time to move to a new

204
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,860
discussion we don't need to go over

205
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,300
deeper games but just bear in mind these

206
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,819
are the rules that we're asking people

207
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,550
to abide by so the whole

208
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:23,610
I recognize that your facilitator is

209
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,960
there to help encourage conversation to

210
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:30,060
get your feedback into an improv new

211
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:33,210
regulations and they're not subject

212
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,940
matter experts if you have a question

213
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,650
about something that is technical along

214
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,140
the lines with what Joe raised earlier

215
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,759
there are question cogs here in the

216
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:43,799
middle of every table you can write it

217
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,629
down and raise it up there will be

218
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,459
people from the office of cannabis

219
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:49,409
management and perhaps others county

220
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,540
staff too who will be wandering through

221
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:53,719
and can answer those questions along the

222
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:53,719
way

223
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:59,009
yes comments will be reported for public

224
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,509
reports but no comments will be

225
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:03,689
attributed which is what we said before

226
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:06,509
so in general do you all feel like you

227
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,820
understand how this is going to flow yes

228
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:10,649
okay this is an experiment

229
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,800
y'all have a very close group we're

230
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,809
trying and risk so we'll see how well it

231
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,049
works and then we'll adapt it for future

232
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:22,349
sessions believe me so what I'm going to

233
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:23,759
ask you to do right now is to if you

234
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,860
don't want to stay at the table where

235
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,419
you are understanding that in 25 minutes

236
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:33,470
you'll be able to rotate to another one

237
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:33,469
now the time in a minute
