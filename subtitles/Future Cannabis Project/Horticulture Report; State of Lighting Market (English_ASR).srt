00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,969
hello everyone my name is John Wilson

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,509
I am Tribune of the stakeholders for

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:17,608
Seattle City Lights lighting design lab

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,289
I'm gonna set the table very quickly and

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,760
make up some time by talking about you

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,900
know what why do you Tillett ease care

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,368
about this conversation why are they

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,989
actually in it beyond the sort of

10
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:25,679
platitudes that we often hear like I'm

11
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:27,538
just trying to get some energy

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,219
efficiency and hit these targets right

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,420
there's really three reasons that

14
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:35,009
utilities are making this investment and

15
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,270
their their business models are evolving

16
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,219
and I'm just gonna touch on that quickly

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,260
and the rest of my colleagues are really

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,939
gonna take it home the three topics

19
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,439
really are yes there's reliable energy

20
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:45,539
savings that's kind of like the first

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,399
generation like we all understand

22
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,109
utilities want to get cost-effective

23
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,480
savings especially where there's targets

24
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,670
or regulations in place

25
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,319
you know requiring them to do so the

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,030
next really big topic is what a lot of

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,488
utilities are describing generically as

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,198
like customer service plus utilities are

29
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:02,968
rapidly waking up to the fact that they

30
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,280
need to be part of the solution for

31
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,829
technology transfer and not a hindrance

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,780
or you know somebody who is slow in that

33
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:14,099
process down and to deliver you know to

34
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,719
technical professional services to

35
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,938
utilities is something that's going to

36
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,349
reinforce the utility business model and

37
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:21,629
allow them to sustain what they're doing

38
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,179
and then the last one is just kind of

39
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:25,890
funny because it's it's back in vogue

40
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,720
after like since like the 1940s but it's

41
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,609
next generation electrification and this

42
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,769
really has to do with our current

43
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:35,328
climate around carbon reduction in the

44
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:39,298
fact that electrification now leads to

45
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:42,688
hopefully a reduction in um you know

46
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,149
harmful greenhouse gases and all that so

47
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:46,618
if you are a utility it's not any one of

48
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,180
these things it's all three of these

49
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:49,859
things and for the utility community

50
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,960
members in the room I encourage you to

51
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,459
think about putting your business plan

52
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,019
together and addressing all three of

53
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,728
these things to make a comprehensive

54
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:59,718
plan for why your utility should make a

55
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:04,950
sustained investment in the CEA market

56
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:06,750
so what is different now then like I

57
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,118
don't know the last five or ten years

58
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,469
and you know what why are we at you know

59
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,419
what many people are kind of describing

60
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,800
as an inflection point or a real growth

61
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,719
opportunity well I

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,700
described for you what has changed on

63
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,199
the utility landscape it's no longer

64
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,060
just about energy savings

65
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,099
it's about load growth it's about

66
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,870
delivering a level of customer service

67
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,069
that makes you know that gives the

68
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,909
utility a chance to have a positive

69
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:32,400
interaction with customers beyond just

70
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:35,189
billing you once a month right but what

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,689
is happening is it's really how those

72
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,609
things are starting to align with the

73
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:40,109
Horticultural lighting market and where

74
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,260
things you know where the alignment is

75
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,600
starting to come together so 5-10 years

76
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:48,030
ago we didn't have great reliable

77
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,310
product that was trusted by consumers

78
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,840
the time wasn't right for utilities to

79
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,069
push that as a kWh saving mechanism

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,770
similarly utilities were less interested

81
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,780
in load growth than electrification ten

82
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,780
years ago than they are now and that's

83
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,000
reflected in any utility conference that

84
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,250
you go to that's the big buzzword and

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,069
then last but not least cultivators are

86
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,900
hungry for information and although

87
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,609
utilities might be strange bedfellows as

88
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,140
far as a resource where you would go to

89
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,900
get that people are hungry for

90
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:21,029
information and utilities in just about

91
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,069
every other CNI market and with

92
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,860
residential consumers have played a

93
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,530
helpful role in the past delivering that

94
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,910
service and good information and so you

95
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,319
can see these things are aligning in

96
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,359
such a way that give me a lot of

97
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,530
optimism that we're going to be able to

98
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,520
team up and really make a positive

99
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,129
impact everybody is familiar with this

100
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,250
basic technology diffusion curve invest

101
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:46,199
on the Left cash out on the right when

102
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,759
Matt was talking about making LED lights

103
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,289
in his basement that's so far off the

104
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,269
left that like it's not even on this

105
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:52,829
chart but it takes people like that to

106
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,739
get this whole thing going right so

107
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,330
we're familiar with this what is so cool

108
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,489
again it's reinforced in because I'm a

109
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,830
visual learner

110
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,900
we now have organizations like the DLC

111
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,370
Leora's gonna be up here taking this

112
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,370
that'll help propping this up we have

113
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,219
our III what a phenomenal resource and

114
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,259
then it's really like in my mind those

115
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,539
two organizations are like two of the

116
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:18,089
most critical pillars that needed to be

117
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:20,668
in place in order for utilities to come

118
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,409
behind and like do the stuff that is our

119
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,990
bread and butter work in the traditional

120
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,910
CNI markets before we could be effective

121
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,400
in this market we needed to

122
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,750
we know we needed the resources and the

123
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,539
tools that are brought by those other

124
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,009
you know DLC and ri-ight so it's just

125
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,689
terrific that these are in place because

126
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:41,529
it gives us something as a utility

127
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:43,329
personnel to work from you know

128
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:45,399
information a balance people are so

129
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:46,959
hungry for information out there and

130
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,120
where do you go when you're hungry for

131
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:53,620
information you go to the YouTube right

132
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,980
and a quick search about grow lights or

133
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,230
growing cannabis you know you could

134
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,420
spend all day looking at the science

135
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,400
stuff you can spend all day looking at

136
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,560
this stuff online and while you might

137
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,359
get some good nuggets of information

138
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,560
it's nothing is as good it's coming here

139
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,730
to this conference and the information

140
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,100
that you're getting listening to these

141
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,509
bonafide speakers get up and really open

142
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,980
up and share in the cross-pollination

143
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,310
we're getting with utilities and the

144
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,720
cultivation community coming together

145
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,310
outside this cultivation space we have a

146
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,530
really positive track record working

147
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,030
with industry and my favorite thing the

148
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:27,189
first efficient yields workshop I went

149
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:29,500
to I did not know it was a utility

150
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:30,850
function and tell somebody like pointed

151
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,199
that out to me they did the utility

152
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,390
energy trust I got to give him props

153
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,949
they did so good getting out of the way

154
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,259
and letting there be a really healthy

155
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:40,120
peer-to-peer information exchange that

156
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,819
it was unlike any other utility

157
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,009
experience I'd ever gone to and I really

158
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,329
believe as we think about utilities how

159
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:48,180
can we work better with the cultivation

160
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:52,149
community that's going to be a big key

161
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,930
you know support good information who to

162
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:58,629
do to do if you are a utility continue

163
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,400
to support the good information that's

164
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:02,019
about that that is out there consider

165
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,199
becoming a member of organizations like

166
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:07,060
RI I support or at least engage with the

167
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,219
work DL C is doing in this horticultural

168
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,259
space because it's gonna be a way to

169
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,030
right-size your utility investment so

170
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:14,649
you can be effective and participate in

171
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:17,049
this market even if you don't have a

172
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:18,579
huge customer base underneath you that

173
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,030
you know allows you to have a dedicated

174
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:24,639
person amplify trusted information and

175
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:27,399
my last one to sign out on my little

176
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,870
daughter think about the children water

177
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:30,609
in the crops the next generation coming

178
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,220
up so that's it for me thanks y'all and

179
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,160
my next speaker what I'm going to be

180
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,770
talking about is some industry trends

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,030
that we've seen as far as what's going

182
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:41,620
on in the global market for

183
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:43,599
horticultural lighting

184
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,959
but then also some terminology and

185
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,270
baselines so first again I'm creme

186
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,180
Wilder with fluence bioengineering we've

187
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:54,609
been we were a startup back in 2015 and

188
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,829
now we're owned by osram which is a 4.5

189
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,800
billion dollar lighting company globally

190
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:01,659
so we've got over 350 commercial

191
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,340
cannabis installations and over 80

192
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,949
commercial AG installations right now

193
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,198
and we've learned a ton over that whole

194
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,478
time period so it's one of those things

195
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,370
that as we get into looking at what is

196
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,189
going on globally we really have to pay

197
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,860
attention to what's coming the next 7 10

198
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:19,870
15 years and beyond so when we really

199
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,210
look at we were kind of in as far as the

200
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,689
whole global lighting market sorry

201
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,269
excuse me

202
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:28,990
is the greenhouse era and then going

203
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:30,819
into vertical and city farming era so

204
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,150
that's more indoor cultivation that's

205
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:36,129
more looking at rnd vertical farming and

206
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:38,168
such and the industry is just going to

207
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:39,879
continue to grow as we find more and

208
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:43,060
more pressures environmentally and

209
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,370
population wise so hopefully everyone in

210
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,009
this room has read the 2018 cannabis

211
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:51,069
energy report that REI and new frontier

212
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:53,139
data published two years ago which

213
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:55,478
really took a very very hard look I

214
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,639
think it was 25 plus pages of

215
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:01,029
information about just the cannabis

216
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,009
energy sector really the key highlight

217
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:06,279
there is that 70 times more energy

218
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:08,319
offense intensive than other commercial

219
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,029
lighting applications right now because

220
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,098
of the amount of light that's required

221
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:14,918
I'm going to step into that a little bit

222
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:17,439
more but also looking at the u.s. just

223
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:19,779
u.s. cannabis market trajectory here

224
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,689
we've got medical and adult use that's

225
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:24,969
projected here through the year 2025 but

226
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:26,918
also you can see the huge amount of the

227
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,590
illicit market which is predominantly

228
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:32,559
using HPS technology right now the

229
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:34,809
impacts on the energy sector because of

230
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,809
that are just going to continue to scale

231
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:39,338
up as we go so I wanted to touch quickly

232
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,929
about segments because there's a lot of

233
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,909
people in this room that absolutely know

234
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,409
this information hands down back and

235
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:46,778
forward but there's some people in this

236
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:48,639
room we've got a very diverse crowd that

237
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:50,470
is just brand new to the industry so we

238
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,360
really want to look at what does green

239
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,480
house means sometimes these are multi

240
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,840
acre multi hectare sites that require in

241
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,820
through lighting and in HVAC and reheat

242
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,500
etc to make sure that their crop

243
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,780
production is going to continue

244
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,289
there's also indoor cultivation it can

245
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:10,899
be very small multi level two tiers

246
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:14,110
lighting racks whatever but it's also a

247
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:16,209
very energy intensive environment when

248
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,159
you look at it and our current legacy

249
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,200
install base as far as indoor versus

250
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,789
greenhouse a very important factor that

251
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,550
you have to understand when you're

252
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:26,740
looking at energy modeling or producing

253
00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:28,599
rebates for these potentially is that

254
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,899
when you're talking indoor cultivation

255
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,040
you're talking sole source lighting so

256
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,379
unless you're using something like sola

257
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,659
tube the only lighting that you're going

258
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:39,580
to get is from the fixtures that you're

259
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:41,469
using in your environment however when

260
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,540
you go to greenhouse and you're looking

261
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,279
at the supplemental lighting is what you

262
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:49,029
have to look at this is where you're

263
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,829
using the existing DLI from the Sun plus

264
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:53,529
whatever supplemental lighting years

265
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:56,560
you're using so for a cannabis operation

266
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:59,889
if you're installing 900 ppfd in this

267
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:02,799
indoor environment here on the what is

268
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:05,759
that right on the left you may only be

269
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:08,709
installing somewhere between 3 4 500

270
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:12,279
ppfd depending on where you are if your

271
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:14,110
DL is low or high there's vertical

272
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,329
farming as well that we have to pay

273
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,279
attention to Sam was talking about his

274
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,110
farm earlier and then there's also

275
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,939
research environment which are usually

276
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,690
very tightly honed environments and

277
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,820
require a lot of controls so terms and

278
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,680
baselines and ecosystem let's talk a bit

279
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,330
about this so Nadia was talking about

280
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,979
yesterday how we haven't really touched

281
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,720
on D Li we haven't really touched on

282
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,269
some of these terms let's just go

283
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,590
through some of them really quickly

284
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:41,289
there's par which is photosynthetic

285
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,480
active radiation this is really just the

286
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:46,149
light the visible wavelength between 4

287
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,450
and 700 nanometers that is part that is

288
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:51,309
the light photosynthetic photon flux PPF

289
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,960
is the amount of light that's coming out

290
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:54,879
of the fixtures so amount of photons

291
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,920
actually that are coming out of the

292
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,600
fixture so this is kind of like the

293
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,919
total number of lumens that are coming

294
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,590
out of the fixtures for the commercial

295
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,990
lighting people ppfd photosynthetic

296
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:07,090
photon flux density that is how many

297
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:09,180
photons are actually hitting that plant

298
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:12,430
canopy or whatever canopy or

299
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,889
so that's what we call ppfd it's kind of

300
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:17,739
like foot tank put candles think about

301
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:20,019
that and then there's DLI which is daily

302
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,990
light integral again this is the amount

303
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:25,090
of light that is hitting over a course

304
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,700
of time so it's a measurement of how

305
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:31,060
much you're gonna get over 6 hours 8

306
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:34,000
hours 10 12 18 whatever the time period

307
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:37,059
is that you need to measure so a quick

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,350
little segue for lighting to commercial

309
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:41,319
or commercial lighting to horticulture

310
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,629
if you've got an office space I want to

311
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,930
really look at the first category which

312
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:49,629
is ppfd on this chart in a typical

313
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:52,209
office space you'll have about 37 to 65

314
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:54,970
foot candles which is equivalent to 6 to

315
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:57,280
10 ppfd that you will see in an office

316
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,110
space if anybody's got a apogee or a

317
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,250
like or light meter take it into your

318
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:05,769
office and you'll see 10 or 11 ppfd

319
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:09,460
for cannabis I mean you can go 7 900

320
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:11,949
1,500 2,000 and you can see how much

321
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,129
more energy and since of that is I used

322
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,720
to I like to use the little analogy that

323
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:18,879
you think about all of the lights that

324
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,350
are used in the Yankee Stadium and then

325
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,529
you take those and you condense them

326
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,810
into a large CVS and that's about the

327
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:29,620
equivalent to what a cannabis grow

328
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:31,179
operation is and we have to remember

329
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,220
always that our true customer is

330
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:36,759
actually the plant so we go back to

331
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:39,370
maybe third maybe fifth grade science

332
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:41,679
class and just remembering that chemical

333
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,340
reaction behind photosynthesis and what

334
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,169
that means

335
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,910
so our true customer is actually the

336
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:48,129
plant so we have to pay attention to the

337
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:50,199
whole environment it's not just lighting

338
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:52,419
and with that there's different growth

339
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,580
stages so in each of these growth stages

340
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:57,399
you're going to require a different ppfd

341
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,560
as well so from germination propagation

342
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,750
through veg and bulking going into

343
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:05,049
flowering and fruiting and finishing you

344
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,490
can have a range of anywhere from 6 10

345
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:10,599
50 ppfd

346
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,159
up to 900 and beyond environmental

347
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,860
conditions these are really important to

348
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,240
call out as well because again when you

349
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,370
change one thing you're going to

350
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,200
influence another and that's something

351
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,960
about the ecosystem that we really

352
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,700
always have to pay attention

353
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,250
we actually did a study with smut a

354
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,950
couple years ago where we looked at all

355
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:33,240
of the different systems together and a

356
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:36,330
straight HP s2 LED conversion for over

357
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,159
to led the first round reduced eighteen

358
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,900
percent overall and the second round

359
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,539
they were able to capture twenty five

360
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,639
percent savings so kc actually touched

361
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:46,079
on this and the lighting breakout

362
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,379
section the other day but it's always

363
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,050
important to test measure verify and

364
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:53,490
repeat and then continue to do this over

365
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:55,500
and over again so you can make

366
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,720
incremental improvements as you go

367
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,879
there's baseline fixture crosses so this

368
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,950
is very important again to the utilities

369
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,750
in the room to understand when you're

370
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,640
going from propagation to vegetative

371
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,649
flower there are definitely certain

372
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,049
technologies that are used a lot in

373
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:11,730
these different areas and so when you've

374
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:14,339
got propagation and this isn't like a

375
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:17,430
complete full list the cannabis cannabis

376
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,620
Energy Report has some and then also the

377
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:22,139
best practices guide call some of these

378
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,389
out too but you can have some fixture

379
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,429
classes that are quite reasonable now

380
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:31,139
going from t58 show all the way to

381
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:32,549
thousand watt high pressure sodium some

382
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,769
more trends are just really quickly

383
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:37,169
we've got more and more best practices

384
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:39,629
guides and publications coming out every

385
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:42,509
day so whether this is something that's

386
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:45,720
to do with getting grow rooms right led

387
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:47,250
HVAC something about energy it's a it's

388
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,050
really aggravating sometimes to hear

389
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,419
that oh there's just not enough data out

390
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:54,149
there it's it's it's coming there's

391
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:56,459
definitely some data and so just to say

392
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:57,199
and turn a blind eye that we don't have

393
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,120
the data

394
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,980
Colorado's got some really fantastic

395
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,879
publications and so does California so I

396
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,289
would say please go verify before

397
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,870
there's the idea that there's not data

398
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:11,309
out there again program trends we've got

399
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,049
state-level programs that we've talked

400
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:15,750
about already California has this

401
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:18,359
awesome mix tier lighting for

402
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,519
greenhouses which is six watts and below

403
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,320
or six to twenty five Watts depending on

404
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,419
what kind of tier you have for your

405
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,040
greenhouse and then as far as program

406
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:28,679
levels efficiency Vermont which is

407
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:31,110
Lauren it's going to have a nice rebate

408
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:34,019
program hydro-quebec also has a

409
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,340
prescriptive rebate program right now in

410
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,870
energy trust of Oregon

411
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:41,370
Doug is in the room they've rolled out a

412
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,070
program through their retail locations

413
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,350
as well and then finally what do

414
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:49,940
customers want I mean really we have

415
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:52,680
seen a very very dedicated trend between

416
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,720
lighting sales and where rebates are the

417
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,849
better the rebates the bigger the market

418
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,740
conversion I mean it's just it's been

419
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,870
shown year after year after year and

420
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,659
it's absolutely true the better

421
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,029
incentives that we can get the more

422
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:07,799
market adoption we absolutely get for

423
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:19,769
customers and they really appreciate

424
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:22,229
that that is it for me hi everyone I am

425
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:24,360
from the design lights consortium and if

426
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,100
you are a utility or have worked with

427
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,800
commercial lighting you're familiar with

428
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,240
who we are we are interested in market

429
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,339
transformation and we promote

430
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,649
high-quality energy-efficient lighting

431
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,350
and we work with utilities manufacturers

432
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:39,990
energy efficiency programs in order to

433
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,779
transform the market our guideposts are

434
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,950
energy quality and controllability and

435
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,419
that's whether we're talking about

436
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,900
horticultural lighting or network

437
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:50,429
lighting controls or our major qpl our

438
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,870
big list about solid-state lighting

439
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:55,519
controls which has half a million

440
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:58,440
products these are always our guideposts

441
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,870
we are a nonprofit organization we're

442
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,420
located in Boston Massachusetts we have

443
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,990
about 20 full-time staff located across

444
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,990
the United States

445
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:12,599
our main mode of operation is that we

446
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,399
create performance standards and

447
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,409
standards for utilities in order to use

448
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,720
for incentives we work with federal

449
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,910
local and state organizations in order

450
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,190
to have test methods that can then

451
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:27,480
inform qualified product lists that help

452
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:30,120
utilities provide incentives one of our

453
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,130
big outcomes is our qualified products

454
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,359
list we have an emerging one for

455
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,610
horticulture lighting I'm going to talk

456
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,549
about today but we also have many tools

457
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:40,019
and fact sheets and information that we

458
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:41,220
provide to utilities so that they

459
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,889
understand what's happening in the

460
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,170
market and of course our goal is to

461
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,910
accelerate energy efficient adoption and

462
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,590
right now that's mostly a

463
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,660
led because it is the most efficacious

464
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:53,789
light source that we have it's the one

465
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,820
that promises the longest life and the

466
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:59,279
largest maintenance savings one of the

467
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:02,099
things I want to tell you about is that

468
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,440
we very much are part of a rulemaking

469
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:06,449
type of process we're not legislated or

470
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,220
required to have rulemaking but every

471
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,620
single time that we have a draft of our

472
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,539
technical specifications we have a four

473
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:14,939
to six week comment period we encourage

474
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:17,639
you to provide your comments to us in

475
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,110
writing or by contacting us and then we

476
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,090
go through those comments we work with

477
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:23,189
our utility members to revise a

478
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:25,559
specification then we put it out to a

479
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,019
final draft so please be involved in our

480
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,819
rulemaking process um there will be a

481
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:34,889
new draft for a horticultural lighting

482
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:36,750
specification in April so the dlc is a

483
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,330
member organization we're supported by

484
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:42,119
74 member utilities across the United

485
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:43,559
States and Canada this is a list of our

486
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,049
utilities there are many of them in the

487
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,859
room so thank you Lauren thank you

488
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:51,089
seattle City Light very appreciative

489
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:53,099
this is some new data I wanted to share

490
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:54,720
with you so one of the things that we

491
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,369
hope to do with our horticultural

492
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,410
lighting specification and our qualified

493
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,909
products list is show the relationship

494
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,850
between the spec and the list and

495
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,190
incentives so this is data from Bob gun

496
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:06,929
from synergy and basically it shows that

497
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,240
out of the hundred and twenty-two top

498
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:11,970
utilities United States including DLC

499
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,890
members that about 40% of them are

500
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:17,539
either referencing the specification or

501
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:19,740
are requiring the list about another 50%

502
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:22,349
don't use our list at all but we are

503
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,940
seeing that change quickly and about 10%

504
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:26,009
of them don't have horticultural

505
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,180
lighting rebates at all so this is

506
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:29,549
something that we are keeping track of

507
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:33,269
and are hoping to see change in the next

508
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:34,619
year so why are you Atilla t's concerned

509
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:36,720
about rebates why are they concerned

510
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,609
about controlling lighting that's

511
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,440
because when you look at the power

512
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:42,359
demand the electrical power demand that

513
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,430
occurs in CEA whether it's in

514
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,500
greenhouses for flower or veg or

515
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,539
cannabis or indoor facilities lighting

516
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,670
is the dominant use of electricity in

517
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:52,440
these facilities and if we can use more

518
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,700
efficient lighting more efficacious

519
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,830
lighting and he'll still have the same

520
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,130
light levels the same DLI that we can

521
00:19:55,829 --> 00:20:01,009
really reduce our power demand so

522
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,410
regulators are of course are concerned

523
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:05,000
you look at the do a report from 2017 it

524
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,269
predicts that horticultural lighting and

525
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,250
CEA will grow by 15 to 25 percent year

526
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:13,819
over year and this is concerning the

527
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:16,220
states that have requirements for energy

528
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,269
efficiency or carbon mitigation and so

529
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,480
they want to keep track of what's going

530
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:22,309
on so we're seeing some variation in the

531
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,960
rollout of regulations across the u.s.

532
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:27,109
across the u.s. I know Kate Oil spoke

533
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,940
about this yesterday so what we're

534
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:30,859
seeing in the market is either lighting

535
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,779
power density limits so basically this

536
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:35,659
sets the top light level for your light

537
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:38,149
levels in your facility or a minimum

538
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,519
requirement for efficacy so this is PPF

539
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:43,340
per watt right light for what in

540
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,139
Illinois we see that Illinois allows you

541
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:49,329
to use the dlc qpl and you're

542
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:52,250
automatically able to comply or you can

543
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:53,869
use an LPD requirement Massachusetts is

544
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,819
similar they also have the ability for

545
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:57,889
you to give them data about products

546
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:59,769
that aren't on the DL C qpl and they'll

547
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:02,000
evaluate them for quality control

548
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:03,529
California we had a wonderful code

549
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,750
session yesterday is going through its

550
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:07,970
rulemaking for CEA they're trending

551
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:10,400
towards using efficacy instead of

552
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,019
lighting power density we're seeing it

553
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,370
in building codes city of Denver is an

554
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:15,289
example that has a brand new building

555
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:18,139
code that's gonna go into effect in

556
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:21,019
April 1st that basically says you have a

557
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:22,759
PPE threshold or you can use the DLC ppl

558
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:25,819
that's different for lamps versus

559
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:28,009
fixtures and IECC the International

560
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,629
Energy Conservation code just passed

561
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:32,420
through voting a new mandatory

562
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,310
requirement for CEA that will have a

563
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,560
minimum efficacy for these types of

564
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:42,679
facilities along with a coverage area

565
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:44,899
for that cultivation space so it's the

566
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,460
Wild West right this is early days in

567
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,040
CEA and horticultural lighting

568
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,559
especially we're trying to bring some

569
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,420
trusted information to growers and

570
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:56,419
utilities and code bodies and regulators

571
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,160
with a qpl so again we go through a

572
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,600
rulemaking type of process public

573
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,040
comment process where we're asking for

574
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,949
information from lots of stakeholders

575
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,019
but really not only is the qpl about

576
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,120
efficacy but it's about high quality and

577
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:12,559
what we mean by high quality is a life

578
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:15,529
in terms of par flux of 36,000 hours or

579
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:18,109
longer a life for drivers or fans of

580
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:20,299
50,000 hours or longer and a five-year

581
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:22,699
warranty and a horticultural safety

582
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:25,099
certification and if you don't have all

583
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,769
of that stuff you can't be on the qpl so

584
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:29,990
we worked with DNR Rose is one of the

585
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:31,700
amazing reviewers for our applications

586
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,319
that looks at the horticultural lighting

587
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,330
products we are very appreciative of

588
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,069
them so we work together to make sure

589
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:40,129
that only high quality products are on

590
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:41,839
the list again there's a value

591
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,950
proposition for the qpl for everyone

592
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,179
whether you're a grower and you're

593
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,670
looking for trusted third-party

594
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,980
information objective information you

595
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:52,039
can look at the qpl to sort by efficacy

596
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:55,039
or power demand or light or flux if you

597
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:57,109
are a manufacturer you can differentiate

598
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,670
yourself from other manufacturers by

599
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:01,969
having this trusted verified data

600
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:04,490
there's bad actors in every organization

601
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,870
in every field and we are seeing some of

602
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,099
that in horticultural lighting so it's

603
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:09,109
really good that we're all sharing the

604
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:10,789
same type of information and of course

605
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:12,379
my code bodies and utilities or giving

606
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,089
them trusted verified information as

607
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,680
well

608
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:19,759
the current specification that we've had

609
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:21,860
since October is version 1.2 the mean

610
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,900
minimum performance spec for DLC is

611
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:27,019
efficacy and in this case our efficacy

612
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,150
is 1.9 micromoles per Joule we have a 5%

613
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:31,670
lower tolerance so that products can

614
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,860
comply but any product that's less than

615
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:37,640
1.9 micromoles per Joule is not going to

616
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:39,409
be on the qpl our standards so when we

617
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,840
have a technical requirement we are

618
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:43,940
using is standards and asabi standards

619
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,399
and where to some extent limited by

620
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,350
those standards so for example liquid

621
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,780
cooled fixtures which we would like to

622
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:52,879
see on the QP l we don't have a standard

623
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:54,680
from a Saab yet that tells us how to

624
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,030
test and measure those fixtures so that

625
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,890
we know how to look at that reporting

626
00:23:56,029 --> 00:24:00,139
we're waiting for a sabi to complete

627
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:03,080
that process so that we can have liquid

628
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,540
cool fixtures on the QP l you can see

629
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:07,549
our technical requirements below we have

630
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:09,289
almost 70 products on the QP L which is

631
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:11,690
amazing considering that this has been

632
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:13,670
live for less than a year one of the

633
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,130
market actors as I mentioned before is

634
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,230
regulations from States so we have a

635
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,820
state compliance filter if you click on

636
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,250
the state compliance menu on the left

637
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:24,289
side you can actually filter the list by

638
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,450
either the Illinois regulations or the

639
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:29,819
Massachusetts regulations so for example

640
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:32,670
this is a screenshot from last week we

641
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:35,099
had 68 products on Thursday 52 of them

642
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,110
would comply with the Massachusetts

643
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:40,709
regulations for examples it's a very

644
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:42,059
easy way to see what works I want to

645
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,829
share some information about the data

646
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,649
with you this is the most current data

647
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:48,750
again 68 products as of last week there

648
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,730
is no relationship between efficacy and

649
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,289
light output so if you want high light

650
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,049
output products that are for example

651
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:57,119
equal 2000 watt HPS you can find them on

652
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:59,339
the qpl same f at the same or better

653
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,019
efficacy if you want low light output

654
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:02,250
products that are very close to the crop

655
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:03,839
that you would use for example and

656
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,180
vertical farming you can find those

657
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,279
products with high efficacy as well and

658
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,560
we have easily can see one for one

659
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,579
replacements in all the categories for

660
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,750
fixtures that are currently available

661
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:18,990
right now our average efficacy is 38%

662
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,970
higher than the most effective HP HP s

663
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,160
double ended products so you're seeing a

664
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,980
big jump and efficacy from commercial

665
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,170
products that are available now as I

666
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,170
said before the efficacy is higher than

667
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:34,970
HP s again it's it's 2.36 compared to

668
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:37,259
1.7 but it's only increasing slowly so

669
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,299
sometimes we hear claims about efficacy

670
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:41,339
increasing rapidly in terms of the

671
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:43,289
products that we see on the QP l we're

672
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:45,720
not seeing big improvements yet perhaps

673
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:48,359
we'll see them in a year

674
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,870
right now it's 24% higher than our

675
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,329
threshold of 1.9 if you filter the QP l

676
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:56,729
for these state regulations for example

677
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:59,849
Massachusetts you will find that that

678
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:02,700
regulation PPE is 16% higher than our

679
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:05,279
threshold 16% higher than 1.9 but what

680
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,019
happens is there are about a third of

681
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,119
the products fourth of the products on

682
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:10,740
our QP l that aren't compliant with

683
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,089
those regulations so you would

684
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,710
essentially filter out the products

685
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:15,269
which means for those manufacturers

686
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,910
there's reason to improve what they're

687
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:20,339
offering um one of the things that we

688
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,710
used to see a lot is sort of this

689
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:24,029
blurple yes heard of the term blurple or

690
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,610
pinkish light that you would see in

691
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:28,799
greenhouses a lot of the early LEDs only

692
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:30,449
had blue and red LEDs in them we're

693
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,549
seeing that change we're seeing a lot of

694
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:35,460
phosphor converted white LEDs with red

695
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:37,930
so you can see among the mix there's

696
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,140
lots of green content

697
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:43,269
is available among the fixtures about 30

698
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,670
on average the fixtures that we see on

699
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:48,940
the qpl have about a 35 percent green

700
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:50,590
component and have about 3% far red

701
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,690
components so there's very few of those

702
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:54,819
blurple fixtures on the qpl right now

703
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,500
there's no requirement that they have

704
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:58,029
Fox were converted white or white light

705
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,740
but that's the way the markets trending

706
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:03,460
and we're seeing that in the products

707
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:11,380
that are available and that is me my

708
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:14,500
contact information awesome so I'm

709
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:16,710
Lauren I mean emergent emerging

710
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:21,069
technologies and services manager at

711
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:23,230
efficiency Vermont so I test new

712
00:27:21,069 --> 00:27:26,619
emerging technologies and services not

713
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:28,990
just in the indoor AG space but in a lot

714
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:30,879
of different spaces I pilot those

715
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,819
technologies in Vermont with Vermont

716
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,250
customers and then if those pilots go

717
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:39,129
well then we implement those programs

718
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:41,529
across the state at a much larger scale

719
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:47,440
and in some cases in other jurisdictions

720
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:50,579
as well so this is more or less my

721
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,230
agenda I'll go through why we're seeing

722
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:56,230
current market increases in Vermont and

723
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,210
future market increases expected and

724
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,549
then I'll talk a little bit about some

725
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,549
programs we have as my colleagues

726
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:06,339
mentioned indoor grows greenhouses and

727
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:08,409
hemp are a really big reason for these

728
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:14,169
increases and we definitely see all of

729
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:16,660
those applications in Vermont so this is

730
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:19,029
where normally I'm presenting to a group

731
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:21,430
that's a little less interested in this

732
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:23,700
area and so this is where I say let's

733
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:26,259
get the elephant out of the room

734
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,019
cannabis legalization is becoming really

735
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:32,009
big about a third of Americans are now

736
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:35,859
living under fully recreation alized

737
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:38,910
cannabis and there's an urbanization

738
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:41,679
movement happening as well typically

739
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:44,519
younger more liberal folks are moving

740
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:48,610
from the Northeast across the US to get

741
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:51,650
cheaper housing and and a lot of and

742
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:54,199
better jobs so we're seeing this

743
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:57,740
this phenomenon really move across the

744
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,769
u.s. into states like Illinois as this

745
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:04,029
mentions another big thing for Vermont

746
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:07,099
was actually the farm bill in 2020 18

747
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:09,440
through the USDA we saw a bunch of hemp

748
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:11,240
come into the state since then and

749
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,150
actually Vermont's in a very unique

750
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,009
scenario where this is not a ballot

751
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,140
initiative it's a legislature initiative

752
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:20,210
so the legislature has kicked around the

753
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,670
idea of doing commercial legalization

754
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:25,549
with dispensaries and commercial grows

755
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,170
for about five years in a row and

756
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:28,879
they've never been able to pass it

757
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:32,180
they're actually debating it right now

758
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,870
in the Statehouse at this very moment so

759
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:39,049
it may pass this year and so we'll see

760
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:40,279
those commercials size grows come online

761
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:43,039
but it's been a really interesting

762
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:45,349
market to study because with the absence

763
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,349
of that large cannabis grow we're still

764
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:50,599
seeing a lot of CEA pop up in a lot of

765
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:51,919
different areas so it's been really

766
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:53,899
interesting to watch this kind of

767
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,960
fragmented market still move into the

768
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:01,220
CEI space even without that main cash

769
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:04,519
crop driver so some folks got into this

770
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:06,259
earlier but basically I use this case

771
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,639
study to describe to people that we

772
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:10,220
really need to scale up our food

773
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,080
production farmers need to harvest in

774
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,610
the next four decades the same amount of

775
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,849
food as the last eight thousand years

776
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:18,889
that means that we will be increasing

777
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:21,619
our greenhouse size greenhouses are

778
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:24,530
about are growing at about 20% year over

779
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:26,719
year across the US and in about 10%

780
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:29,180
Inlet area and I would venture to guess

781
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,470
that in Vermont it might even be faster

782
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:36,049
than this so this is Westland there was

783
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,819
another slide on it earlier but this is

784
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:40,190
just showing the scale at which we might

785
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:44,869
need to ramp up in order to keep this

786
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:46,970
food production going so in Vermont we

787
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:49,909
also have a big farm-to-table movement

788
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:52,730
people love out of season produce and

789
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:56,300
greens in the middle of the winter so

790
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:59,930
we're seeing a lot of folks use local

791
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:02,149
greens this is a case study from Peru

792
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:04,370
Vermont in southern Vermont this woman

793
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:06,940
grows microgreens

794
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:09,439
and ornamental flowers in her basement

795
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,480
we see a lot of these small medium

796
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,029
businesses popping up in addition to a

797
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,130
lot of the large cannabis grows that you

798
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:18,230
all have been talking about so this

799
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,690
woman sells her microgreens to a local

800
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:23,269
restaurant it's won a bunch of awards

801
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:25,789
for using local sustainable produce and

802
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:27,500
that's very common in our state so this

803
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:30,470
is actually upstate New York customer

804
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,359
right over the border but we also see a

805
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:34,370
lot of dairy farmers moving to hemp

806
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:36,319
historically they've had really low

807
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:38,239
margins or even negative margins in

808
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,950
recent years so moving to hemp is

809
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,660
actually a really great option for them

810
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,509
even if they don't make it they might

811
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,210
make more money than they did in dairy

812
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:49,940
which is a highly subsidized industry

813
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:52,370
dairy farmers at the most maybe make 3%

814
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:55,690
margin so these margins on hemp are much

815
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,689
much better if they do it right

816
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,720
the other thing is they have a lot of

817
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,380
lands we are really scarcely populated

818
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,880
State so a lot of these farmers have

819
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,280
hundreds of acres of land they have

820
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,010
growing experience they have facilities

821
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,399
that they haven't used for a while like

822
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:17,058
barns that they can dry the hemp in so

823
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:19,309
we see a lot of them transitioning also

824
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:21,740
climate resilience so this is the

825
00:32:19,308 --> 00:32:24,379
droughts in California the fires in

826
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:27,099
California the deep freeze in Chicago

827
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:29,780
this is a picture of some new Americans

828
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:32,480
going back to their plots after we had

829
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:35,178
Hurricane Irene a couple years ago that

830
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,039
flooded most of the state of Vermont and

831
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:40,009
I hear from these customers all the time

832
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,589
I can't predict the winters like I used

833
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:44,929
to I can't follow the Almanac anymore I

834
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:46,399
get random Frost's in the middle of May

835
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,470
that I never had to worry about before

836
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,500
so they're actively looking into

837
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:54,019
spending more energy in these

838
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:57,679
greenhouses or or usually greenhouses in

839
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:59,389
order to maintain their crop they can't

840
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,940
afford to lose a crop in the middle of

841
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:04,009
May due to a random frost and they never

842
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,779
really had that issue before so we're

843
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:09,230
hearing more about people trying to be

844
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:12,769
resilient with their with their grows

845
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,970
and really have backup systems so that

846
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:17,500
they can they can keep growing

847
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,500
regardless of what's happening outside

848
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:24,329
John touched on this a little bit as

849
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:25,859
well but in the utility space we have

850
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:28,589
been addicted to screw based lighting

851
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:31,709
for a long time it's been an easy market

852
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:33,839
it has given us a lot of great savings

853
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:36,659
per unit large volumes that are

854
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,398
residential and commercial scale but now

855
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:40,019
that that's over and baselines are

856
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:43,859
creeping on that we need to find a new

857
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:47,099
area to get savings and this indoor AG

858
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:48,959
market is a really great one we also see

859
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:51,359
that we're serving a lot of markets that

860
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,669
we normally wouldn't have touched people

861
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,398
like low income customers and renters

862
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:59,519
are some of the biggest home growers and

863
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:01,048
home grow is legal in Vermont so we do

864
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,028
see a lot of like small-scale

865
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:04,470
residential stuff happening and it's

866
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:06,118
really nice to be able to get your foot

867
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,608
in the door with a renter who obviously

868
00:34:06,118 --> 00:34:10,259
who can't really do other anything other

869
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:12,690
than screw based lighting in their space

870
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,819
so it's nice to be able to connect with

871
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:18,000
them and perhaps create more

872
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:19,710
relationships for a future state as I

873
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,989
mentioned we have creeping baselines so

874
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:25,260
as codes get more and more efficient

875
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:29,128
we're required to meet those codes and

876
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,659
give incentives on things above code so

877
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:32,639
this is getting harder and harder for us

878
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:36,740
as well and then this last one is really

879
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:40,289
important but utilities are moving from

880
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:42,898
reducing energy to being really creative

881
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:46,050
about when we use energy so it's often

882
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:49,828
about overall grid health now and carbon

883
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:52,050
in comparison to reduction of overall

884
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:54,869
use so we're doing a lot of pilots

885
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:57,149
around flexible load management carbon

886
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:59,460
impacts things like natural refrigerants

887
00:34:57,148 --> 00:35:01,559
that have really intense carbon

888
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,780
applications and for our distribution

889
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,909
utility partners the people who supply

890
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,890
the power because we're responsible for

891
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:11,219
saving the power as an efficiency

892
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:13,679
utility they really care about this they

893
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:16,588
want sustainable load growth and they

894
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,449
want people to be using energy during

895
00:35:16,588 --> 00:35:21,059
off-peak times because that's the

896
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:23,098
cleanest form of energy in the Northeast

897
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:24,900
we have a really really clean grid and

898
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:26,250
it's getting cleaner in Vermont we

899
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,068
actually buy a lot of power from

900
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,550
hydro-québec so that is completely

901
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:33,579
renewable and then we see

902
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:35,800
dirtier fuels come on to the market and

903
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:39,130
the distribution utilities are required

904
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,260
to buy things like coal when there is a

905
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:43,030
peak so we're really trying to avoid

906
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,130
those peaks and be creative with these

907
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,950
customers to understand how we keep them

908
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:50,079
off peak as they're growing with you

909
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:54,549
know thousand watt lights every couple

910
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:57,340
feet so now I'll talk about some

911
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:59,920
programs this is the first residential

912
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:02,950
indoor prescriptive program in the

913
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,289
country we developed it alongside

914
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:07,659
Burlington electric and it's available

915
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:12,789
for all Vermonters for residential grow

916
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:14,559
operations it can be any any type of

917
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:17,139
plant this is what our website looks

918
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:19,329
like it's a hundred dollars off an LED

919
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:22,089
grow light and it needs to meet the DLC

920
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:24,099
specifications we were also finding that

921
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,230
we were basically selling out of read a

922
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:28,900
I'm selling out of dehumidifiers in the

923
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:31,570
state so we're also really pushing the

924
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,280
dehumidifier rebates on energy star

925
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:37,990
dehumidifier because we know that people

926
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:40,030
are using those for gross so this is

927
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:42,189
what our rebate form looks like we'll

928
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,930
probably make it a lot more streamlined

929
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:47,380
in the future but we needed to start

930
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:48,969
somewhere so we offer $100 we get

931
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,190
minimal information back from the

932
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:53,289
customer so things like what wattage

933
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:56,440
were you replacing this with how many

934
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:58,090
growth cycles per year do you have do

935
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,920
you have cooling in your gross space

936
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,200
like do you use a window air conditioner

937
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,059
and our savings are related to those

938
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:06,549
things we're getting this information so

939
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:09,190
that we can hone our savings more and

940
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,990
create better solutions for customers in

941
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,210
the future you'll notice what we don't

942
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:15,579
ask is what are you growing we don't

943
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:17,199
care they're using energy it doesn't

944
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:19,239
matter we don't necessarily want that

945
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:22,000
information in our books of what they're

946
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:26,409
growing and this is really open to any

947
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,349
type of residential growers so this is

948
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:32,460
our savings calculations on what we

949
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:40,179
assumed for lighting and cooling savings

950
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:42,099
in the residential space and then these

951
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:43,449
are the assumptions of what we did for

952
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:46,089
baseline versus

953
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:49,179
new wattages so everything on the right

954
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:52,150
is products that are on our qpl and

955
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:54,369
actual wattages and on the left you can

956
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,860
see what we kind of assumed they were

957
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:58,210
replacing in those scenarios this is

958
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,970
something that we'll look back at once

959
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:04,720
we get more data from customers using

960
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:06,819
the rebate program to see are we correct

961
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:13,119
are they actually replacing a 600 watt

962
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:15,640
light with 345 and then I am super

963
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,059
excited to announce that we just came up

964
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:22,329
with a guide for greenhouse greenhouse

965
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:25,090
customers along with an initiative for

966
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:27,639
rebates around greenhouses right now

967
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:29,079
they're all custom basically what we'll

968
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,089
be doing is we'll be working with each

969
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:33,940
greenhouse customer to model their space

970
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:37,030
to understand the interactive effects of

971
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:40,960
lighting and HVAC and pumps and watering

972
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:42,790
and everything that's in that space we

973
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,599
have rebates for thermal currents

974
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:48,969
coverings like double polyethylene

975
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,699
heating systems both the system itself

976
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:53,319
and if you're using a efficient

977
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:57,069
distribution system like radiant

978
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:02,789
flooring LED grow lights greenhouse

979
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:06,070
controls ventilation motors and VFDs and

980
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:08,139
we will probably end up making some of

981
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,660
these prescriptive that was my original

982
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:11,949
goal with this but it's really hard to

983
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:13,690
make these things prescriptive we

984
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:16,079
started to go into these greenhouse

985
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:18,550
customers and they all had different

986
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,940
square footages different heating

987
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:23,950
systems different plans they were

988
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,869
growing different things so it was

989
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:29,259
really impossible at this stage to

990
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:30,759
create a prescriptive rebate program but

991
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,740
it's absolutely something that we're

992
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:36,520
interested in doing for this group

993
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:38,019
I could see thermal curtains VFD uses

994
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:40,119
more or less already prescriptive and

995
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:42,820
then LED grow lights as future

996
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,799
prescriptive offerings other things that

997
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,380
we'll be doing is looking into cryogenic

998
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,390
freezers that happened in processing and

999
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,970
whether we can do one for one

1000
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:53,769
replacements with those as well as

1001
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:55,779
drying recommendations we have a lot of

1002
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:56,110
people who are drying hemp themselves on

1003
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,390
their

1004
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:03,220
and they use a lot of propane and oil

1005
00:39:58,389 --> 00:40:05,769
and electricity to do that this is just

1006
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:08,059
a case study that I'm gonna go past but

1007
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:15,400
um thank you

1008
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:15,400
[Applause]
