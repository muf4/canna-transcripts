1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,190
we were in wonderland nursery on this

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,229
and Kevin Joe Murray and he is somebody

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,429
who's made this competition happen in

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,050
Northern California and Southern

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,359
California for the better part of the

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,059
year and he said he had something

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,570
special and wait he said there wasn't a

8
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:20,879
lot of fuel on the market

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,859
Gastein something that could dump me in

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,140
a commercial setting something that you

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,269
guys could all put your hands on I

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,518
talked to a few people are like yeah the

13
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:31,409
only stretch is to well you know

14
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,469
homegrown environment is could do well

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,950
anywhere I know that some of you know

16
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:44,039
this already but it was doc Walker

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,780
oh gee this is one of the mierqi knows a

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,890
dog walker I don't think that you can do

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,890
anything better out there

20
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:54,049
[Music]

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:06,930
[Music]

22
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:13,449
if we're wrong for carts if we're over

23
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:16,059
hash that's what matters when you grow

24
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:19,299
strong plants they tend to be very

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,310
chirpy very potent this is the first

26
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:52,060
time that we have ever had somebody

27
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:54,908
sweep both this contest meant more to me

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,909
than the commercial or medicinal

29
00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:00,310
facilities because it all comes down to

30
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:04,390
the home grower they're able to produce

31
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:06,840
medicine for themselves and always

32
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,610
having that peace of mind quality is

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,069
different once you have it at the source

34
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,920
in a sense he's the source he's creating

35
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:16,388
medicine for himself and to be able to

36
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:18,458
have that peace of mind and know

37
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:19,659
everything that goes into it it's a

38
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,269
whole different experience that people

39
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:23,439
don't know that goaded the dispensaries

40
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:26,319
even the people that are getting

41
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,599
medicinal quality products it's sent for

42
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,179
testing it goes to a packaging process

43
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:38,969
is handled multiple times you don't have

44
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:42,700
that same that visual luster definitely

45
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:45,430
it's just something about it being

46
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:47,289
straight one hand one set of hands and

47
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,420
that's it how many people show you their

48
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:51,068
jar weed and it's like it's better than

49
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,649
what you have it's you have something

50
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:57,310
that's never been crushed in a bag never

51
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,139
been you know mishandled it's it's it's

52
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,659
different I love it and I hate it cuz

53
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:04,419
now I look at so much weed and I'm like

54
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:07,030
such a critic and I'm it's like oh like

55
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:10,780
this is why I grow though you know like

56
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,579
I have to you know you'd be like I want

57
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,109
to see you be a millionaire if you just

58
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:15,459
tell somebody how to grow their weed

59
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:17,500
because you're just like this is just

60
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,789
not up to par I think it's just a lot of

61
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,680
love that goes into it

62
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:23,859
you know it's different it's not my job

63
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,230
it's just the thing I'd love to do

64
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,239
hello that's what brought me to it have

65
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:30,009
you ever grown commercially like no I

66
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,908
started growing less than two years ago

67
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:36,280
and just you know got a couple lights

68
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:38,259
and some I actually bought some cuts

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,378
from the store while I popped seeds and

70
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:44,189
my first cut run allegedly allegedly

71
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:52,318
yeah he allegedly

72
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:55,120
saw hypothetical so you know yeah no I

73
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,828
did less than two years in and uh you

74
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,900
know it's just it's just been a homegirl

75
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:07,480
like I I understand commercial and my

76
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:10,540
hair from Florida right yeah I for

77
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:13,328
twenty it'll be about two years we had

78
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:16,599
to smoke all my weed that I had left for

79
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:19,629
4/20 and then we packed our shit in the

80
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,549
car and we left and that was that was it

81
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:24,240
I just committed and that's the only way

82
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:28,120
you know I quit my day job and I was

83
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,389
just committed and thank God it so

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,430
paying off you know but I do a lot of

85
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:34,960
research and I do a lot of thinking on

86
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,728
top of that research cuz you can just

87
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,469
read all you want you can be told all

88
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:40,149
you want but what actually makes sense

89
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,090
in your head what it what makes sense

90
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:44,918
for your conditions your I think that's

91
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:47,500
what everybody gets wrong in my opinion

92
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:50,319
is they try to copy somebody else's

93
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,240
stuff and so do you it's it's you know I

94
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,969
was talking about this with families to

95
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,710
age technology it's not having things at

96
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,570
your graphs if it didn't exist in a

97
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:01,598
Webster's dictionary to me I had to used

98
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:03,728
my imagination and the thing is is you

99
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:07,269
run out of creativity but at the same

100
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:10,120
time it's always good to learn by

101
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:12,459
changing what you're doing to experience

102
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,810
new things meaning you may perfect

103
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,870
something you thought you have perfected

104
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:19,389
mm-hmm oh I never I've already learned

105
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,098
quickly that I'm always going to keep

106
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,590
learning like it's not this is a

107
00:05:21,098 --> 00:05:26,110
changing thing it's not even something

108
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,699
you can get perfected in my opinion

109
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,038
because of all the new technology all

110
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:32,408
the new science is coming out everything

111
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:35,318
we're learning for me I've always been

112
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:37,360
aqua grower you know as far as your

113
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,459
grill methods and the mediums and the

114
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,739
type of lighting you're using and even

115
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:44,889
the nutrients what goes into the

116
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:46,418
thinking of picking out each one of

117
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:48,968
those individual items because that's

118
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:51,549
that's really one of the things that

119
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:53,769
that growers use is their advantage it's

120
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,579
just like a chef you can get any brand

121
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:59,079
of pepper any brand of pan any brand of

122
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:01,988
olive oil it doesn't matter what it is

123
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:04,118
what what went into you choosing the

124
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:06,518
different types of media different

125
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:09,399
things that you use this time that's a

126
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:12,038
good question because it wasn't just you

127
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:15,338
know what what is everybody else running

128
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:17,139
I watched quite a few people grow a lot

129
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:19,569
of my friends grow some really good weed

130
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,569
so I had you know luckily a lot of

131
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:25,989
things to take from theirs and some

132
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:27,669
things not to take from theirs but a lot

133
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:29,738
of people were killing it with the mills

134
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:33,519
so I decided that I was going to run

135
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:35,738
that and you know organics it's

136
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,740
intimidating I'm not gonna lie they do a

137
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:41,948
lot of work with live soil and keeping

138
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,990
things just beautiful and I didn't go

139
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:48,848
that route for you know preference of

140
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:52,778
with Coco it's just it's easier and it

141
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:54,128
it helps with I call it a hydroponics on

142
00:06:52,778 --> 00:07:00,098
on training wheels

143
00:06:54,129 --> 00:07:01,959
exactly you hard over feed it's hard to

144
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:05,438
over water the water retentions are very

145
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:06,879
similar but you just don't have the

146
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,919
nutrients you have full control of

147
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,360
whatever you're putting into there yeah

148
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,299
that's that's the training wheels

149
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,709
no and that's it's true but it works

150
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:20,168
really well so it's like well if it's

151
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:21,939
working you know it's a lot more perfect

152
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:25,238
that won't work you gotta hook those

153
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:27,338
bags of soil you got you know my back

154
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:29,049
home growers are putting them in they're

155
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:30,879
putting them in black contractor bags

156
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,348
and hefty bags trying to smuggle them

157
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:37,800
into their apartment or house whatever I

158
00:07:34,348 --> 00:07:41,649
remember those days yeah I had a bag I

159
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,288
had a golf bag in a camping tent bag

160
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:45,730
that I could put two bottles of 20 pound

161
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:46,870
tanks of co2

162
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,520
and just bring him in there it was like

163
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,899
I was like golfing and I had like a bag

164
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:55,569

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,400
be that bad I'm all about taste I always

209
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,500

get me you know dumb high but it's it's

212
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:54,159
the flavor I smoke for because I'm gonna

213
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:58,149
get high regardless off of everything

214
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:59,730
and you know I just I really I really

215
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,980
love sativas but now

216
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,539
the did you treat this plant differently

217
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,178
this time I mean I didn't treat it

218
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:09,480
differently at all except for a veg I

219
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:11,488
was actually redoing my room and I got

220
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,339
kind of lazy with it kind of put the

221
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:16,798
time off and then we just came down to

222
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,619
it like alright this has to go into

223
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:21,899
flour to get sixty days and some dry

224
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:24,298
time and some cure time and it has to go

225
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,958
in today so it went in sixty days here

226
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:30,119
and I actually pulled it 57 yeah I

227
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,099
started to you know for whatever reason

228
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:34,319
I started to see it pull a couple little

229
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,480
nanners out and it's like I could pluck

230
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:39,868
up I could see what they do but I'm not

231
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,139
even gonna risk it you know so I pulled

232
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:44,579
it and worked out so I was get down

233
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,589
that's what I had me sketching the whole

234
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:49,108
time is you know did I pull too early

235
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:52,259
because everyone else is like oh we're

236
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:54,329
taking this really far I don't have time

237
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:56,188
for that you know people talk about

238
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:58,229
looking at the trichomes with the

239
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:01,108
microscope and stuff and for me on a

240
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:04,259
commercial level we don't really do that

241
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:06,629
we look at a monthly calendar and if

242
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:09,659
that's day we need to pull we pull yeah

243
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:11,519
I also look at people like Moxie who

244
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,798
make a lot of concentrates and you know

245
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,698
they get you know bashed for pulling

246
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:18,629
early but we pull early and it's always

247
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:20,308
concentrates is different though well I

248
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:23,188
like concentrates so that's you know

249
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:25,249
where most of mine goes so you know

250
00:11:23,188 --> 00:11:27,238
that's that's what I prefer to smoke

251
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:31,859
what kind of lighting news

252
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:33,629
I used Phantom de's HPS that that girl

253
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:36,720
off plant was growing under 500 watts

254
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:39,629
yeah took up the whole 4 by 4 space it

255
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,668
was you know because of the issue in the

256
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:43,709
beginning they gave everybody a little

257
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:46,649
bit more time so I use that for veg

258
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:50,308
would not get for you about a pound and

259
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:53,609
a half yeah for a 4 by 4 for 4 by 400

260
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:59,129
500 watts what kind of pot Gigi 10

261
00:11:53,609 --> 00:12:00,899
gallon smart pot meeting as far as the

262
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:03,119
amount of water saturation per day

263
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:05,609
leaders gallons how much did you feed

264
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:08,069
the plant per day uh so I always just

265
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:10,679
you know the feed for about 30 seconds

266
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:12,179
and then let it sit go to another plant

267
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:14,759
come back irrigation

268
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:17,009
no this is hand feed yeah I'm on a wand

269
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,139
I have been like for me back in the day

270
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:20,939
I would be like every one second counts

271
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:24,240
different I'd be like one two three four

272
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,400
five six feel like my starts slow and

273
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:31,350
starts uh you know getting faster

274
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:33,240
towards the know you know I tried but

275
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,220
I've got a TD so like even if I'm

276
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,960
counting there I'm gonna be like okay

277
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,580
well what is this like in there buddy

278
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,920
what I'm Han Feeny I would always jiggle

279
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:45,870
the pie one hand you know the retention

280
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:48,149
so I'll hit it for like 30 seconds and

281
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:51,299
move on to another pot and I usually do

282
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:53,250
like two rounds and the next time I give

283
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:56,009
it water until I start to see just a

284
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:59,339
drop start dripping out for runoff and

285
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:01,379
let whatever runs off of there you know

286
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:04,470
one leading per day yeah one feeding

287
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:07,200
firt it starts out usually every two

288
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,600
three days and then yeah towards the end

289
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,720
it's you know I'm hitting it every day

290
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:17,550
every day any teas do you flush once a

291
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,980
week I flush well I do you know to feed

292
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:23,069
days and then the third time is just

293
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,700
water in Cal mag and my future would be

294
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:31,050
like a Monday feed when Wednesday like a

295
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,160
Friday and then so every so I just take

296
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,219
care of my flush is that way I never

297
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,899
have like a set you know flush every two

298
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,850
weeks or whatever but I will hit it a

299
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,309
little harder my secrets on your flush

300
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,889
what would you flush with no these are

301
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:46,489
secrets just water just water yeah all

302
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:48,838
right so I'm just uh you know I'm just

303
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,330
what do you think people using flushing

304
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,560
agents of different things I've you know

305
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,930
I've heard different things and I've

306
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,609
tried you know something that one person

307
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:58,528
said was good and then the other person

308
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,629
says well that's how you you know kill

309
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:04,559
your plant I'm like well you know kinda

310
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:08,338
is the goal here but not really but you

311
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:10,559
know do you run off you're like this in

312
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,120
your head looking for me it's about

313
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,729
reading plants and if you're hand

314
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,259
feeding sometimes it may be telling me

315
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,330
there oh you know getting too much water

316
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:19,679
I start backing off you know won't run

317
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:22,560
them till run off and then I'll switch

318
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,939
up my flush schedule but for the most

319
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,639
part I noticed that most play

320
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,920
we'll stay on the same regimen if you

321
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,319
have a good regiment you know like it's

322
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,899
some plants are finicky but I also stay

323
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,830
away from those plants we got enough

324
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:40,299
heaters that are easier to grow and you

325
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,210
know like to work with you a little bit

326
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:45,519
better so so when you fed it this time

327
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,530
how many different varieties of plants

328
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,159
were you sharing the same reservoir feed

329
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:54,129
with three different okay are they all

330
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:56,169
indica hybrid sativa one of them is a

331
00:14:54,129 --> 00:15:00,189
sativa leaning the other one's a

332
00:14:56,169 --> 00:15:02,319
jet-fuel cross with fabuloso and other

333
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,380
one was to grow off so well you know

334
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,900
what the grow off being an OG for me

335
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:09,759
I've always laughed at the OG string

336
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,340
because I feel like so many people put

337
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:15,909
names on it and it doesn't matter it

338
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:18,399
could be my better than your OG this one

339
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:21,370
dog walker OG whatever it may be it's an

340
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,129
OG but in our minds we look for a gassy

341
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,230
diesel II kind of piney strain when it

342
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:29,379
comes to an OG I mean have you grown oh

343
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,289
geez before and away from them to be

344
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:33,789
honest everyone gives me shit for

345
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:36,730
growing the more fruity flavors more

346
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:38,709
sativa flavors but you know that's what

347
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,680
I like I'm not gonna grow because what

348
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,300
you like I'm smoking this stuff so if

349
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,559
you want to smoke my bag then you're

350
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:49,629
gonna smoke it I grew and that's I

351
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:52,449
what's nice is that uh you know I became

352
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:58,240
friends with a seed bank who loves

353
00:15:52,450 --> 00:16:01,210
edibles so Oregon elite great guy great

354
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,629
company and he's made it very easy for

355
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:07,269
me to get my hands on seeds and I just

356
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:09,070
haven't stopped popping them you know

357
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:10,779
there's people who give me shit for it

358
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,600
other people are like you know pop my

359
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:16,449
seeds it's hard because out of ten

360
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,670
twelve whatever many seeds you have you

361
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:21,520
have to track the data for each one of

362
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:23,949
those seeds and see how each phenotype I

363
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,799
always tell people it's like you know

364
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:29,110
seeds are like parents you may have the

365
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,549
same mom the same father and I've always

366
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,529
referred to it as the Michael Phelps

367
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:35,049
theory in my head Michael Phelps has

368
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,149
shed you know he smoked weed one of the

369
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:37,990
most gold medals you know so when I look

370
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,340
at plants

371
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,560
whether it's taking the most amount of

372
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,899
clones for strain or even popping seeds

373
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:46,509
who's our Michael Phelps of the family

374
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:48,459
and the thing is is so many different

375
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:51,460
attributes go in to finding the

376
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,530
different fie knows of a strain and you

377
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,360
know picking those out really comes down

378
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:58,329
to not personal opinion at a commercial

379
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,029
level it's it's public opinion so you're

380
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,830
looking what the market wants and you

381
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:04,480
know when it comes down to whether it's

382
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,750
selecting different fie nose or clones

383
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,329
what's your process like for me you know

384
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,980
if I had to plant ten plants I was

385
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,599
taking fifty cuts and I was throwing

386
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,910
away quite a bit of cuts just to find

387
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:19,599
the ones that were accelerating the most

388
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:22,509
at the beginning yeah I mean if I can I

389
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,369
do that but you know sometimes space is

390
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:27,940
limited on moms and you know it's just

391
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:30,309
you take the cuts you can run and as

392
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,039
long as you you know give them the right

393
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:35,470
love most of them you know turn out well

394
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,599
but I don't go for what the market wants

395
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,370
everybody you know picks up what the

396
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,659
next best thing is and sometimes what I

397
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:43,419
like is the next best thing

398
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,430
but that's pure you don't have the

399
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,529
millions of dollars marketing I feel

400
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,850
like some shit gets so hyped up you know

401
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:51,220
I don't know about you but I feel like

402
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:57,069
it really gets hyped up and you've

403
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:58,839
actually seen you're like dude like I

404
00:17:57,069 --> 00:18:00,309
can hype up something all day you know

405
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:03,039
I've always been a Salesman but it's

406
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:05,319
like it doesn't matter as long as it's

407
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,569
fired the markets gonna like it anyways

408
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:09,909
so grow what you like and there are

409
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:12,519
gonna be people that you know grow or

410
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,800
that like what you grow I don't go after

411
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:18,190
the the gorilla glue craze the writing

412
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,319
cake craze it's not like that my mint

413
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,509
lemonade is what's your ultimate dream

414
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,950
in this do you want to grow for a living

415
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:26,980
do you want to own your own type of

416
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,450
facility to grow see for me it's always

417
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,390
been a dream to me to do what you love

418
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,309
and you know I see all in the reason I

419
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:36,340
bring up marketing is is there's so many

420
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:38,710
strains are so hyped up that I feel like

421
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:41,559
people don't get a true sense of what is

422
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,809
actually good cannabis and the thing is

423
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,369
is if we don't have the type of money we

424
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:47,019
don't have the type of followers it's

425
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:49,689
not put out there and people get hyped

426
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:51,548
up and I think we all get caught up

427
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,759
sometimes no matter what it is

428
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,759
life

429
00:18:57,308 --> 00:19:02,079
did you know purple punch it has a

430
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:04,179
visual and smell appeal that's amazing

431
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,480
so I think it's it's almost like the

432
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:11,909
Blue Dream I mean that will knock me on

433
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:15,190
my ass purple punch not so much for me

434
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:17,200
you know maybe it's and I always say

435
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,489
maybe I haven't had the right one you

436
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,980
know it's crazy you know it's actually

437
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:22,989
indica dominant it's granddaddy purple

438
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,730
and Larry OG so you think if you cross

439
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:27,399
those two would be you know would

440
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,319
actually have a punch it doesn't you

441
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:31,628
know it's crazy too but you'll find the

442
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:34,298
people that do love it and that's what

443
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:36,069
you know the market is the market is the

444
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:38,950
market and as long as you grow it well

445
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:41,378
somebody's gonna like it and you know

446
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,850
people say Blue Dream is a hype strain

447
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:44,528
and they don't want it or whatever I

448
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,898
grow some blue dream you're gonna want

449
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:48,249
it you know like there's it's gonna turn

450
00:19:46,898 --> 00:19:50,528
out good it's gonna be his work be

451
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:52,569
amazing it's like very weight and if I

452
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:54,519
don't tell you it's blue dream you're

453
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:56,829
not even gonna you know some people

454
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:58,538
might but all the people that oh I don't

455
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,980
like blue dream half the people you put

456
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:03,249
blue dream in their face they're gonna

457
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,319
be like Oh what is this so it has a bag

458
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:07,239
appeal and it has a smell and I think

459
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:09,970
that's what sells a lot of times and

460
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:12,278
really at the end of the day everybody

461
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,839
has a different body and everybody's

462
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,608
gonna accept things differently it's

463
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,378
just like alcohol or anything else you

464
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:18,999
put in your body you're gonna react

465
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:21,189
differently some people can have spicy

466
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:24,009
food some people can some people will

467
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,778
you know have alcohol and they act you

468
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:28,239
know normal and some people fall asleep

469
00:20:25,778 --> 00:20:30,368
some people act like an asshole and they

470
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:33,220
act violent and crazy and they black out

471
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:36,038
so the thing is is is finding out what

472
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,019
works for you and you know I think that

473
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:41,048
so many people discount different

474
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:42,489
strains because something's hyped up to

475
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:44,829
where they need to open their mind it's

476
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:47,909
like really it's all about full spectrum

477
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:51,519
full spectrum is everything all right

478
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:53,619
it's just I don't go for what people

479
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,819
hype up and I think a lot of people hate

480
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:58,058
me for that or what's your favorite

481
00:20:54,819 --> 00:21:01,408
stream my mint lemonade lemon G and

482
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:03,308
cinnamon cookies my sin city and that's

483
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:05,470
basically what I'm referring to when

484
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:09,908
people will tell you

485
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:13,048
what is it like man it it's nothing but

486
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:20,230
that old-school lemon just strong lemon

487
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:21,970
train that kind of I think lemon GE you

488
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,529
know like I that's what I'm comparing it

489
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,419
to is the lemon G we had a lot of lemon

490
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:27,038
G in Florida as concentrates when

491
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:29,890
concentrates at the market

492
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,200
somebody flooded down there with lemon

493
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,990
Jeter pea batter this is what I started

494
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,590
on and you know I found a shop that had

495
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:40,599
a glass nail on a dry Jay hook and I

496
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:42,730
went to town everyone's like what are

497
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,928
you smoking you know at these parties

498
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,880
I'm sitting there with a blowtorch

499
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:50,740
they're like I think he's going on there

500
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:52,240
you know but it was you know I I love

501
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,798
that lemon G and that's what really got

502
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,460
me on it and then when I went to

503
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:57,519
Colorado

504
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,950
they had this you know 92 lemon OG that

505
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,639
I was like I hit a dab of it and I said

506
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:04,509
this is it

507
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,759
I'm like how they say 92 yeah whatever I

508
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:08,970
don't think Oh G existed to most people

509
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:12,970
by 92 by the story of it so it's just

510
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:15,190
very true I just you know that's that's

511
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:18,069
what I found and I was like holy crap

512
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:21,400
this is the you know smell again and the

513
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:24,819
taste that I found and so I just started

514
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,190
popping lemon seeds and lemon tree all

515
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:31,269
these other ones I didn't find what I

516
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:33,909
was looking for this cinnamon cookies

517
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:38,319
and lemon G cross is the closest I've

518
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:40,150
found I've found I've actually for a

519
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,710
while I was the only one that I could

520
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,900
find that had popped some and then now

521
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:47,350
I'm seeing a couple you know yeah or

522
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,940
grew it enough to post it or some of the

523
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:50,918
oh geez that just don't post you know

524
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,909
who knows that could be crushing it in a

525
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:57,190
closet somewhere but uh that's nobody

526
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:58,900
really agrees with me that mint lemonade

527
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,400
is their favorite you know I got a few

528
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,320
buddies that do but most people call me

529
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,500
crazy and they're like where's you know

530

532
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,359
it's not my style

533
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:11,798
they're the same friends you could

534
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:13,178
probably give them ten different oh geez

535
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:15,849
they couldn't name each one of them

536
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:18,580
anyway yeah you know I've got some I've

537
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:19,149
got some og connoisseurs that just don't

538
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:21,129
like what

539
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,330
I grow and I respect it it is what it is

540
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,850
I grow what I like

541
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:26,589
they grow what they like when we smoke

542
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:28,750
if if it's not what we want to smoke

543
00:23:26,589 --> 00:23:33,039
we'll roll up our own yeah you know who

544
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:34,779
cares I'm not I'm not in any competition

545
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,509
with anybody I just want to do what I

546
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:39,670
love like you said and that's I quit my

547
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:42,308
day job to come out here and you know

548
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:44,680
chase my edible dreams it's my you know

549
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:56,859
growing dream and you're gonna have to

550
00:23:44,680 --> 00:24:00,460
pick a dream yeah I have all sorts of

551
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:03,339
ideas you know I'm always constantly

552
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,380
trying to find something that's with the

553
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:07,928
edibles I do chase the market that that

554
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,840
is something I don't want the cookies

555
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:12,070
the brownies the gummi bears I don't

556
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,409
think the market does either but they

557
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:16,509
don't have much of a choice you know

558
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:19,450
they they want those but they want

559
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:22,929
something else and the problem is with

560
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:25,990
the baked goods is the shelf life and so

561
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:28,390
I've started making chewing gum that

562
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,670
we're trying to get into the ten

563
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:34,450
milligram bracket of recreational

564
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:36,700
because it will hit you better you're

565
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,529
absorbing it instead of digesting it and

566
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,140
so you're getting a little more bang for

567
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:44,889
your buck on the 10 milligram limit that

568
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,420
recreational sets and I also have home

569
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,940
do you have to chew gum to get the 10

570
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:55,330
milligrams I'm curious you know that I'm

571
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:57,580
not sure you know I do do you get higher

572
00:24:55,329 --> 00:25:01,089
if you swallow it that's a test we need

573
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:02,829
to take but I like it because it's it's

574
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:07,470
easy to microdose you know chewing gum

575
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:07,470
only lasts 10 15 minutes tops

576
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:16,689
no I I just I run chewing gum and I've

577
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,960
got some other ideas for the rec market

578
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:22,539
because of that 10 milligram limit the

579
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,690
ropes my sweet and sour ropes I just

580
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:28,809
don't see being bite-sized I I have them

581
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:30,730
bite-size and we will go after the

582
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:33,869
market with bite-size but you might have

583
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:36,549
people like me think I'm saving calories

584
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:37,839
very true and you can't you know I'm

585
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:39,250
trying to get skinny but I don't want to

586
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,009
get too skinny because you can't trust

587
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,599
the skinny candy man that's that's what

588
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:48,400
I've always heard shout out Claude the

589
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:51,369
candy man you know it's just it is what

590
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,820
it is with that market I'm chasing what

591
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:56,589
other people aren't tackling and shelf

592
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:59,829
life is what I'm going for as well

593
00:25:56,589 --> 00:26:01,959
because people you know they have to

594
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:03,369
refrigerate these cookies that still

595
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,460
have this it's not like you can make

596
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:09,039
this stuff on demand you know the thing

597
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,230
is is if it was a perfect world it'd be

598
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,089
like a farmers market you know

599
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,160
especially for home growers like you did

600
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:17,679
tonight it's like you know there should

601
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,690
be a home Growers Association it's like

602
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,670
people that are not gardening to a

603
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,430
commercial level should be able to grow

604
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:27,640
within their means or actual state legal

605
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:30,240
it means and be able to trade or barter

606
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:33,220
or sell their goods within a community

607
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,470
without having the same stipulations as

608
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,120
a commercial cultivation because let's

609
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,130
face it it's not like you're doing it to

610
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,919
survive a lot of people that are doing

611
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:44,520
things for cultivating at home is for

612
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,570
themselves I smoke a lot and I'm not

613
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,309
trying to buy all the boof from the

614
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:51,669
store you know that's that's the problem

615
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:53,109
I I do still I I grow at home I grow my

616
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,550
own stuff and then I still want to smoke

617
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:56,529
other people's stuff I'm not you know

618
00:26:54,549 --> 00:27:01,899
I'm not the best grower out there and

619
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:03,730
tonight but but let's just put it out

620
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,490
there I had a premonition that I was

621
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:09,009
gonna win when I did way before and I

622
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,779
did I told you tonight before you won I

623
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:13,509
think you're gonna win did I not I've

624
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:15,789
been telling everybody that I was gonna

625
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:18,430
win from the start because you got a you

626
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:21,609
know hey it's all about mental you know

627
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:24,009
for me it's mental strength II you know

628
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:25,899
it's not being cocky it's having

629
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,400
confidence in yourself yeah and if you

630
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,300
don't have confidence in yourself then

631
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,000
what's the point

632
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:33,369
like I chase the dream because I was

633
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,950
confident you know and I I waited as

634
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:37,839
well I should have been out here years

635
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,630
before I did I waited because I was

636
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,129
listening to other people tell me that

637
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:45,880
it's not gonna work you know it's too

638
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,870
hard for you why like why didn't I ask

639
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,010
myself why before

640
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:51,609
that I was like you know you're probably

641
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:54,039
right like kicking myself for that you

642
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:56,829
know but I finally had the

643
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:58,899
self-confidence to come out here do the

644
00:27:56,829 --> 00:28:02,679
damn thing and how'd you hear about the

645
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:04,690

plants like it did

689
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:06,639
you got to look at vibrational patterns

690
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:09,129
and tectonic plates and frequency and

691
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,620
