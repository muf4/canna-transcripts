[Music]

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,638
okay so it seems like it's working I

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,070
have your copy

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,070
we've just been chipping away at fine

5
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:17,550
[Music]

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,260
even French you do your part of that

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,400
actually put it on post this shit

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,810
Frenchie let's say shit

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,459
he's the quasar ambassador alright so

10
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:30,960
tell me what tell me what's currently in

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,989
here okay in here we currently have lava

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,549
cake derivative a wedding cake

13
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:38,369
Afghani I mean they're all empty now but

14
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:41,459
and then double sour OG super Sour

15
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:58,799
Diesel and purple cookies okay all

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:01:03,799
together takes a second but I think once

17
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,799
this thing gets pumped in yeah

18
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,908
I should have brought more I didn't

19
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:17,209
realize that you really need to put my

20
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:18,890
20 grams in there 20 grams I think

21
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:22,189
because I brought about 15 so I don't

22
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:29,509
think there's enough instructions for

23
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:31,640
the quasar be like fYI I really feel

24
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:34,519
that it might know is the chirps I guess

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,618
I know some of the raw line is very

26
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:38,739
chirpy because we don't oxidize it we

27
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:40,789
don't care it traditionally yeah I think

28
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:43,849
that's what everyone's smelling no out

29
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:45,560
of the Terps yeah yeah so you're getting

30
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:46,939
a lot of super Sour Diesel and palms

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,640
again Lego jump in

32
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:52,939
yeah it gets gets that gets my teardrop

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,670
yeah yeah yeah that's awesome I love it

34
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:58,478
me too I love this machine I like what

35
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,399
you're saying the 2j like bringing the

36
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:06,709
about the this will give me back to the

37
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:08,739
different types of rosin oh yeah this is

38
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,978
take taking away from the the newer yeah

39
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:13,009
okay

40
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,170
I'm so when we when we do the with the

41
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:17,449
cold water hash especially when it's not

42
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:19,488
fresh rose and it's that our traditional

43
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:22,238
a flavor it most of the time it comes

44
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:25,370
out pretty stable I've been very stable

45
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,730
yeah super stable but but that's laughs

46
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,039
but that's cool guys yeah so this is

47
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:32,988
your hash rosin then huh it is but it's

48
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,780
not what we make for Kelly hash so Kelly

49
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:37,849
hash for hash rosin is made from live

50
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,560
material fresh frozen live material

51
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:40,849
we're pressing what we stuck in here I

52
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,829
wish I'd showed it to you but it's our

53
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:44,590
raw line so we have two lines that Kelly

54
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:48,439
has we have a press line in a raw line

55
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,879
so our raw line is just we don't cure it

56
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,789
traditionally we cure it in a vacuum

57
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,349
freezer so it never oxidizes so what

58
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:56,539
that does is it preserves the tur

59
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,129
profile and that's the whole point of

60
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,669
our raw line is for people to enjoy the

61
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:00,530
terpenes

62
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:02,328
whereas our press lines are people to

63
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,799
enjoy the CBN and they Ridge and the

64
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:05,810
hashing profile in the hash she

65
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,269
entertained so that's where they're

66
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:13,759
different and so what are you pressing

67
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:16,069
it on we press on wood boards and we use

68
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,298
and oh actually we literally press on

69
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,810
what words will we put plastic in

70
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:21,270
between so your

71
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,800
using like a prep no no we do a little

72
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,010
bit of an old squee do the friend she

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,849
was with glass bottles that was hated

74
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:31,889
water yeah no I mean this is what we do

75
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:34,019
is it's a lot of is artisinal and I mean

76
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,059
some of the labs that I work with get

77
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,040
annoyed at me because they want to you

78
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,170
know mechanize the process more and use

79
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,729
presses like that so when I see what you

80
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:44,488
do they're like dude we could totally

81
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,859
you know you do 50 grams at a time

82
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,129
that's it no we could do 500 a time no

83
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,220
no it's MIT and it does destroy it the

84
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:55,789
end is I mean the the fact that it's

85
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,810
artisanal and the fact that it's so

86
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:59,939
idiosyncratic to each different strain

87
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,219
specific and different size trichomes

88
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,259
you really have to treat it like a

89
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,060
little baby you know I have to baby the

90
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:07,560
but if you want it to be the perfect

91
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,110
representation of it you have to really

92
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,479
treat it right every step of the way I

93
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,190
taste it really good but I definitely

94
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,060
taste that the hash the how a machine

95
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:21,769
chirping machine I taste a little like

96
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:27,930
kind of blueberry dream okay I'm still a

97
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:31,199
dream that's awesome but so what what's

98
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:34,829
specifically happening when you when you

99
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,310
take that what look like dry sift right

100
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:41,370
yep

101
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:44,038
and you press it is it creating a better

102
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:48,978
flavor is it create like what makes it

103
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,978
in what ways is it better and why not

104
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:56,459
well so look I mean why is rosin better

105
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:59,339
you know it's preference i it is

106
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:00,659
preference someone say it's a look when

107
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:02,250
you're dealing with even the most

108
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,580
premium hash and we haven't talked about

109
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:08,788
710 labs but we have to if we're gonna

110
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:10,769
talk about hash so 710 labs based out of

111
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:14,909
Colorado originally now in three or four

112
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:18,000
states including Callie one of my top

113
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:21,840
companies I have listed as you know that

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,228
I want to I can take my hat off to put

115
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,299
it that way

116
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:25,589
they're doing an amazing job and they've

117
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,930
done an amazing job from the beginning

118
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:30,299
coming in from the solvent world - right

119
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,000
no they were solving this from the

120
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,829
beginning yeah I mean they do so

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,720
they drew butane now as well but their

122
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:38,969
their hope I think in the beginning you

123
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,830
might be correct way off my knowledge

124
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,420
only goes back three years with them so

125
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:45,269
honestly my only knowledge is like -

126
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,400
yeah yeah I heard from Colorado when

127
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:49,889
they were starting to make waves and but

128
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,229
but yeah they're they're they're premium

129
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:54,870
product that's made with fresh frozen

130
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,910
material it's testing on average between

131
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:01,410
80 and 90 percent total cannabinoids

132
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,150
which is incredible but that product is

133
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,320
uh it's selling for one hundred and

134
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:08,819
fifty dollars a gram yeah so it's just a

135
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,500
different thing but that product I

136
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,629
implore you not to smoke it in a quasar

137
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,399
is smoking in something like that you

138
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:16,110
know and and that is the difference you

139
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,819
know and and again going back to the

140
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,800
differences a little bit between rosin

141
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,680
and cold water and why and why and what

142
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,668
it comes down to plant material so

143
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,129
within hash traditional hash and and and

144
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:30,769
in cold water hash you have retained

145
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,149
some of the plant material in

146
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:35,639
traditional Moroccan dry Civ taged it's

147
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:37,409
around seventy sixty percent in cold

148
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,019
water house currently it's between forty

149
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,970
and thirty now with live product like

150
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,918
seven ten what they do and want some of

151
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,680
the higher-end it's just seven ten right

152
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,299
now really where they're making premium

153
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,069
level cold water hash and they're

154
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,169
getting a single source single source

155
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,089
eighty five percent and above they're

156
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:55,769
using fresh frozen material and again

157
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:57,989
they're getting eighty five all indoor -

158
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:59,579
and it's and that only has what ten

159
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,110
percent plant material and that plant

160
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:05,060
material is like strictly like a little

161
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:08,280
bit of lipids and not much so you know

162
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,918
the point is that at every different

163
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:13,019
level you can consume the product

164
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,579
differently like we have perfect

165
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:17,099
examples in front of us you wouldn't

166
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:20,250
want to put 20 grams of rosin and a

167
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,460
quasar it just just just wouldn't rip me

168
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,899
and it could but it lends itself to

169
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,019
smoking with a little bit of plant

170
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:30,359
material which is so it's a better smoke

171
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:32,519
with little plant material yeah and this

172
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,020
is a good example but the best example

173
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,159
is you know where hair isn't a puff guy

174
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:39,149
you wouldn't want any plan that's here

175
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,560
none no in fact it's a ya know one you

176
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:43,389
wouldn't know you would never smoke hood

177
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,959
you can but you're gonna have to clean

178
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:48,789
yeah but um yeah so for dabbing and

179
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,279
that's the whole idea behind dabbing is

180
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,020
your your accessing or behind rosin and

181
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,549
hash crosses your you're accessing the

182
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:57,099
dabby market you're getting your product

183
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,740
to ninety percent total cannabinoids and

184
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,860
no plant material really just lipids and

185
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,500
fats and so on a daily basis what are

186
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,770
you doing um I don't smoke so much

187
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:13,000
anymore okay I'm uh got in my pocket

188
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:14,979
here I'm a t-shirt man now so yeah and

189
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,019
I'm Dre I hate to admit it but I'm doing

190
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,879
anyone between 1,000 and 2,000

191
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:22,060
milligrams a day so I'm doing a lot of

192
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,730
tincture but but yeah tincture anybody's

193
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,410
welcome to it just popping just drop it

194
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,870
in on yeah I'd say a whole drawerful is

195
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,689
about a hundred milligram fifty

196
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,399
milligrams just like that just like that

197
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:35,100
mcg only Hashem only and where do we

198
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,899
have a line coming out of this as well

199
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,830
different company than Kalahari tastes

200
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,039
like a plan

201
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:44,320
now of course it's very strong you see

202
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,569
an effect more of a body high it's like

203
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,890
an edible but I've actually found it to

204
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,320
be better than a lot of edibles cuz you

205
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:53,319
metabolize you metabolize a brownie in a

206
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,090
cookie one way but you metabolize an oil

207
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,150
slightly differently it's slightly

208
00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:00,190
quicker you know MCT oil person

209
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:01,809
specifically and specifically is very

210
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,000
bioavailable so you actually absorb it

211
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:05,649
very quickly so I have that's kind of

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,330
where I've come to the conclusion on the

213
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:10,059
difference where I feel between an

214
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,290
edible and a tincture they're similar so

215
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,879
when people ask me like is it like it

216
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:16,240
takes time like yes it's like a tincture

217
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,830
but I found that even you know edibles

218
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,870
will get me a little bit more mom down

219
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,879
tincture gives me energy

220
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,620
I don't get a lot of couch lock and

221
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,960
edibles you can't really time it that

222
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,820
much no yeah good good hash of the ball

223
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,009
I don't care who you are though let's

224
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,629
put you on your ass

225
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:33,980
happen before they did something you

226
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:35,929
metabolize it so slowly and

227
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,029
yeah back when they were on the market

228
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:43,609
like the edibles I grew up they got 500

229
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:45,740
milligram or a thousand milligrams entry

230
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,019
into the into cannabis right so you have

231
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,409
people who are like what seriousness is

232
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:52,819
usually pretty heavy its legal like let

233
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:55,399
me eat a cookie and that person just

234
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,710
like whole white-knuckling holding on

235
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,449
yeah but it is relative in person a

236
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,639
person with edibles than it is smoking

237
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,740
like I have friends they can smoke as

238
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,960
much as I can but they eat 30 milligrams

239
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,759
in there hi I need five six hundred

240
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,440
milligrams to be satisfied I need a

241
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,439
thousand plus to actually use don't

242
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,030
so it's everyone's body breaks like that

243
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,610
differently so when you're ingesting

244
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:17,990
it's far different but but I find an

245
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,629
interesting so you're saying you don't

246
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,730
smoke almost at all anymore like you

247
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:25,220
don't like the ritual to taste the

248
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,019
flavor I smoke my children let's be

249
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:31,420
clear I still smoke still addicted I'm a

250
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:31,419
Spaniard smoking since I was like eight

251
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,160
yeah it's so bad but it really is true

252
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:45,049
no so we're really were smoking quite

253
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,700
young so anyway I still am addicted to

254
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:48,559
the act of smoking I truly do enjoy it

255
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,060
but I just smoke a chill oh I smoked the

256
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,449
little chill I'm not that biggest why do

257
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:55,309
you smoke that chill I'm all day long no

258
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,259
literally I'll smoke maybe a half a gram

259
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:59,479
on a big day but usually a quarter of a

260
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:02,960
gram a hash so it's probably 20 hits in

261
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:09,110
total over the course of a whole day and

262
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:14,180
what about you like what what are you

263
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:15,800
like are you using the clock I mean it's

264
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:18,649
a sense it depends what I'm doing and

265
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,019
where I am let's say you're at work if

266
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:22,939
I'm at if I'm at work

267
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:29,590
I'll take dabs because it's a little

268
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:33,200
quicker so I'll dab the hash yeah yeah

269
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:36,620
and but I mean I also I like smoking the

270
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,379
hash with flour a lot I also smoke by I

271
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,639
mean Spanish are you doing tobacco I do

272
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,590
once in a while but I can't smoke

273
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,199
tobacco anymore you know my lung flower

274
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,389
done all makes I can't smoke a joint

275
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,280
without hash

276
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:50,710
like I have to always mix my hash in my

277
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,740
flour in fact Cali hash is releasing in

278
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:57,040
three weeks a complete line of pre rolls

279
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,470
that are infused all strain specific on

280
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,759
the hash and the weed side and we're

281
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,220
gonna have a lot of fun with that and

282
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,870
we've signed on with some I can't name

283
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,330
who it is and all these people we sign

284
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,700
we potentially have some new new some

285
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:12,310
involvement with some really active NFL

286
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,340
players in the space and some of our new

287
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:17,049
investors are musicians so yeah so we're

288
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,730
gonna be doing some launch parties and

289
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:20,949
some stuff with them and hopefully using

290
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,920
their Instagram and social medias to

291
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,350
really push the product yeah exactly

292
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,819
yeah they're all I hear a lot of they

293
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,610
are and some of them have been in it for

294
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:34,660
a minute I mean the NFL players are very

295
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:37,440
much involved I mean were ya know I did

296
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:43,529
an event where I had kissed em Osgood

297
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:48,820
who was a wide receiver it was basically

298
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:51,129
opiates cannabis and like sports leagues

299
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:55,720
so I had my friend Kenny Florian who was

300
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:57,610
in the MMA talk about like what him and

301
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,470
all the other MMA fighters went through

302
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,210
with like being handed pills and stuff

303
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,639
and then kasym was the same thing with

304
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,769
NFL where like the doctor is just there

305
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,960
like here's the bottle of pills slap on

306
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:13,539
the ass like go home when you're like

307
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:18,879
addicted like Brett Favre and the fact

308
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:21,459
that you can't smoke weed the hypocrisy

309
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:25,000
of that you're basically creating

310
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:27,639
addicts it's like sanctioned high level

311
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,710
addiction like people who will need the

312
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,750
most pain meds during their career and

313
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,460
then those things are super addictive

314
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,879
and this is where tincture because you

315
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,470
can't viably say to someone that smoking

316
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,509
is healthy and do it for wellness

317
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,000
because you know it's smoking its

318
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:45,309
carcinogenic so what I would that's

319
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,460
where I'm very passionate maybe you

320
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:50,859
disagree I do okay yeah all right so

321
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:55,000
there was this guy Donald tashkin or is

322
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,190
he's a pulmonary expert at UCLA and he

323
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,639
was fun his research was funded by NIDA

324
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:03,980
which was basically NIDA is UCLA

325
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,289
but night as sole mission is to prove

326
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,830
that like drought-like drugs in this

327
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:11,659
case cannabis are bad okay and his

328
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,290
research proved the opposite and this

329
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:18,529
study was basically people who smoke

330
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:20,329
joints regularly and his control group

331
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:24,439
was people who smoked three joints a day

332
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:25,910
which is like a lot of weed carcinogens

333
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,730
like these aren't people who smoke like

334
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:32,059
one joint or one Bowl hitted right so

335
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:34,310
that's his study group and then what he

336
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:36,799
concluded was that statistically those

337
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:40,369
people have less likelihood of getting

338
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,429
lung cancer than someone like who smokes

339
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:46,159
nothing

340
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:48,649
cigarettes cannabis so whatever is bad

341
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,589
and carcinogenic is you know in the wall

342
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:54,169
that is offset by the soul there's a net

343
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,300
positive interesting and it came out

344
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:59,240
UCLA I'm yeah I'm inclined to believe it

345
00:14:56,299 --> 00:15:03,769
all right all right I'm gonna go back to

346
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,330
smoking no I think that's that's one

347
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,519
part of it but like what I found with

348
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:10,129
the tinctures is that it's just more

349
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:19,189
efficient like we're smoking right now

350
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:22,820
15 grams of hash no we're good it's like

351
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:26,570
hash gluttony it's roughly 10,000

352
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:31,460
milligrams of kind of fatty pork and

353
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:34,040
drinking exactly teachers get to you

354
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,769
quick though it's just more visual yeah

355
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,809
I are tinctures are bioavailable because

356
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,699
of the MCT and stuff in about 20 minutes

357
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:43,189
so you feel it in about 20 minutes

358
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,390
especially if you put it sublingual I

359
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,880
definitely want to start experimenting

360
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:48,769
with teachers okay great yeah well get

361
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,809
you some all right so you're giving

362
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:53,319
props to the 7:10 guys and I totally

363
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:57,229
forget what you were saying about them

364
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:59,720
so because you so this is an example of

365
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,759
someone you respect so they're not only

366
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,590
doing they're not doing ice water hash

367
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,409
from my level on a cure level they're

368
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:08,420
only doing live ice water hash so it's

369
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:10,339
not directly competing with my company

370
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:13,669
at the moment but at some point I will

371
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,940
be doing what they're doing and and I

372
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:15,620
just

373
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,540
I disrespect what they're doing it's

374
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,299
inspired me my hat's off to them

375
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:22,250
I hope they welcome me in the market who

376
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:25,250
are the guys there who are focused on

377
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,110
the solvent list their main team is out

378
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,549
of Colorado I do not know them there

379
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,860
right now training their team up in

380
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:33,139
Oakland but the Oakland team apparently

381
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,240
it's creating really good stuff already

382
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:36,740
so yeah I just I'm more familiar with

383
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,620
their products and not their management

384
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,470
but um but I but they're coming yeah

385
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,139
they're they're doing amazing work yeah

386
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,779
that's why I think it'd be cool to go be

387
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:48,860
like hey hey - I'll come apprentice with

388
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:53,149
you for a couple months

389
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:56,120
yeah yeah his facilities in Oakland it's

390
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:57,529
always that I he's in Maywood I didn't

391
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,000
even solve unless steps out of me would

392
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:02,419
seem him better for him does he live

393
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,860
down here yeah yeah yeah I've always a

394
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:05,839
lot of respect for burner and everything

395
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:09,860
he's done I met him you know I think

396
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,509
twice cookies is a great example of

397
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,729
someone understanding what was going on

398
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:16,940
way before everybody else and executing

399
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,819
on it impeccably my hat off to him a

400
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:22,000
hundred percent when I head off for

401
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:25,519
hiring the do to run the solve unless

402
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,680
that was a good choice yeah you know it

403
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,329
takes passion making hash is passion

404
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,330
it's art so you have to have passion

405
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:39,139
okay I love that I'm gonna go pick Jim

406
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:41,509
up and like 45 minutes an hour your

407
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:46,220
daughter yeah her preschools literally

408
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:48,589
my works it's a lot of hard work to do

409
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,779
it because I mean if you do it I like to

410
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:52,639
do it by hand you know washing my hands

411
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,319
Wow you know that's the best way you

412
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,330
argued the best quality I feel like it

413
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,339
isn't you know but thinking a scale you

414
00:17:56,329 --> 00:18:01,609
know hard people have these avanti

415
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:03,199
washers you know so once you would like

416
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:05,209
to try one of those to compare it how

417
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,610
big are those I think they make a few

418
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,990
different sizes but like I would you

419
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:11,240
know make a few different size it's a 3

420
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,829
cubic foot I seen as one of them before

421
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,750
I've gallons yeah

422
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:16,250
something I've seen them pretty big too

423
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,680
I'd never had one in person up you know

424
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,759
yeah but I see them being used a lot of

425
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,759
washing up

426
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:27,470
currently we're using bolt bag washers

427
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:29,440
20-gallon washers nothing special I use

428
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,630
a twenty gallon bags as well yeah bags

429
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,580
we use just we basically set up our

430
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,470
whole lab get twelve of them but they're

431
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:38,899
all done in tandem so there's six

432
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,819
stations yeah and we think we've done it

433
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,320
so one person can run six days oh that's

434
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:45,259
awesome man I would love to see that

435
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,669
scale yeah that's crazy some photos

436
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:48,950
we're sending it all up right now so

437
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:50,509
it's an app we started this company in

438
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,150
California City but we learned really

439
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:55,460
quickly was that California cities in

440
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,590
the middle of nowhere and no one wants

441
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,910
to work there so like even I didn't want

442
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:02,089
to work there so like we couldn't find

443
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:05,660
anyone to run that literally so that's

444
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:07,639
funny right now we're downtown is that

445
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:12,970
literally in the desert you know

446
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:14,480
Palmdale well I went to the Mojave yeah

447
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,190
yeah

448
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,819
like the town of Mojave in the desert

449
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:23,120
like it's like it's 30 more miles like

450
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:25,279
up in the desert like a copy see no it's

451
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,229
I think it's a population of 10,000 and

452
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,269
you know this is hopefully not offending

453
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,099
people from there but I mean it's

454
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:33,019
literally like it's the only thing going

455
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:35,629
on there is meth and you know I think

456
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:37,400
it's where like I think the Crips or

457
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,920
something and they hide people you know

458
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:48,710
it's like we're gangs people so yeah

459
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:50,600
it's the local police force I met them

460
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:57,769
it's one guy that you could pay off

461
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:59,329
really easily I'm sure in math but it's

462
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:02,509
trying hard I mean you know they're

463
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:04,519
really build our environment - yeah most

464
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,740
importantly for us we need a controlled

465
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,889
environment and and fighting that

466
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,650
fighting that that dry heat was terrible

467
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:17,830
yeah if you're gonna see like hash labs

468
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:17,830
popping up in deserts ya know

469
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:24,620
the drier environments in terms of types

470
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,210
of hash it's it's better for life like

471
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:29,509
you're dabbing hashes it's better for

472
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:33,110
life so like four hours for crumbles

473
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:34,009
four other oils and so forth it's you're

474
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:36,169
trying to pull out

475
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:37,910
all that moisture but with a traditional

476
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,110
hash while you are trying to pull out

477
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,529
moisture you're not trying to like

478
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:45,649
completely decimate it of all you know

479
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:50,180
you it's like like a good flower do you

480
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:52,310
want your flower to be dust no think

481
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,779
about this all the hash traditionally in

482
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:57,259
the world where was it made rif

483
00:20:53,779 --> 00:21:00,500
mountains Lebanese mountains Nepalese

484
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:02,750
mountains Afghanistan mountains shit's

485
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,369
always grown in the mountains and it

486
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,500
partly and made in the mountains and

487
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:08,569
partly it's because weed grows better at

488
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,460
altitude you get much better weed

489
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:13,220
growing at three four thousand feet from

490
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,529
from from surface from from sea level

491
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,180
but the other side of it is when you

492
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:18,920
have humidity in the air you're allowed

493
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:21,259
to retain more humidity in the tricone

494
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,690
they don't dry out as fast and that's

495
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:25,700
our game like my game making traditional

496
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,750
house because you want to cure the game

497
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,670
is trying to cure it

498
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,049
but not too much so the whole game is

499
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,330
trying to get it right at that perfect

500
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:33,919
moment and that's the art form if you

501
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:36,829
can get to get it there what is a

502
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:40,250
perfect cure for me usually it's five

503
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:42,859
days after it's been harvested trimming

504
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,359
around that time and then giving given I

505
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:48,049
have that materials right that in there

506
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:50,479
yeah not long because like if I get a

507
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:51,710
product that isn't supremely oxidized

508
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,279
when it's come out you'll naturally

509
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,809
oxidize it in the pressing process yeah

510
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,160
but I do have clients or does Adam in

511
00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:02,079
that they want their stuff to be black

512
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,080
you know and if it's a little brown

513
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,309
there's a market for that yeah so they

514
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:08,930
want it fully oxidized because you know

515
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:10,339
the blackness or the brown is like he

516
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,980
was saying earlier it has nothing to do

517
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:15,139
with the strain or any of that very much

518
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,880
very little has entirely to do with

519
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,250
trichome size and then oxidation

520
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,730
oxidization but so what are what do they

521
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:25,009
like with something that's oxidized that

522
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:31,250
much I think because it's traditional

523
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:33,319
and there's more CBN in it yeah yeah so

524
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:37,250
that's like anymore how she proved for

525
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:41,089
150 yeah it's also like yeah wines great

526
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:44,900
but like do you remember do you remember

527
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:47,329
cannabis oils from like early 2000s and

528
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,840
before there weren't a lot of like color

529
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:50,149
can of

530
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:53,168
oils a lot of a lot of the lighter color

531
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:56,000
was a real marketing ploy you know and

532
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:59,960
it's just it's an it's an older trichome

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,880
for the most part and you know if they

534
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,250
created this thing where people just

535
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,840
naturally believed like when I say

536
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,548
people I'm usually the market at large

537
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,230
younger demographic know the market at

538
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:10,490
large there's definitely a concept

539
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,798
especially in America

540
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,589
absolutely that any product that is not

541
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,658
oxidized is better and that's kind of

542
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:20,538
part of what we're trying to dispel the

543
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:22,100
reality is not that the reality is even

544
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:24,470
in some cases they're harvesting the

545
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:26,089
plants prematurely so the trichomes not

546
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,690
even oxidizing the plan at all I mean

547
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:31,879
forget milky everything and then you're

548
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,409
getting something that that doesn't have

549
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,090
any of the cannabinoids you want it will

550
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:36,409
give you some really pretty high that's

551
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:38,089
like right in the head and they kind of

552
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:40,460
give me a headache and yeah I mean you

553
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:42,798
want CBG I'm happy cuz we wanted to

554
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,409
develop because most of you can always

555
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:47,210
start a CBG and you want them to develop

556
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:49,970
into their constituents I mean you want

557
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:52,308
it to be th CV you want it to be THC you

558
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:54,589
want it to be CBD you want it to be CBN

559
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:56,750
and it doesn't get to have that it

560
00:23:54,589 --> 00:24:01,849
doesn't get there without oxidization

561
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:03,679
the products are high CBG they are okay

562
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:06,619
and high and that's giving you the code

563
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,390
flaw or the very and yes that's not good

564
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:10,699
sorry that's the app that's giving you

565
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,590
like a cerebral it's almost like a ton

566
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,360
of caffeine or something in a way but

567
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:14,898
it's more like it's me I don't like it

568
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,178
at all

569
00:24:14,898 --> 00:24:18,918
personally I mean I have CBD isolates

570
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:20,538
you want to try it yeah it gives you

571
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:24,440
like a rush right in the head I don't

572
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:31,519
like it you guys would though you want

573
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:33,909
to try try this terrible thing like no

574
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,908
I'm good

575
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:39,980
but again like I'm just scratching the

576
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,750
surface as we all are I mean even

577
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,720
Frenchie would admit you know we all are

578
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,250
and now we're able to apply real science

579
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,230
spectrometers and things like that

580
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,148
that's something that I'm so excited and

581
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,278
they and then and really do testing you

582
00:24:50,148 --> 00:24:54,048
know in blind studies and really figure

583
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:55,970
out what each kind of morning is doing

584
00:24:54,048 --> 00:24:57,500
if there's upwards of a hundred unique

585
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,179
molecules and cannabis called

586
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,700
cannabinoids well we need to figure out

587
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:03,610
which each one is doing

588
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,680
how many cannaboids are there is plus

589
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:07,929
100 plus and yeah what do you what they

590
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,100
do that's the effective embody I read

591
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,600
about one that I've never heard about

592
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:12,189
recently that they're studying in some

593
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,649
university where they actually put it

594
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,090
directly on a cancer cell and they saw

595
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,730
some you know a negative effect to the

596
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:20,829
cancer cells so yeah there's been

597
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:23,529
anecdotal entity evidence for a long to

598
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:26,019
the THC variant it was but it was one I

599
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:28,899
had never heard of it was like THC v6 to

600
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:35,099
I have a friend who did cancer research

601
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:37,750
at UCLA and it was stem cell cancer and

602
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:39,490
basically that they they looked at all

603
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,119
you know you do your testing through a

604
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:46,750
library of 30-plus thousand chemicals

605
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:48,609
and of those 30-plus thousand like the

606
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,130
couple that showed promise one was

607
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:52,179
cannabis and he wanted to do more

608
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,720
research because they were using

609
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:57,820
synthetic cannabis and it had bad side

610
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,160
effects and he was like if I could just

611
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:02,200
get my hands on the real thing was you'd

612
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,840
eliminate the bad side effects but keep

613
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:09,730
the benefit in using sativex

614
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:11,139
or Marinol it's either of those two it

615
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:15,069
wouldn't have been anything else we can

616
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:16,720
get him on speakerphone right now yeah

617
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:18,460
and that's another thing you just kind

618
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,559
of segue into which is the full spectrum

619
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,090
entourage effective very important you

620
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,859
know yes and we're full believers in

621
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:26,169
that in the hash world and in my

622
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:28,299
tincture products you know we advocate

623
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,500
for everyone to be true believers in the

624
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:31,569
full spectrum because that's what you

625
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,190
lose with the isolate and that's what

626
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:35,139
you know a lot of people don't realize

627
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,820
what's going on with like the CBD I

628
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,380
systems are going around in all those

629
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:40,029
isolates and they don't most we don't

630
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,970
even realize that most CBD product they

631
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:45,460
get is hemp derived and more often not

632
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,680
not even Hampton the state most of those

633
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,470
hemp products that are even being grown

634
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,080
not a BCC farm so they're not going

635
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,870
through the same strict testing that the

636
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,829
real cannabis industry is going through

637
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:58,899
you know so it's a completely even

638
00:26:56,829 --> 00:27:00,129
ballpark and then not only that but most

639
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,550
of these people aren't being told

640
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:05,830
anything

641
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:07,210
okay so they think an isolated and

642
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:09,699
they're in a lot of these people too

643
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,049
that take a CBD some of them they're

644
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,420
afraid of getting stoned but they don't

645
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:16,180
realize that if they take a ratio that

646
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,070
outweighs the psychoactive the THC yeah

647
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,840
what the CBD they're not gonna get

648
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,799
stoned they you know but they're still

649
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,750
gonna be able to benefit from that

650
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,659
entourage effect you need the uncharged

651
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:29,769
effects so what are your thoughts as you

652
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:32,110
look at solvent extraction like all the

653
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:33,160
trends and innovations like one of the

654
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:36,969
things we're just talking about was like

655
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:39,519
making product clearer right yeah I mean

656
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,829
III internally there's something that I

657
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,920
just don't like about taking something

658
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:47,679
that is crude and full of carbon and

659
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:50,560
dirty and made in a violent manner and

660
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,960
then ultra processing it and a

661
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,789
purification procedure to make it look

662
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,319
something that it's not you're not

663
00:27:54,789 --> 00:28:01,359
selling I'm not passionate I have no

664
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:04,779
opinion about this whatsoever but yeah I

665
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:07,149
mean I really think that the entire you

666
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:08,920
know solvent world is just selling

667
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,900
something I personally never consumed

668
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,490
never would would consume and I've never

669
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,620
sold it I have not I've been in this

670
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:17,049
industry in 15 plus years I've never

671
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:20,099
sold a solvent product he used to sell

672
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:22,419
them for me but technically it wasn't me

673
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:26,199
no I don't believe you just throw you

674
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,940
under the bus no he doesn't either in a

675
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,890
big way I mean we we did our things back

676
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,200
in the day to make money but the reality

677
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,330
is I truly don't I don't

678
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,299
I've never consumed wax in any of its

679
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:40,240
forms I never would it doesn't taste

680
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:42,279
good it's made really in a bad way it's

681
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,720
always dirty there's always stuff in

682
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:48,430
there and back of your head like you

683
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,870
just know like okay and then when I did

684
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,950
the molecule thing looking under the

685
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:55,389
microscope that's what brought it home

686
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,220
total II different yeah it does not look

687
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,780
like a trike or my hat on my plan I want

688
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,360
to believe it all right yeah a lot

689
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:03,819
people that like they want that just

690
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:07,959
quickly before I forget for the pin the

691
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:12,250
whole panel here you get none one or two

692
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,990
thumbs up for the quasar starting all

693
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:21,069
the way down on the left

694
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:23,589
thumbs up okay fucking two thumbs Hey

695
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:25,299
oh and he's up his mr. negative so he'll

696
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:31,359
tell you right away if he doesn't think

697
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:34,089
something's nice yeah I mean it's nice

698
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,490
well honestly one thumb all right new it

699
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:38,189
no I mean it takes too much there's it's

700
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:41,740
not practical for the average person

701
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,509
it's a sesh device you know and to be

702
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,210
fair I don't think we got it going in

703
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:48,190
its best

704
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:50,650
yeah good I think you got to get more

705
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,570
charcoal on top yeah and and for your

706
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,460
average consumer not only not practical

707
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:56,799
because the amount but your average

708
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,799
consumer I mean like when we have stuff

709
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,339
in store for you only have grams in

710
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:07,539
store cuz that's that's a market that's

711
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:10,269
not really yeah and even even if that

712
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:11,799
dispensary were to start taking off you

713
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:13,690
know their margin for them it's still

714
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:18,159
not in order to great for it go well

715
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:20,860
have this as your sesh device for those

716
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:24,190
rare for your like smoking community

717
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:27,159
with a totally like it knowing that

718
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:31,600
scenario gets you from Cali I was like

719
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:34,150
an everyday yes yeah you hit on that for

720
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:39,159
what Frenchie does with it for Cali

721
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:41,710
house purposes 100% a tool but it's a

722
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,808
party tool it's 20 people you literally

723
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:46,420
need cuz I'm even I'm even overwhelmed

724
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:48,490
on my lungs are closing up you need like

725
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,470
20 people to enjoy it properly which is

726
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,480
what friend she does so tastes good

727
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,819
though yeah once it gets going nice is

728
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,400
nice I mean compared to this this guy

729
00:30:54,819 --> 00:31:01,689
you get a two thumbs it also needs a

730
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,710
little more coal than normally I mean

731
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,808
it's the first time we're using this

732
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,130
thing like normally with the tobacco and

733
00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:08,529
to be clear he wouldn't give two thumbs

734
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:12,070
up to anything in his life so like you

735
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:14,710
know it's pretty much good I think it's

736
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:16,928
great yeah you definitely needed

737
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:22,150
multiple people you can't be doing this

738
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:24,000
virus I mean in case you could like

739
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,640
maybe so anxious you gotta help out

740
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,289
maybe someone just plugs it like

741
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,330
some money flew in from downstairs I

742
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:31,889
can't walk down the street with it well

743
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:33,509
I guess I could see someone plug in it

744
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,130
once a month or something at their house

745
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:36,930
I mean that just smokes hash and every

746
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:41,220
time they come home and they just put a

747
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:43,259
few coals on and get her going again all

748
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:52,019
day Sunday yeah you can easily stop

749
00:31:43,259 --> 00:32:00,240
watching football matches and this is an

750
00:31:52,019 --> 00:32:04,349
airtight as well I don't know I can

751
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,170
safely say I'm stolen now guys I think

752
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:11,969
so what I don't even remember who I was

753
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:14,310
talking to but it was like doing this

754
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:21,600
and having to work all the cameras and

755
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:28,259
like set everything up you're not

756
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:29,789
working like watching you on Monday

757
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:31,109
night I was like how's he doing it cuz

758
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:34,889
yeah yeah they really beyond a point

759
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:36,929
there okay and then I get super high any

760
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:40,920
time I ever do it so I'd like to hand

761
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:43,110
it's like a to what he's like I make

762
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,600
hash but with two hands behind my back

763
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:50,219
cuz he does oh he has a partner right

764
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:53,039
what he does the dry and wood trim yeah

765
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:56,150
so you want using flour currently he can

766
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,069
get his hand right of the trim for R&amp;D

767
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,230
but everyone else was like and the

768
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:03,000
shitty mix is still amazing so like the

769
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:07,380
fact that he's making another just trim

770
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,619
yeah more respect right for sure I mean

771
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,030
I I get some pretty decent trim and I do

772
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:13,289
have people are taking out the fan

773
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:14,399
leaves so you got people that are being

774
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:15,659
a little cheap audio and throw out a

775
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,160
bunch of families in there I just

776
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,340
watched some families that was holding

777
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,870
on to and yield it pretty good if you're

778
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:25,349
honest man as like two pounds of

779
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:26,849
families but you'll did okay but I don't

780
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:30,839
know that's my beats in the freezer if

781
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:32,519

782
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,230

00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,559
artisanal craft doing

832
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:44,420
craft beers taking a big chunk out of

833
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:52,940
market for sure it should be about then

834
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:54,500
you find out that like I'm a free market

835
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,380
person if someone wants to capitulate

836
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:15,469
and you know so they're brand you know

837
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:21,140
retire or maybe start a new brand why

838
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:23,179
are you talking to the give that thing a

839
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:25,639
world they're like two to five million

840
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:27,710
dollar you know markets and stuff like

841
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:30,559
that it's just too small for them to

842
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:32,179
throw their R&amp;D on so they go to the

843
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,400
craft fairs and they're like we love

844
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:37,099
your product we see it on the shelves

845
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,599
and that you know small geo-located area

846
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:41,059
and it's like instead of having our own

847
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:42,739
in-house Rd working on a chocolate or

848
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:46,809
whatever we're just gonna buy this

849
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:46,809
company of this company of this company

850
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:52,389
is an interesting model on their part

851
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,030
like why but the thing is though too is

852
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:58,039
you know in some sense if you have good

853
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,740
management you can somewhat throw money

854
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:02,239
at things but throwing money at things

855
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:05,269
doesn't always work so a lot of these

856
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,469
brands that get taken over on one hand I

857
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:08,420
think a lot of them are gonna fail out

858
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:10,339
but on the other hand it's like do they

859
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,780
really care but they fail out they're

860
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,910
just gonna buy another portfolio of

861
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,380
brands you mean the people who bought it

862
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:17,659
I think the people who started roaring

863
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,280
or like that's someone that built it

864
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:19,759
they know how to build you killed my

865
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:29,210
baby

866
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:31,640
yeah back back to the radio mic like a

867
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:33,230
yahoo buying a tumbler and it's

868
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:35,059
basically like we're just buying them

869
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,630
for the software development challenge

870
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:40,960
yeah don't really care about

871
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:44,200
I think there's less of that with

872
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,369
consumer product you know because to

873
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:46,689
them as long as they're meeting their

874
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:48,759
bottom line and they're taking that

875
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:54,820
brand because to them brand means more

876
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:56,620
than quality a lot of the times so I

877
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,930
don't think it really necessarily works

878
00:37:56,619 --> 00:38:01,329
that anything to a craft is like a lot

879
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:04,509
of craft people tend to want to pay

880
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:06,279
attention to the sourcing of the product

881
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:08,200
and so I feel like some of them they

882
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,660
find out so-and-so got bought out by

883
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:26,889
so-and-so it turns them off a little bit

884
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:35,949
of that product really what kind of what

885
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:40,779
what flavors of the yogurt also drives a

886
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:44,559
big seller sour cherry came mulberry a

887
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:46,690
walnut honey than their seasonal flavors

888
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,940
so the seasonal flavor right now it's

889
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:52,630
summer peach which is harvest over the

890
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:55,900
summer quince is coming out in about a

891
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:58,420
month we just actually turned thousand

892
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:02,170
plus pounds and to preserve so that will

893
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:07,070
go out and in a few weeks

894
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:10,219
there's their savory yogurt so shallot

895
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,219
[Music]

896
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:25,329
Oh so my question before was something

897
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:28,329
like this

898
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:30,819
can you like does it keep it all or yeah

899
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:32,380
yeah if you take the heat off I feel

900
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,030
like three days from now I could light

901
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,340
that bad yeah yeah that's what I was

902
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:39,850
saying you could totally just sit on it

903
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:43,090
now yeah with like a rosin product yeah

904
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:44,469
but granted the cool off period that

905
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:47,200
you're not smoking when it is cooling

906
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:48,459
off you will be wasting a little bit cuz

907
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,349
you're not smoking and some of it has to

908
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,970
burn away to cool off but other than

909
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:54,069
that you could totally just chill on it

910
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:56,019
you know come back to it when you want

911
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,460
to come back to it even like I would

912
00:39:56,019 --> 00:40:00,969
even mix it up a little bit before you

913
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,289
go back at it right yeah yeah I mean I

914
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:03,459
guess your kid is great since you can

915
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:05,949
come back to and chill on you don't

916
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,360
necessarily have to have 20 people so so

917
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:09,730
that coals are still going right yeah

918
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,590
they're in there yeah is this meant for

919
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,809
you can use and we're just using if they

920
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,750
either dying down it works Ferb

921
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:18,730
yeah I've seen paddle tobacco's like the

922
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:22,349
only time yeah for traditional like all

923
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:25,179
their marketing videos traditional yeah

924
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:29,230
oh just works great for what we wanted

925
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:31,269
for yeah so in the average one this is

926
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,159
the normal go ahead is that clay thing

927
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:37,210
yeah like I see people trying to torch

928
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:39,819
the glass yeah I think this is the yeah

929
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:44,050
this is the second generation okay you

930
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:49,900
could you just know someone would try to

931
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:51,519
yeah I'm sure but I'm also sure they

932
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,740
have they probably have a design patent

933
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:56,170
okay job they have a mechanical patent

934
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:58,719
around it that's that's the idea yeah if

935
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,760
you could heat it from below just with a

936
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:03,039
padded email sort of the situation you

937
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,830
plug just get the bottom stuff yeah and

938
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:08,349
then it would just be get bigger hits

939
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:09,909
yeah yeah cuz right now the problem

940
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:11,860
that's happening is you're just it's

941
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:14,230
hard to get the heat going through all

942
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,789
of the hash cuz you're just getting the

943
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:19,389
top cuz you're the only way that he gets

944
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:24,659
there is by sucking so this is work to

945
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:28,368
work a lot we're lazy this set of time

946
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:31,048
we're too lucky email though

947
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:33,450
good too much work

948
00:41:31,048 --> 00:41:36,210
no though actually an e-version of this

949
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:39,480
is would be very smart well that's what

950
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:42,690
I'm talking I'm assuming yeah you are

951
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,880
talking to them no I I'm I want to

952
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:48,380
design one yeah you should yeah and can

953
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,030
do your own brand yeah genius too fast

954
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:55,170
all you have to do is use a normal coil

955
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:56,849
but do it at the diameter right I mean

956
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:58,680
you can then it be hyper portable

957
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:01,440
practical like people like think of

958
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:04,108
people like okay like charkh like coal

959
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,450
which like drops on the floor and sets

960
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:08,039
my house on fire and to be honest what

961
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:10,019
you would want to do is you'd want to

962
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:13,079
make it so it's one of those motor

963
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:14,639
Universal hookups it's like a it's like

964
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:18,269
a camera type hookup I thought that I

965
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,769
forgot the name but Pelican nails come

966
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:22,469
with it a lot of those big nails coming

967
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:25,889
with it so that way yeah sure you could

968
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:27,689
do your box and sell that too but if you

969
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:29,759
make it more Universal and people

970
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:33,240
already own that and buy your product

971
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,640
yeah yeah no I I hate when companies do

972
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:38,459
stuff where it's like super proprietary

973
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:40,798
right so even you know I when i go into

974
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,409
dispensaries I talked to the bud tenders

975
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:44,730
about like the pods because you have

976
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:46,889
different look but here's the thing

977
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:49,349
about the pods versus the pods can only

978
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:52,949
for the most part use something that's

979
00:42:49,349 --> 00:43:09,210
very liquidy so the super high quality

980
00:42:52,949 --> 00:43:11,308
oils yeah that's the standard thread

981
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,809
yeah yeah but the thing about these

982
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:14,400
these are actually better than the pods

983
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:17,849
because you can get a thicker liquid in

984
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:22,289
there and not only that can't sleep

985
00:43:17,849 --> 00:43:24,510
estimate for price so the benefit is to

986
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:27,599
make you buy their stuff because people

987
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:32,220
are inherently I don't want to say cheap

988
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,960
but frugal right and so they if someone

989
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:35,848
already gets sold by about tender on a

990
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,300
battery and they go to a dispensary and

991
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:40,510
they say I have this battery

992
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:42,670
I need I need a cartridge they're gonna

993
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,810
be like oh here you go and if they go

994
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,130
well what about these and they're

995
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:48,159
talking about the seven tens and the

996
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,480
five tens then it's like oh no those

997
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,710
won't fit your battery you got to buy

998
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,059
new batteries well how much is a new

999
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,909
battery and then all of a sudden they're

1000
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:56,980
buying this person's it's all about

1001
00:43:54,909 --> 00:43:59,139
cornering your customer and forcing the

1002
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,050
like in their opinion you know that's

1003
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:03,159
what it's about that's at least my

1004
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:06,090
perspective and the outside looking in

1005
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:08,619
on that's what I think they're thinking

1006
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:10,960
they want to force the situation they

1007
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:15,009
totally do but but they're selling

1008
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,110
likening it's not I thought the whole

1009
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,480
reason for pry up because of my head I'm

1010
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:21,910
like who would ever be like we'd love

1011
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,940
for you to controller proprietary pod

1012
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:26,440
and for us to be on it versus like why

1013
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,079
would we want that when we can just stay

1014
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:31,090
on the open source so originally they

1015
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:32,710
tried to do a proprietary thing pax was

1016
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:34,420
trying to do it first and they tried

1017
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:37,119
doing exclusives with companies that

1018
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:39,130
didn't work out because all they really

1019
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,500
had was design time it was a Chinese

1020
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:43,119
product and there are other pod

1021
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,159
companies that were there are also

1022
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,929
cartridge manufacturers that were making

1023
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:48,639
variants of it and then it came out into

1024
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:51,549
the market and that's why eventually you

1025
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:53,230
saw no real exclusivity in terms of

1026
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,930
brand you started seeing people had

1027
00:44:53,230 --> 00:45:02,650
nothing to do with pax at all you know

1028
00:44:55,929 --> 00:45:05,169
like what's their names dizzy right but

1029
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:07,360
so now you have to but I don't think

1030
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:10,570
it's true but it's not truly proprietary

1031
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,550
it's it's reprise to the point of most

1032
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:14,590
other companies aren't doing it and you

1033
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:17,620
know this and so you're setting up a

1034
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:19,960
situation where well I guess dizzy pod

1035
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:21,549
won't fit in a pack correct correct

1036
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,079
yeah but you're setting up is right so

1037
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:26,530
you're setting up a situation where you

1038
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:29,199
already owned the battery so now you're

1039
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:31,390
you're you're in the crossroads of do i

1040
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,789
buy another battery to get something

1041
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:38,589
else if i really want on yeah right

1042
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:40,599
pretty yeah yeah I thought it was based

1043
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:41,420
on the fact that those bonds are better

1044
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:43,670
than

1045
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,079
eze we're saying they're not and then

1046
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:49,670
it's kind of like why the hell would

1047
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:50,090
anyone never know I mean I'm sure I'm

1048
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:54,860
sure

1049
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:57,470
like I'm sure somebody could get the

1050
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:59,410
manufacturer to customize this a little

1051
00:45:57,469 --> 00:46:03,230
more to what you can customize these two

1052
00:45:59,409 --> 00:46:10,099
but they've gone so far in terms of how

1053
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:12,260
to customize these because if you pay

1054
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:16,699
attention to like how the so what's in

1055
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:22,810
here is that this is a robbery so

1056
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:22,809
they're like oh I see you do hit solvent

1057
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:32,360
of solvent Lissa's yeah products you

1058
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:37,400
know you're not as know but I use this

1059
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:38,750
for when prices that I can't really it's

1060
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,000
not something I smoke every day like

1061
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:44,869

1062
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:48,530
right some people but you might like

1063

00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:04,670
the sauce and cannabis terminals and

1066
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:16,159

1067
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:18,200

00:49:58,978 --> 00:50:03,899
percent of the general market pre-rolls

1132
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:07,858
or 35 percent and growing exponentially

1133
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:09,179
is insane on a month look at VDS

1134
00:50:07,858 --> 00:50:10,168
analytics so tell you everything you

1135
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:12,568
need to know about what the markets

1136
00:50:10,168 --> 00:50:14,308
doing so you know we're very excited to

1137
00:50:12,568 --> 00:50:16,380
take Kelly Ashe to those markets because

1138
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:17,189
the hope that's right you're adding

1139
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,278
pre-rolls

1140
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:23,518
which is a super I gotta go so the whole

1141
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:25,048
idea was to go into a low competitive I

1142
00:50:23,518 --> 00:50:27,088
mean living the passions that I have for

1143
00:50:25,048 --> 00:50:29,458
making hash you know the financial

1144
00:50:27,088 --> 00:50:32,578
economic side for me was always strategy

1145
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:34,348
and there was very low competition I had

1146
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:37,289
one competitor in NASA because Frenchy

1147
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:38,969
wasn't even in the market and so I said

1148
00:50:37,289 --> 00:50:40,890
fuck I've always been doing her so why

1149
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:42,869
wouldn't I just and that's how I've

1150
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:44,879
wedged my foot in the door I'm now in 55

1151
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:46,108
retailers done that very easily I've

1152
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,759
just signed with three large

1153
00:50:46,108 --> 00:50:50,219
distributors that are completely

1154
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:53,548
statewide and they're gonna put us in

1155
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:54,778
the last 350 that we're not in so you

1156
00:50:53,548 --> 00:50:56,639
know and we've done it with very little

1157
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:57,298
resistance because it's only national

1158
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,578
and they have a very limited

1159
00:50:57,298 --> 00:51:01,259
distribution and there's not many other

1160
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:02,849
people out there doing this level of

1161
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:05,338
hash you know it's like at that price

1162
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:06,749
point in everything so um so that was a

1163
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:09,900
whole ideas get your foot in the door

1164
00:51:06,748 --> 00:51:11,848
that way and then off the back of that

1165
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,130
you launch other brands and once you

1166
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:16,709
have a brand that people like other

1167
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:18,568
brands or other other categories other

1168
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:21,239
categories when I say mature would be a

1169
00:51:18,568 --> 00:51:24,958
product exactly and it's its pre-roll

1170
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:27,059
and it is full spectrum hash make sure

1171
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:29,998
that one's actually a different brand

1172
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:31,890
but but that's the only one the rosin

1173
00:51:29,998 --> 00:51:34,139
the premium and the pre-rolls will all

1174
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:36,538
be Cali ash products and all our current

1175
00:51:34,139 --> 00:51:38,158
retailers and the ones coming will all

1176
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:41,459
take it so that's you know that was that

1177
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:43,890
was the business strategy behind it if

1178
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:45,778
you will and that's how I convinced

1179
00:51:43,889 --> 00:51:47,998
everybody involved to this point you

1180
00:51:45,778 --> 00:51:49,978
mentioned 710 but who else do you

1181
00:51:47,998 --> 00:51:52,889
respect and it doesn't just have to be

1182
00:51:49,978 --> 00:51:54,389
hash like who else was my yeah well for

1183
00:51:52,889 --> 00:51:58,558
any mark absolutely good question I mean

1184
00:51:54,389 --> 00:52:02,400
a legal market a legal market alien labs

1185
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,870
a lien labs my hat off to them I know

1186
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,240
them

1187
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:06,949
they're really amazing people beard

1188
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:11,839
brothers farms has done an amazing job

1189
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:13,699
in the legal space yeah yeah I'm like

1190
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:17,180
you guys doesn't even begin to cover it

1191
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:19,399
like and they're really to the roots I

1192
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:20,929
mean there are true true true industry

1193
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,760
people yeah exactly

1194
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:25,609
they've been in this the game forever in

1195
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:27,500
California and their their advocacy is

1196
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:30,470
what I'm most impressed with their they

1197
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,389
truly do push the mark and and and and

1198
00:52:30,469 --> 00:52:34,069
everybody here that everybody industry

1199
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:36,469
uses them so to get the real information

1200
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:40,039
and and not only that their product is

1201
00:52:36,469 --> 00:52:44,539
good as well so them try men's game

1202

sure bin skis is always you know good

1206
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:58,940
yeah the legal markets interesting no

1207
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:01,400
Wonder Bread obviously I think yeah I've

1208
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,710
seen some good genetics from a called

1209
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,660
Kings farm I ran across them like a

1210
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:08,360
month ago they're out of the desert

1211
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:10,339
flower company I have some really good

1212
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,780
cuts I'm never getting some I have been

1213
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:14,690
a dispensary a long time but like he's

1214
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,310
to go to strain and get like and faith

1215
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:19,130
for the names but like Hydra boys they

1216
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:20,329
had some stuff you know I concentrate

1217
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,430
they had actually the person I had like

1218
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:23,779
the sauce

1219
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:25,909
like they have this one cut called a

1220
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,680
seeded grapes that's really good you

1221
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:32,269
keep talking about yeah it's like

1222
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:47,269
amazing and it's it's acidic yeah and

1223
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:50,210
they're really on point was it you smart

1224
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:53,030
flour oh yeah yeah and do you prefer

1225
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:56,389
indoor or outdoor indoor okay he's a

1226
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:58,370
love 11 I love outdoor lab we know but I

1227
00:53:56,389 --> 00:54:00,440
mean I like I like I like indoor like

1228
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:04,309
profile 3d robotics up so that's still

1229
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:05,809
natural stuff yeah but I mean I know I

1230
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:08,289
also personally know people that do

1231
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,289
really good

1232
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:14,829
but the reason I prefer indoor is you

1233
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:19,139
can just control it better you're at the

1234
00:54:14,829 --> 00:54:19,139
women nature and an outdoor you know

1235
00:54:20,849 --> 00:54:26,769
yeah drink wine this but here's the

1236
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,440
thing you know what that interesting

1237
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:32,860
expression actually really is more so

1238
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:35,470
than the outdoor environment giving it

1239
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:37,660
that most outdoor growers they're

1240
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:39,789
growing by seed everything most of them

1241
00:54:37,659 --> 00:54:42,129
aren't doing it by club and so a lot of

1242
00:54:39,789 --> 00:54:44,590
them are getting slight variance of

1243
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:47,289
Aries strange it's like one of the

1244
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:50,620
biggest things that people misconstrue

1245
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:52,750
with with cannabis is the difference

1246
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:54,400
between strain and phenotype they think

1247
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,809
just because something has the genetics

1248
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,099
that it's going to taste like that it's

1249
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:59,110
going to smell like that it's gonna look

1250
00:54:57,099 --> 00:55:00,699
like that but the easiest way for people

1251
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:02,860
that don't understand that your swing

1252
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:05,439
phenotype to understand things is you

1253
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:07,840
have a child is your child 100% exactly

1254
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,909
like you know your child's of bearing if

1255
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,590
your child might be better than you your

1256
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:13,149
child might be worse than you your child

1257
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:14,620
might be slightly different than you but

1258
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:17,559
almost the same as you but it's never

1259
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:21,670
gonna be hundred-percent you to be you

1260
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:24,130
I got a clone you know so that's really

1261
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:25,570
a lot of the same that's a lot of the

1262
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:28,869
variance that you're seeing with outdoor

1263
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:31,350
which is I like and it's attractive but

1264
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:35,199
I just overall prefer indoor cannabis

1265
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:37,420
yeah and you well you don't really smoke

1266
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:40,179
flower I do I do i still enjoy like

1267
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:42,400
joint with friends no I'll smoke with

1268
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:44,919
him actually guys what I consider

1269
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,110
outdoor I consider a real greenhouse

1270
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,789
indoor though okay but if I'm in NorCal

1271
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:51,309
which I spent like the first five years

1272
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:54,039
of my career in California I was living

1273
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:55,779
in Healdsburg and I preferred the

1274
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:58,809
outdoor you know the fresh good

1275
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:00,460
greenhouse and does there's something to

1276
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:03,190
be said for the full spectrum of the Sun

1277
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:06,400
you know and and even the high HPS is

1278
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:08,260
and even your best dual traditional

1279
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,990
ballast system does not get the full

1280
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:13,330
spectrum but some greenhouses it's like

1281
00:56:10,989 --> 00:56:15,819
there's such a huge variance in

1282
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:17,409
greenhouse quality like it's like some

1283
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,170
greenhouse you're pretty much outdoor

1284
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:22,690
it's not really a like

1285
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:29,318
a structured building per se it's like

1286
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:31,539
barely that the PVC pipes with the -

1287
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:33,210
yeah it's that that's why I like and

1288
00:56:31,539 --> 00:56:36,969
then there you have your greenhouse a

1289
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:38,740
real foundation it's essentially like

1290
00:56:36,969 --> 00:56:41,828
it's essentially an indoor building

1291
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:45,279
except for the fact that it has a glass

1292
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:47,980
or plastic roof and that is it so I

1293
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,540
consider that really pretty much indoor

1294
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:52,838
you know I know there's argument to that

1295
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:54,279
whatever that's semantics but at the end

1296
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:55,900
of the day I prefer something that's

1297
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,109
within a controlled environment or

1298
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:01,030
something that's just for you and I

1299
00:56:58,108 --> 00:57:03,460
still gotta pick my daughter up all

1300
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:03,849
right now we have to rather yeah all

1301
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:08,159
right

1302
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:08,160
strong work team thank you guys
