1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,388
Nik I wanted to have you do a SAP

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:11,699
analysis just like monologue

3
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,699
you know we're essentially just looking

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,829
at what's ending up inside of the plant

5
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:19,669
we're looking at what the mineral

6
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:23,250
nutrient you know micro metal comp

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:26,039
composition of cytosol and cytoplasm

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,920
inside of the plant actually is which

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,689
gives us another window into what's

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,300
going on as we try to balance our

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,808
microbes and as we balance our minerals

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:39,959
in the soil what's ending up in the

13
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:41,878
plant and so with the leaf extract

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:48,590
analysis is actually with the lab that I

15
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:51,058
use which is apical here in Oregon they

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:54,510
you know they're looking at old and new

17
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:57,570
leaves so what is concentrating in the

18
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:59,189
old leaves and what is making what

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,829
nutrients are making their way to the

20
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:05,069
new leaves and sort of you know what's

21
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,319
what's going into that along with that

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:11,429
what are the surpluses of nutrients in

23
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:13,679
the plant is their storage of calcium in

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,780
an old leaf that can make its way to a

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:22,140
new leaf is there an excess of chloride

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,030
that's locked up in the old leaf and not

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,109
actually making its way efficiently to

28
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,478
the new leaf so you know if you have you

29
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:33,030
know a thousand parts-per-million of

30
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,009
chloride in an old leaf and the new leaf

31
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,960
has only taken maybe a hundred and

32
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,728
eighty of that that plant is telling you

33
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,389
that it is trying to shed chloride

34
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:44,578
because there's too much of it in that

35
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,009
so really it's just giving us another

36
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,679
window into what's going on with plant

37
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,899
nutrition which ties in to plant health

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,899
that ties in to what's going on with the

39
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,790
protein what's going to be going on with

40
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,070
flowering as we move through that cycle

41
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,460
you know as we are talking about

42
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:04,648
cannabis on a cannabis show here and you

43
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,029
know what the susceptibility to pests

44
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,368
and disease is really going to be and

45
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,640
it's it's taught me some interesting

46
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:13,229
things I've worked mostly I've worked in

47
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,569
soil that is

48
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:18,989
less than ideal in terms of the mineral

49
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:22,500
profile and so I see a lot of high

50
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:25,920
sodium in cannabis and that's a whole

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,219
other story why that happens but it's

52
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,739
common and I expected to see very very

53
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:34,379
high sodium inside of the plant as a

54
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,350
result because you know it's a single

55
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,269
charge and it's not very tightly bonded

56
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:40,799
and so I moves around readily you know

57
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,510
you can flush it out I would think what

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,910
they can't plant would just take it up

59
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:45,389
very efficiently but that's not what I

60
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,849
see

61
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:51,479
it doesn't actually end up inside the

62
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:56,609
plant and most places in most cases in

63
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:58,409
talks at toxic levels and I think it's

64
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,720
the biology that's actually doing that

65
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,750
that or the plant is actually what they

66
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,359
would call sodium exclusive and so it

67
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,580
actually takes up the chloride side of

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,150
the sodium chloride instead of the

69
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,550
sodium if it is sodium exclusive that is

70
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,319
a very energy expensive process so just

71
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,160
because it's not ending up in the plant

72
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,169
doesn't mean that it isn't sucking

73
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,609
energy and you know nutrition and

74
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,069
enzymes and everything else from the

75
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,230
plant in it to enable for the plant to

76
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:31,979
enable itself to actually exclude that

77
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:35,729
sodium so along with being able to see

78
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:37,289
what the profile is in the plant you

79
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:40,349
know we can also make some of these

80
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:44,340
other correlations with what cannabis

81
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:46,919
actually prefers for example you know K

82
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,979
gets up in there no problem I don't find

83
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,780
myself having to to really supplement

84
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,280
with K at all as long as there's a

85
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,400
decent amount in the soil because it

86
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,489
moves so readily the lab that I work

87
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,959
with is the numbers that we see there

88
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,789
are a lot higher than what you're going

89
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,180
to see on a normal tissue test because

90
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:09,269
they're able to extract the SAP the

91
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,810
cytosol and the cytoplasm from the leaf

92
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:15,900
without crushing and extracting any of

93
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,389
the vascular tissue in that leaf I don't

94
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,370
know exactly what this process is what

95
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:23,219
the leaf looks the same after they pull

96
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,800
the fluid out of it and so you see parts

97
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,090
per million up into you know with K

98
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,310
sometimes

99
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:31,709
seven eight thousand I've seen 12

100
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:36,060
thousand in a plant that was looking

101
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:40,189
fine you know we we also learn about you

102
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:43,470
know what certain strains are actually

103
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:45,569
you know taking up and concentrating

104
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,030
inside of their SAP versus other strains

105
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:51,149
so it's just it's another dimension it

106
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:53,099
really is and the reason we're so

107
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,779
interested in this is because you know

108
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,340
we want to know you know what nutrient

109
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,189
cycling looks like from the plants

110
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,409
perspective but secondly we don't want

111
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:02,339
to be spraying integrated pest

112
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,950
management

113
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,759
you know pesticides insecticides these

114
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,189
kinds of things

115
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,230
we want to tackle the nutrition we want

116
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:12,000
to get to the root of the cause we want

117
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,129
to treat you know even if you do call it

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,139
a band-aid to apply a full year

119
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,689
application of a targeted mineral that's

120
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,409
been identified as deficient through

121
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:25,019
testing that's what we do because it's a

122
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,730
lot better than being on a program where

123
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:28,889
you're just constantly on you know

124
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,230
you're on a spray routine where it's

125
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,719
three different insecticides you know

126
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,770
every two weeks or whatever regardless

127
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,150
of if they are organic or not and then

128
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:43,519
the other thing is you know what are

129
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:46,079
those sprays doing to the you know the

130
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,750
mineral composition inside of the plant

131
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,129
and that's been interesting too so

132
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,509
there's been plenty of cases where we've

133
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:53,069
been doing that kind of testing and

134
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:56,099
there have been sprays occurring and

135
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:58,019
that is essentially clouding some of the

136
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,870
results so you know we go back to the

137
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:04,379
ingredients and look and see what's

138
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,000
actually making up that spray and what

139
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,500
are some of the inactive ingredients and

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,160
that spray and then we can make some

141
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,579
further conclusions about maybe why

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,439
we're seeing what we're seeing but being

143
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:20,159
able to see the difference between the

144
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:23,579
old and the new leaf lets us be ahead of

145
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,330
deficiencies by you know maybe a week

146
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:29,399
maybe two it's really hard to say but

147
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:32,969
you know it's been valuable for us we've

148
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:35,009
learned a lot from it for sure and we'll

149
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,780
continue to use it into the future to

150
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:38,728
make some targeted applications to try

151
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:39,729
to bolster plant nutrition instead of

152
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:41,740
falling back on

153
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:46,180
insecticides fungicides those kinds of

154
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,980
things even if they are again yeah how

155
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,259
much have you done on like have you done

156
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:55,240
much of that on indoor SAP analysis on

157
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:56,980
indoor I have yeah and cuz sometimes

158
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,329
it's like those systems are driven a

159
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,420
little harder with the lights and

160
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:03,939
everything and yeah yeah it's it's

161
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,759
interesting you know I've really seen

162
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:09,009
things all over the map I've seen indoor

163
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,529
gardens with functioning biology that

164
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:13,959
have parts per million of soluble salts

165
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:17,709
of where 2,000 parts per million you

166
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:20,109
know which is not something that you

167
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:22,029
would expect to see with a you know a

168
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,750
fairly well-functioning

169
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:27,429
food web right so this is why we look at

170
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,899
all this data right we're trying to

171
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,319
learn about this stuff and manage it as

172
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:34,839
best we can we're trying to avoid you

173
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,969
know the kill it mentality we're trying

174
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,189
to make it healthier instead of killing

175
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,400
off whatever it is that's attacking that

176
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:44,050
plant because that's not the real issue

177
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:46,509
the real issue is there's some kind of a

178
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,579
deficiency with the physiology of that

179
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:51,250
plant and usually you know how does it

180
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:56,310
deal with nutrition and obviously the

181
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:59,079
biology or you know microbes or what are

182
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,639
enzymatically catalyzing that nutrition

183
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,240
and the root zone to be up taken by the

184
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,479
plant

185
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,920
yeah but I think when you get into

186
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,000
genetics and all that kind of stuff

187
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:13,080
whether it's a a wild genetic or a newer

188
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,360
hybrid regardless of what the crop is

189
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,609
you're gonna see differences there as

190
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,420
well in terms of how the plant can fend

191
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:24,340
for itself in a biological soil you know

192
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,350
what what kinds of transport protein

193
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:28,089
says that plant actually been bred to

194
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,520
produce you know is it going to be able

195
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:33,549
to pull that calcium in in the way that

196
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:35,649
it needs to and so of course there are

197
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,889
new anomalies that have come about from

198
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:42,309
using SAP analysis but we invite them

199
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:44,379
you know but that's that's what we're

200
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:46,619
all about we're you know we're trying to

201
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:48,789
find answers we're trying to identify

202
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,759
the root cause of a lot of these

203
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:53,289
physiological issues that we see

204
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,059
regardless of what the profits

205
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:57,879
yeah not have to reach for that

206
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:59,769
pesticide yeah I appreciate how

207
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,159
seriously Nick is taking a

208
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,389
sustainability you know part of

209
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,429
maintaining the regenerative movement is

210
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:10,269
having farms that are a shining example

211
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:12,250
of financial success and you know having

212
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,110
their products move in the market and so

213
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,019
I'm not saying that the only way to

214
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,430
ensure success is by doing a lot of data

215
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:22,929
points but you know I feel that that's

216
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:24,489
one of the things that the organic

217
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:27,399
sector really needs more of

218
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,080
we need more measurement of something to

219
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,029
guide these farmers to know when it's

220
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,009
going wrong you know one of the really

221
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,659
heavy aspects of our job is we get

222
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,759
people that call us at the end of the

223
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:40,389
road you know we get a lot of last

224
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:42,039
chance you know farmer on the suicide

225
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:46,779
watch type phone calls and so we're

226
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:48,849
really in in tune to you know some of

227
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:51,730
the problems with popular trends and and

228
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,350
and the inability to measure those in an

229
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:58,360
effective way that leads to a successful

230
00:09:53,350 --> 00:10:00,820
outcome you know and and you know it's

231
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,950
tough sometimes it's it's tough it's

232
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,190
tough when some of the loudest voices

233
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,259
are constantly speaking against

234
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,290
scientific quantification of the process

235
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:12,759
which can ensure your success and I just

236
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:15,789
like what I would like to see more

237
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:18,429
organic farms adopt reasonable levels of

238
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:20,759
quantification of their process at least

239
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:23,319
in the beginning to help you determine

240
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:26,379
where you're going and where you're at

241
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,440
and possibly what some roadblocks might

242
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:32,080
be ahead you know it seems like any

243
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,870
organic farmer that's done this more

244
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,950
than several years has a story of one

245
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,810
year where everything went terrible and

246
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,300
you know the more we do mineral analysis

247
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:45,189
the more we do biological analysis the

248
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:47,979
easier it is to see those indicators

249
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,570
coming so that we can redirect around a

250
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,690
major obstacle that will take another

251
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:54,700
farm out because the number of

252
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,710
hydroponic farms is still increasing

253
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,600
everyday the number of people that

254
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,460
believe Rock will is still the strategy

255
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,070
for cannabis is still the way they're

256
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,009
getting funding you know and one of the

257
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,810
ways that organic commercial facilities

258
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:11,460
can maintain

259
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:14,519
their funding is by meeting meeting the

260
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,830
business world with a reasonable level

261
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,289
of quantification to show why you do

262
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,480
things we see a lot of farms don't get

263
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:23,870
supported or don't get chosen because

264
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,370
the cultivators don't appropriately

265
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,320
quantify how you're going to protect the

266
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,149
investment or how you're gonna protect

267
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,339
this operation in general whether it's

268
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:35,009
mom-and-pop investment or you get some

269
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,720
long or whatever you might be partnering

270
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:39,600
with some big business I don't know but

271
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,290
nonetheless some quantification of the

272
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,670
process needs to be done in order to

273
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:49,019
have a different level of validity in

274
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:51,299
the market you know they're just there

275
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:53,990
just needs to be a little bit more

276
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:56,669
accountability of process in my opinion

277
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:59,519
the small farmers don't get a little bit

278
00:11:56,669 --> 00:12:01,289
more data-driven in some cases in order

279
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,169
to work smarter not harder than

280
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:06,088
understanding the aspect of all these

281
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:08,399
bugs and things you know yeah spraying

282
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:09,900
the pesticides is what agriculture wants

283
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,269
to do but also understanding the

284
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:14,370
nutrition of the plant and so that it

285
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,139
can resist these bugs all together and

286
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,029
going back to you know everybody looking

287
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:20,639
at strain-specific they're these certain

288
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,649
strains or you know turf profiles

289
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,600
attract more bugs but it's a lot of

290
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:28,409
times what we're seeing as the plants

291
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,200
take up nutrients and and and process

292
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:33,389
things differently by different strain

293
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,030
which in turn we're growing all these

294
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:38,720
same or different strains in one

295
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,399
greenhouse or one grow room or one field

296
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,920
trying to operate it all the same same

297
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,230
drip feeding food we're definitely gonna

298
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:49,429
see inconsistencies and outbreaks and

299
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:53,159
certain things that are consistent with

300
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:57,269
you know plant health basically I agree

301
00:12:53,159 --> 00:13:00,689
with yes God Nick I the the

302
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:03,149
quantification is huge and it gives you

303
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,430
even if it's not the whole answer it

304
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,350
gives you points on the board where you

305
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:09,088
like you all of a sudden you kind of

306
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,300
brush up against it you're like oh right

307
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:15,360
this is going on and it helps give a

308
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:17,969
fuller picture of the laws of nature how

309
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,200
we're partnering with nature and Nick

310
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:25,019
I'm wondering are you gonna

311
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:28,780
produce a PDF or some sort of

312
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:32,919
publication on your findings with with

313
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:34,929
all your the sap analysis and then one

314
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,539
more one more thing before you because

315
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:41,019
because well maybe we'll all like twist

316
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:43,329
your arm on that one by that I think

317
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:46,059
what you're doing with a the connection

318
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,940
of the the analysis of the microbial

319
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:51,549
population in conjunction with the

320
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:56,380
nutrient analysis in the SAP is so vital

321
00:13:51,549 --> 00:14:00,479
so much of the kind of agricultural data

322
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:03,840
we have you know on nutrient uptake on

323
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,940
what nutrients you need based on soil

324
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,490
nutrient deficiencies was created in

325
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,850
these scenarios where they would never

326
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,860
actually looked at in the ten farms they

327
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,379
did which farm had microbial life

328
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:22,090
present which was totally torched dirt

329
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:24,100
and that that lack of accounting for the

330
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,100
variable I think has really hurt our

331
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,090
understanding of how nutrients are taken

332
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:35,740
up and so I think looking at you know

333
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:38,950
mere merit marrying the the SAP analysis

334
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,930
with the microbial life profile in the

335
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,680
soil that they're growing then I think

336
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:47,589
is vital for us to actually understand

337
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:49,299
the the ways plant take up plants take

338
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,030
up nutrient and the deficiencies they

339
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:54,669
show up going forward because it's we

340
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:57,250
don't live in a vacuum I think so too

341
00:14:54,669 --> 00:15:00,269
and I've proposed this idea to others

342
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:04,029
you know including Elaine just as

343
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:06,309
another again tool but also just like

344
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:10,000
piece of data to look at all these

345
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:12,189
things right it didn't you know it's

346
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,720
sort of fell on deaf ears at that time

347
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,320
but that doesn't mean that it won't come

348
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,910
around with respect to publishing

349
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,560
something I probably need to get a

350
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:23,559
little more serious about the importance

351
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,989
of that right now even doing this kind

352
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:29,559
of thing yeah I don't do much of this at

353
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:31,360
all I'm mostly you know working with

354
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:33,669
farmers trying to solve their problems

355
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,220
not right now but you

356
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:39,909
usually on site with farmers and that's

357
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:43,120
that's where I want to be for sure but I

358
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:45,490
do see that there is a need for this

359
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,799
kind of data and I would encourage

360
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,720
everybody to check out there's some

361
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:51,669
different labs across the nation - not

362
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,480
all of them will take samples from

363
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:57,879
Canada from cannabis apical AG here in

364
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,250
Oregon we'll take some samples but he

365
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,200
won't take them through the mail so

366
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,789
that's that's been really tough because

367
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,650
people can't send it in from other

368
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:12,189
states they basically got to drop it off

369
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:13,870
in person so I you know I do I try to

370
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,640
take in some of those samples as a

371
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,320
courier for some of those clients of

372
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,169
mine that are having bigger problems for

373
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:25,210
sure and try to prioritize that kind of

374
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:28,689
thing but even if we call it half right

375
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:31,840
exactly I've sorted I've tried to cross

376
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:34,570
that he said no on hemp - I don't know I

377
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,610
don't know this this may change sooner

378
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,750
than later and it's not that he's anti

379
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,899
or anything like that he's just

380
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,039
concerned about taking that stuff

381
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,379
through the mail because I don't think

382
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:48,990
that yeah he's just trying to play it

383
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:51,580
safe that's all but we certainly see

384
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,710
correlations to the things that we read

385
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,930
in the academic publications with

386
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:59,980
respect to pests and disease and the

387
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:04,500
profiles inside of the plant whether it

388
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:08,170
be a deficiency malnutrition if you will

389
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,939
or an excess of something like nitrate

390
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,130
which is I think just a really common

391
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:14,319
one that everybody points to those are

392
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:18,640
the situations in which we see pests and

393
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:20,588
disease pop up you know we've been able

394
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,110
to deal with a lot of different pests

395
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:25,088
just from a biological standpoint well

396
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:27,458
you know you guys talked about cannabis

397
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:29,919
aphid recently on one of these episodes

398
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:33,850
and that's a new one that everybody's

399
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:36,460
dealing with and it's it's a it's a

400
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:40,209
beast for sure it rates a reproduction

401
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:42,250
for that thing are pretty wild but you

402
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,600
know I feel like we're we've really got

403
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,759
a handle on that one

404
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,579
specifically through a couple of

405
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,460
different modes

406
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:50,929
but you know this has helped immensely

407
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,289
with looking at the composition of

408
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:57,440
what's inside of the plant and trying to

409
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:59,000
respond to that with by you know not

410
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,640
applying anything that's already in

411
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,339
excess or in surplus but trying to get

412
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,190
some of what's deficient into that plant

413
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:10,819
and in some cases like what the chloride

414
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:13,279
that I brought up we're learning stuff

415
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:15,740
about you know carbon in the plant which

416
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,569
I talked about having by a lot biology

417
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,849
in the soil and not hindering the uptake

418
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:24,169
is some of the sodium but having carbon

419
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:27,859
in the plant seems to mitigate some of

420
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:30,830
the uptake and regulation of the uptake

421
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:33,969
of chloride if you that's a really

422
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:33,970
common law okay

423
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:40,220
sodium not so much but the chloride side

424
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,920
of that molecule that comes in the table

425
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:47,509
salt if you will that one makes it up in

426
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:49,820
there know the problem yeah it's just

427
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:51,799
we're learning a lot there's a lot left

428
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:53,629
to learn for sure I don't think that I

429
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:57,710
have big enough datasets right now to

430
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,750
really put forth a PDF but we will we

431
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,309
will eventually and you know we're

432
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,569
starting to work into some other crops

433
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:05,179
now with this happen

434
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:08,210
SAP analysis or leaf extract analysis

435
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:11,299
and so I'm excited for what we're gonna

436
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,559
find with respect to wine grapes which

437
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:14,960
is something we're going to be moving

438
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,960
into here in the next couple of weeks

439
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,509
and through this season you know what

440
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:25,460
kind of a benefit can we have for that

441
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:29,150
type of the crop so David is really the

442
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:31,640
person who runs the owns and runs a flag

443
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,320
that could really elucidate more of

444
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,930
what's going on behind the scenes and

445
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:38,599
these findings that he's sort of

446
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:40,549
gathered over five years so it's finally

447
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,349
been long enough that you know he's got

448
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,789
some pretty significant data sets and I

449
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:46,819
would say he's going to be the one

450
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:50,899
that's going to be putting forth you

451
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:52,970
know PDFs or maybe something in preprint

452
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,380
maybe he'll work with a PhD on something

453
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:58,160
in that and they'll get something into

454
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,750
the archive for sure but we're just

455
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,470
starting to talk about

456
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:05,089
trying to work the microbial data into

457
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,130
that as well because I think it's

458
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:10,549
important you know we need to paint as

459
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,020
big a picture as we can and you know

460
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:14,389
he's done some work with a lien in the

461
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:17,059
past and so he's on board for sure but

462
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:20,330
he's a small business as well just like

463
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:21,019
me and he's always flying by the seat of

464
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:24,230
his pants

465
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,910
so getting publications that out there

466
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:28,160
that kind of thing to mean these kinds

467
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,840
of appearances I mean who knows maybe he

468
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,840
would even be interested in being on the

469
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,730
show and just talking more about you

470
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:36,379
know what he's learned in the course of

471
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,140
five years with working with this stuff

472
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:42,320
you can check out some of the videos of

473
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,120
his on YouTube his apical AG channel and

474
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,609
I think that really helps put things

475
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,779
into perspective when I first started

476
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:50,659
working with him he didn't really have

477
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:53,899
general levels for cannabis but now he

478
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:57,019
does which has been really nice so I can

479
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,480
kind of see an instance originally what

480
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:02,089
it was was we were basically looking at

481
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,579
the concentrations of any given mineral

482
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:07,639
or nutrient the gradient if you will

483
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:09,529
between the old and the new leaf and you

484
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,320
know if something was three hundred

485
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:14,119
percent in the old leaf than it was in

486
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,889
the new leaf like I mentioned before I

487
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:18,559
mean that's a toxicity the plant doesn't

488
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,870
want that but it's there you know it's

489
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:25,759
being uptake in any way and it's causing

490
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:27,829
some major problems so he yeah he's

491
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,900
really the guy to sort of to talk to

492
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,789
about you know what he's learned and

493
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,670
he's taught me a whole bunch with

494
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:36,589
respect to how to acknowledge or to

495
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,720
respond you know what are the action

496
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:43,639
items that come from seeing that

497
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:46,910
something is deficient and in a surplus

498
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,210
or actually at levels that are toxic for

499
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:53,210
the plant so that has sent me down a

500
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:56,900
whole other rabbit hole if you will of

501
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:58,400
trying to learn plant physiology from

502
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,070
the standpoint of you know what's going

503
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,570
on inside of the plant and what are

504
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,069
these mechanisms inside of the plant you

505
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:05,869
know what are the transport proteins

506
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:07,819
what are the different organs what's you

507
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:10,219
know what level of diffusion or active

508
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:13,069
transport is involved with this one and

509
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,139
okay yeah going back to what Eric said

510
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:18,379
is going to be variation from crop to

511
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:20,689
crop and from strain to strain if you

512
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,610
will from you know between genetics in

513
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,490
terms of what the nutrient use

514
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:28,959
efficiency is going to be or this strain

515
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:32,259
or that crop verse another one so I

516
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,579
think it's a great tool it's inexpensive

517
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:37,339
you know if you're in Oregon or growing

518
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:40,668
something other than cannabis send David

519
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:42,109
a sample and just start to look over

520
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:44,600
that and see what you can learn about

521
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:46,729
your own crop because those targeted

522
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,109
applications are really what it's all

523
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,849
about that's what we're trying to do we

524
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:51,519
don't want to apply anything that's you

525
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:53,959
know that we don't need to be applying

526
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:57,429
we just want to sort of fill in the gaps

527
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:01,340
and again it's a band-aid for sure and

528
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:03,528
with cannabis it's been a very valuable

529
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:05,449
tool because of what we talked about

530
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:07,339
before being in these very unnatural

531
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,069
environments where we don't have a

532
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:12,319
season of rest a season to gather energy

533
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:15,230
in the soil in some cases like in these

534
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,908
greenhouse settings it's just go go go

535
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,528
you know clients that are twenty thirty

536
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:24,409
rounds in on soil and that you know

537
00:23:20,528 --> 00:23:26,990
three four crops a year that's that can

538
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:29,059
be a challenge but you know we slowly

539
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,750
gather this data and look at all these

540
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:34,940
points and we respond and we go with

541
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,619
what works and we go with what moves the

542
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,120
needle in terms of the data in the

543
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:40,939
direction that we're trying to go and

544
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,829
that's been immensely helpful where you

545
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,639
know I've cannabis clients as well that

546
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:47,990
are right in native soil and it's more

547
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:49,459
like clockwork in terms of this

548
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,829
regenerative process that we're all

549
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,389
talking about we can inoculate in the

550
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:55,278
fall we can get some of those minerals

551
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:57,079
down in the fall we use cover crop we

552
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,298
inoculate that cover crop scene with the

553
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:02,418
microbes we want to proliferate in that

554
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:05,359
soil over the you know fall and winter

555
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:08,059
and early spring and barely have to use

556
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,339
inputs whatsoever and you know grow a

557
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:12,589
great cannabis crop right in native soil

558
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:16,278
I think the appellations of origin thing

559
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:19,898
that we were talking about via email the

560
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:22,730
other day a little bit that's going to

561
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:24,619
proliferate you know the number of

562
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,789
operations that are willing to plant

563
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:28,619
cannabis in the native soil which is

564
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:34,440
what they should be doing if they can't

565
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:38,309
as for sure this stuff goes a little

566
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,590
more by the book when you when you're

567
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:42,240
working with nature and it's a little

568
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:44,699
bit more complex when you're in an

569
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,190
indoor setting or four-season greenhouse

570
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,860
setting and I don't even sit clients to

571
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:52,350
Eric because you know he's really the

572
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:56,039
guy to talk to in terms of what the

573
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:58,139
environment and what the the appliances

574
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:59,940
and the levels of this and that and the

575
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,220
atmosphere really need to look like and

576
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,640
how do you smooth out this seasonal

577
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,110
shift you know I think he talks about

578
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,509
the summer in the winter mode in

579
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:11,759
greenhouses and most people aren't they

580
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:13,740
aren't ready for it when winter hits and

581
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,650
then you know you see a drastic drop in

582
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,029
production and new problems arise and

583
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:21,690
all kinds of stuff like that

584
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:23,549
and so you know it's more complex and we

585
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:26,070
need all kinds of people on that experts

586
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:27,720
to really help on that front you know if

587
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:30,319
we're going to continue to do this thing

588
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,319
you're out
