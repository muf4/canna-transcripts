we have yeah i uh i was talking

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,720
my wife is a little uh disenfranchised

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,079
with our gardening this year because

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,920
typical uh farmer you know push

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,679
push that envelope how soon can i get

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,039
the plants in the ground and we had so

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,479
many starts that i was like i'm gonna

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,759
risk it with these and

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:46,878
we got a late frost and things died so

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:49,759
she's bummed but we got

19
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,479
lots of starts to go in so it'll be fine

20
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,000
yeah

21
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:56,159
did you lose your pumpkins my giant

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,679
thousand pound pumpkins i lost all but

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,759
one um

24
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,280
so i'm gonna have to reseed those yeah i

25
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,839
was kind of bummed

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,079
that's that's my first time ever uh

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,560
messing with a uh award-winning uh

28
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,879
pumpkin seed figured it'd be a fun thing

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,079
if we had to forklift a pumpkin out of

30
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,959
here

31
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,280
you have one it might be the one it

32
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,399
might be the one yeah it survived

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,320
in spite of things hey

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,840
tina if you give me just a second i'm

35
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,839
gonna get just a little bit of

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,400
firewood to start the fire

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,799
that's amazing you go for it i'll be

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,799
right back

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,400
okay i'm so excited

40
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:40,319
[Music]

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,399
so who's going to bite who's going to

42
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,239
boise this this summer man

43
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,079
we got it we got to get there and spend

44
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,599
some time together and inoculate our

45
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,959
bodies with all the

46
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:55,519
antivirals we're going to need for

47
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:58,399
changing our changing our uh

48
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,399
changing our world

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,519
be covering how and why to use it yeah i

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,879
mean i could start

51
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,200
i could start a little bit i mean

52
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,959
potassium has an interesting place in a

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,719
plant world and

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,159
the reason i think sunflowers are so

55
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,280
cool is because think about it they're

56
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,199
growing in the desert

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
like they did they come up they're hardy

58
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,479
they come up

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,760
before the frost they're one of the

60
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,199
first presenters

61
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,280
and they uh they thrive in any

62
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,318
environment including drought

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,280
and one of the one of the qualities of

64
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,679
potassium

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,719
is that it's uh it boosts the metabolism

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,519
of the plant

67
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,318
it's a protein synthesis kind of thing

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,640
uh it's

69
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,479
the water maintenance the water balance

70
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,279
in the plant it's the one thing that's

71
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,679
present

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,039
in the stomata of the plant that opens

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,599
up during the day

74
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,159
so it kind of has this opera so it's

75
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,639
like

76
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,560
it does that action the more the plant

77
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,679
can open up and receive

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,878
um what it needs to the more vigorous

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,080
that plant is going to grow and the

80
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,039
bigger it's going to produce

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,840
and all that so it's a drought tolerance

82
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,840
it's a pest and

83
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
disease

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,800
you're like hearing it loud and clear

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,800
hold on i'll turn it off

86
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,919
i i kind of like it there you go there

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
you go

88
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:35,359
there we go there we go there we go

89
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,360
um yeah and potassium deficiencies don't

90
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,840
really affect the root mass they

91
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,560
sort of affect above ground so it really

92
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,519
it really is kind of

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,439
a major um component when it comes to

94
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,759
how the plan is going to do

95
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,719
in a season especially with drought and

96
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,079
we're going to be

97
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,759
you know in colorado we're seeing a lot

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,519
of extremes in weather and the

99
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,158
sunflowers are always they just so

100
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,759
resilient

101
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,438
kind of doing potassium's

102
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,280
and uh i've been playing a lot with

103
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,479
boron and potassium and boron work

104
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,640
hand-in-hand

105
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,639
do kind of the same processes

106
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,318
there's a week-long hint of intensive

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,079
that chris puts on in boise yes there is

108
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,759
and i'm telling you i practiced kind of

109
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,000
well i didn't practice knife i thought i

110
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,079
was just thinking

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,079
[Music]

112
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,319
uh for a good year before i went to

113
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,400
chris's class and there is nothing like

114
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,519
a hands-on class to teach you what you

115
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,799
need to know about

116
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,839
so many of these little

117
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,520
details that can't be

118
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,198
okay they have to be shown you have to

119
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,198
taste it smell it see it

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,960
and then you know it and then your body

121
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,040
knows it and

122
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,758
and then you get to go home and practice

123
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:50,479
it your nose doesn't forget

124
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:53,840
nose does not forget oh it's so true

125
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:57,199
um let's see what else oh

126
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,359
the chart i might i'm gonna

127
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,120
i'm gonna ask if no i'm not gonna ask a

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,080
chose slappable question i'll ask it a

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,639
different way

130
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,198
i'm very curious about the biochar

131
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,560
aspect of the wsk

132
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,319
because i've been chris i've been

133
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,600
extracting it using it as a

134
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,199
mineral and that's not knf so i'm very

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,639
curious because biochar is fascinating

136
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,079
me right now i'm using it a lot of my

137
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,918
soil mix

138
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,079
i got as i sort of was listening to

139
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:26,000
master cho's videos and put together

140
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:29,359
soil mix that he he suggested and i'm

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,800
in love with it my i transplanted all my

142
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,000
houseplants

143
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,240
and like they're so happy and they like

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,800
look at them they're like crazy happy

145
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
that one's not

146
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:49,038
all right well i uh

147
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,519
now i feel like i wanna so typical

148
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,079
hawaii you know fashion born raised in

149
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,359
hawaii

150
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:57,279
or back and forth some to california but

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,280
we're slow motion you know the the

152
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,879
process is you know everybody comes over

153
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,559
for dinner and they they get involved in

154
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,120
the cooking process and everything where

155
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,639
it's like

156
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,800
moved to the mainland and everybody's

157
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,478
like oh if i invite you over for dinner

158
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,120
when you walk in the door

159
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,038
we're sitting down to eat so different

160
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,079
culturally from uh

161
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:18,399
so uh i apologize so uh

162
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,318
for for starting the fire now but here

163
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,839
we go we got the fire going

164
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,319
um i'm going to talk a little bit about

165
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,719
what you need to uh to do this does that

166
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,160
make sense

167
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,360
all right so today we're going to use

168
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,600
a dutch oven

169
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
it's a simple tool for making small

170
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,240
batch biochar

171
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:44,399
um just really really useful so in here

172
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:49,519
i have some pre pre-charred um

173
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:52,079
sunflower you know the head the stock

174
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,399
etc we'll go a little bit longer on this

175
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,279
i pre-chart it so take a very short time

176
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,758
to kind of

177
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:02,959
finish up and then we'll start some um

178
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:07,439
sesame stock you know just to show

179
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,079
kind of how to use that material as well

180
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,439
so this is

181
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:14,639
a black sesame stock full of potassium

182
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,639
you can also use

183
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,719
asparagus if you're asparagus grower um

184
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,280
especially

185
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,720
uh if you don't want to like take away

186
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,758
from your produce

187
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
um so you don't want to take your your

188
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,919
wonderful asparagus heads that you're

189
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,919
gonna take to market those big um

190
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:37,759
photosynthesizing um kind of vegetative

191
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,879
heads that you let the asparagus grow

192
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,800
so in asparagus farming you are are

193
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,399
letting some of the asparagus kind of go

194
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
to seed go to flower

195
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,839
so that it's photosynthesizing and

196
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,840
bringing energy down into that plant you

197
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,038
don't want to harvest a hundred percent

198
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,038
because you you'll lose long term you'll

199
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,318
lose production in that asparagus patch

200
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,279
so you let some of them go

201
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,479
and get really big those big heads full

202
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,198
of seeds and

203
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,639
and leaves etc are perfect for making

204
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,919
biochar especially at the end of the

205
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,199
season when they've done their job

206
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,159
they're starting to harden off

207
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,319
or dry out taking all of those and

208
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,680
making your wsk with that is a great

209
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,280
material

210
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,879
sunflower so sunflower asparagus these

211
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,279
concepts aren't really

212
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,400
isn't something i was taught by master

213
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,399
cho or learned in korea

214
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,719
but it is in line with the natural

215
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,198
farming

216
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,639
concepts in that he said you got to

217
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
figure out what works

218
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,080
this is how it works in korea you got to

219
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,120
figure out how it works

220
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,240
mainland usa or in hawaii so what what

221
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,360
i've done with that

222
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,399
um if you want a little bit of

223
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,080
kind of the contents of potassium ppm

224
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,120
you can go over to

225
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,560
other videos frozen

226
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,879
not me not

227
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,679
uh it may be for them as long as you can

228
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,439
see me then

229
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:05,199
we got we got a live feed um

230
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,839
so not a lot of people grow sesame in uh

231
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,040
in the u.s um it's just not something

232
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,399
super common

233
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,599
and because of that we didn't have

234
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,879
access to this

235
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,440
part of the ingredient list but if you

236
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,080
go

237
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
over to aquaponic growers i think it's a

238
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,360
facebook group

239
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,639
group or aquabonic cannabis growers

240
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,039
maybe

241
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,000
it's moderated by steve dredd steve

242
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,039
raisner

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,240
in their file section they have a

244
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,278
document put out by duke university that

245
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,720
has kind of the

246
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:40,080
um accumulator list of all kinds of

247
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,879
plants where you can get a

248
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,639
a feel for um kind of the content of

249
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,200
some of these plants that are common to

250
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,278
you

251
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,560
so maybe you don't have access to

252
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,000
sunflowers

253
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:55,278
or um you know

254
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,759
asparagus or sesame what other things

255
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,399
are just

256
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,519
crazy off the chart in potassium where

257
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,720
you can

258
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,360
you can extract that so sunflower

259
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,879
and asparagus is way up there in the

260
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,240
potassium levels

261
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,078
and you can jump jump in there and

262
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
learn about that so great great

263
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:17,519
substitute for us in the us

264
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:21,519
because most people have sunflowers

265
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,560
and um it's just a readily available

266
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,240
thing

267
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:29,039
so yeah so first step is charring

268
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,039
our um

269
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,519
our material so this is mostly done i'm

270
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,679
going to throw it on

271
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,879
and we'll let the fire go to work on

272
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,078
this

273
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:42,879
finishing up now the key to biochar

274
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,838
is a limiting of the oxygen you're

275
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,439
allowing to come

276
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,399
into your material what that does

277
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,640
is it causes a kind of releasing or a

278
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,480
discharge of the syngas

279
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:58,159
which is kind of the nutrients if you

280
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,000
will or a lot of a lot of the other

281
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,519
compounds in your material

282
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,240
and it leaves behind a lot of the

283
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,278
mineral and carbon structure

284
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,399
so we're going to

285
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:13,439
go ahead leave the lid on our dutch

286
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,078
oven which allows a little gas to escape

287
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,720
with pressure but it isn't allowing

288
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,919
oxygen

289
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,040
in to turn this to ash we won't get a

290
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,958
white ash

291
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,879
because of the lack of oxygen so that's

292
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,719
key for the biochar process

293
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,240
so i'm just going to throw that right on

294
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,120
top of the fire

295
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,120
stick it in there

296
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,169
and we'll let that heat up i got to get

297
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,399
a hot mitt

298
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:41,519
[Music]

299
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,360
and that that should be done in pretty

300
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,639
short order because it's already mostly

301
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,959
done and then i'll show you

302
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,159
kind of chopping up our sesame and

303
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,439
loading it

304
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:54,879
but um the basic recipe for

305
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,519
um for this is a i'm gonna throw my

306
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,759
headphone on can you hear me all right

307
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,839
all right basic recipe is that we take

308
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,039
this finished biochar

309
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,040
we throw it in a

310
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,799
a sack here i'm gonna use um this is a

311
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,039
nut milk um

312
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,319
bag you can get these at your kind of

313
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,120
local

314
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,440
natural grocer or something like that

315
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,159
you can use a cloth bag cotton works

316
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,160
great

317
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:27,039
um but you need a tea bag for this part

318
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,519
and so you throw that in at about a 1 to

319
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,599
10

320
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,879
ratio you can use a little bit more char

321
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,120
if you want

322
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,360
but don't overdo it don't do 50 percent

323
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,879
char 50 percent

324
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,879
water because you will

325
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,600
just waste it won't all go into solution

326
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,199
you'll be wasting some of that char

327
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,879
so you're better off using about a one

328
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
to ten and

329
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,879
with this we don't use vinegar we use

330
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,879
water to extract

331
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:57,439
and just that um that sitting in water

332
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,360
there's enough pull from the water to

333
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,279
get some of our potassium into solution

334
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,839
we have a water-soluble potassium at the

335
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,159
end

336
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,079
you can agitate you know every couple

337
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,600
days you know just give it a little just

338
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,759
like you do if you're making your

339
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,040
english breakfast tea you know take it

340
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,399
take a little

341
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,759
dipping of the tea bag and uh

342
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,759
salts work way better

343
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:24,399
yeah man yeah

344
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:28,000
you you go with that yeah yeah

345
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,078
um no uh it's it's

346
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,039
it's it's true that lots of people grow

347
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,439
with uh

348
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:39,120
with um those those kind of things and

349
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,440
i'm i'm not uh i'm not a i'm not an anti

350
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,720
to farming methods as much as i'm an

351
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,680
advocate for

352
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,199
ways that we can we can do it less

353
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,919
expensively

354
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,359
and with great yields to affect the

355
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,559
bottom line of the

356
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,600
farmer so if i can get the same yields

357
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,638
and uh and as good or better quality

358
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,720
while spending a tenth as much

359
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,360
we're we're in a better place um

360
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,680
financially and that's a big deal

361
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,480
and in concert with the microorganisms

362
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,239
so

363
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,560
subtle is better that way

364
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,159
all right one second i'm gonna get i'm

365
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:20,078
gonna fill up a bucket of water

366
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:23,198
and get myself a coca-cola

367
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:31,838
wait coca-cola

368
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:31,838
now i want a coca-cola

369
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,799
yeah right we're talking k nf up in the

370
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,799
house yo

371
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,560
i do salt i know it's crazy no it's you

372
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,278
know what

373
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,679
people people like to uh control a

374
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:49,039
little

375
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,799
that's what the internet's for if you

376
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,958
don't have trolls on the internet

377
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,120
i'm not calling you a troll man but yeah

378
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,679
you don't have i love you

379
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,360
if you don't have people throwing stones

380
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,359
you know what good is this

381
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,000
we all get bored we only like negative

382
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,000
news anyway

383
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,600
you're right now okay

384
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:17,039
watching that char go down

385
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:21,039

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,879
barbecue pit that i put a crock down in

389
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,679
like that and build a fire up around

390
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,679
it's

391
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,958
really effective i do uh charred rice

392
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,758
hull oh he is

393
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,239
you guys awesome right chris we love him

394
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,240
um

395
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,560
so yeah charring rice hall is amazing

396
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,720
too lots of silica in that

397
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,719
so

398
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,439
we love negative news so so much that

399
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,079
it's got us

400
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,480
locked in our houses that's how much we

401
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:58,479
love it

402
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,959
just give the microbes a chance to speak

403
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
um

404
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,320
who is i can't

405
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,879
so what would you guys have for

406
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,119
breakfast this morning

407
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,000
i want to know i had granola and a

408
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,480
banana two bananas actually

409
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,240
can't talk coronavirus well you know i

410
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,360
mean okay let's talk about that let's

411
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,799
talk about

412
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,480
viruses and pathogenic stuff

413
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,679
you know they're mostly opportunistic

414
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,000
right and nature abhors a void

415
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,000
uh it's always wanting to be filled by

416
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,600
life it's uh

417
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,919
nature is prone to life that's what life

418
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,040
is

419
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,039
right so when there's a void when we've

420
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,240
killed off all the beneficial organisms

421
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,399
then the things that come in

422
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,159
are the are the very pathogens that are

423
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,759
going to hurt us because that's the only

424
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:02,000
thing that can survive

425
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,000
so the way to um

426
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,400
to work with that and also in concert

427
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,000
with our immune system is to bring in a

428
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,240
biodiversity

429
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,759
of organisms that then sort of do the

430
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,759
work of overpopulating

431
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:17,439
and allowing for an environment where

432
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,519
there's a communication in a community

433
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,199
that goes on within our systems and in

434
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,838
our plant systems and in our

435
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,480
soil systems that are in concert with

436
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,678
one another

437
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,720
and thrive accordingly so

438
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,840
yeah microorganisms

439
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:38,640
have everything to do with helping us

440
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,639
uh deal with pathogenic viruses

441
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,839
that's why we should all get together in

442
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,079
boise so that we can all hug each other

443
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,720
and get our immune systems functioning

444
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,879
and learn about knf from chris trump

445
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,000
when's your class chris

446
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,480
class is i think the first or second

447
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,079
week of

448
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,759
august um you can find it if you go to

449
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:02,879
naturalfarming.co and uh

450
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:05,359
go up to the tabs and click classes um

451
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,679
you can get a link to it there

452
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,038
yeah it'll be fun you can come down

453
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,038
there's a bunch of

454
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,160
people that have been doing this for for

455
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,640
years now

456
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,480
that are going to be returning get to

457
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,080
share their experiences and they end up

458
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,440
being a lot of your

459
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,918
hands-on uh teachers yeah

460
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,038
so tina what's your experience been i

461
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,000
mean you've you've been playing with

462
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:27,679
this now what

463
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,279
what kind of results are you seeing as

464
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,559
far as uh

465
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,558
changes in the garden well i

466
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,480
i applied it for the first year in my

467
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,359
indoor grow my cannabis grow

468
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,160
i only applied it to the cannabis um and

469
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:44,159
it was

470
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,360
an instantly dramatic um especially in

471
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,600
terpene

472
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,719
expression and just overall quality of

473
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,918
the medicine

474
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,000
and then in deriving the medicine like

475
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,200
i do spagyrics or alchemy as well so

476
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,880
just having

477
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,240
the the final expression through

478
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,039
medicine and it's

479
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,160
just mind-blowing but last year i

480
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,279
applied it in my

481
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,600
outdoor garden and um

482
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,399
it's just it just blows my mind i walk

483
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,359
out there and i

484
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,880
lift up the areas of wood chips and

485
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,079
there's just

486
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,120
massive amounts of haifa um and they're

487
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,960
all at the roots

488
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,038
like they're all at the root like of my

489
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,400
garlic i mean they're doing the job that

490
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,480
we know they're supposed to do they're

491
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,919
just out there doing it and

492
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,679
because they're indigenous they've

493
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,480
survived the winter and they're thriving

494
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,080
the season

495
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,120
so yeah it's it's mind-blowing

496
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,119
every day i go out there it's

497
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:38,639

get paid for this

506
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,240
just kidding you can break down metal

507
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,440
with that

508
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,880
yeah you can you can cops carry it if

509
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,200
there's an accident they carry in the

510
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,760
back of their car to totally dissolve

511
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,600
if there's a blood that is going dark

512
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,480
but if there's blood on the street

513
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,279
they'll dissolve it with uh coke yeah

514
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,159
you can you can

515
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:21,119
completely decompose a slab of meat in

516
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,440
like 24 hours drop it in a thing of coke

517
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,079
so really good for your insides right

518
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,080
cleaning out yeah

519
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,559
um that's cool tina the

520
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:34,399
to see those kind of around and

521
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:38,158
communicating with your garlic balls

522
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,480
and that's pretty fun it's

523
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,640
i don't know it's kind of you know as

524
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,240
much as natural farming is a method

525
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,640
um my my favorite aspect or the thing

526
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,839
that i find

527
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,240
that i want to most communicate is

528
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,279
what we're trying to do is is

529
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,599
continually

530
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,119
understand nature a little bit better

531
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,240
science is wonderful for that

532
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,479
and we're actually pushing on

533
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,200
trying to understand as soon as possible

534
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,839
in the scientific community how

535
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,360
microbes make fertilizer monsanto's

536
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:15,199
number one r d

537
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,199
expenditure for

538
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,960
between 2017

539
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,640
or i think it was 20 20 17 18.

540
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,400
this is just when i was researching it

541
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,759
and i was talking to a guy his whole lab

542
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,880
in san diego

543
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,798
was rented for this research and how do

544
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,840
microbes make fertilizer

545
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:38,879
is the question they're asking and

546
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:41,839
the reality is microbes in community

547
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,960
is something we know very little about

548
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,000
even in the

549
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,000
the whole of the scientific

550
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,679
research community we're we're just

551
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,839
beginning to understand

552
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,120
yes we can we can pull out one microbe

553
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,759
and kind of

554
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,879
you know turn it around what does it do

555
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,200
but

556
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,080
um we use the example of human

557
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,759
communities

558
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:05,279
that a um you know if you take a

559
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,679
if you're an alien and you take a

560
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,879
blacksmith shop and you look at it in

561
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,200
isolation

562
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,039
why is this guy keep making tools you

563
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,600
know why does this guy

564
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,359
keep playing with iron it doesn't make

565
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:19,119
sense until you look at the farmer

566
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,959
who's attaching that tool to the back of

567
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,558
a horse or tractor

568
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,200
you know it doesn't make sense in

569
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,359
isolation and we have

570
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,679
sometimes skewed or limited views of

571
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,399
what microbes are good for

572
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,320
if we isolate them and don't understand

573
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,320
that they're a part of a community this

574
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:40,158
thing that they're producing might be

575
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:43,918
one tap in a chain of steps to produce

576
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,960
healthy plants and so it's really a fun

577
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,480
journey and in natural farming

578
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
getting stuff like this where i'm

579
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,279
telling you to go look up

580
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
the accumulation of nutrients that

581
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,839
plants

582
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,798
i am sitting in the heat zone of this

583
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:02,079
fire i'm going to switch sides

584
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,079
it's already a warm day

585
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,839
they say smoke follows beauty right

586
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,360
but to to to look at you know

587
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,839
taking our natural environment and

588
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:22,158
getting some of our

589
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,839
necessary um crop nutrients from it it's

590
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,600
it's such a cool thing and

591
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,000
and a kind of liberating thing for a

592
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,639
farmer who maybe had to go to the salt

593
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,159
store

594
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,559
you know where they're not getting

595
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,280
anything here

596
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,319
i'm in quarantine and i'm producing all

597
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,558
the

598
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,439
farm nutrients for our farm you know in

599
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,119
our house

600
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,960
with my kids and it's drinkable um

601
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:49,359
so fun stuff right right

602
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,240
yeah i want to i want to talk i want to

603
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,839
talk

604
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,000
i want to talk to you sometime about the

605
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,759
faculty of the anaerobics too

606
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,359
like that's speculative anaerobes

607
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,119
yeah yeah it's been really interesting

608
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,519
because like i have really clay soil

609
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,479
so you know the places where the stuff

610
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,639
i've been gathering

611
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,319
that's doing best has been in the sort

612
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,840
of wood chip areas that i've been able

613
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,798
to build but when it comes to my clay

614
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,720
soils it's been

615
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:16,960
really a different kind of

616
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,159
learning process that that what's

617
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,278
actually

618
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,480
eating the clays and making them a

619
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,880
plant available are the this whole

620
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,839
same kind of diversity but deeper down

621
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,799
in the soils

622
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,678
of anaerobic communities that are that

623
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,519
are very much

624
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,400
in this kind of layered consortium

625
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,599
of activity that just brings a whole new

626
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,559
level

627
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,240
to this this expanded awareness of

628
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,319
nature that we learn

629
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,240
by practicing korean natural farming

630
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,918
it's

631
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,400
beautiful super cool yeah

632
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,240
they're they're cool in that um you know

633
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,840
i i'm actually going to jump on

634
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,480
with some people at the future cannabis

635
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:04,079
project um

636
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:07,839
later today yeah two right

637
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,599
i think at three times okay but i don't

638
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,599
what time is it for you you're in

639
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,038
colorado yeah i'm in colorado i thought

640
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,879
it was true but yeah definitely you guys

641
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,599
are checking on that specific

642
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,880
okay oh okay yeah i'm excited to see

643
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,639
that i love the cannabis

644
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,559
uh the future cannabis project they're

645
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,080
amazing they do good work i'm glad

646
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,839
you're gonna be there

647
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,519
and i'm sure we'll talk a lot about that

648
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,798
but the cool thing is

649
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:33,119
they're um a lot of these

650
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,038
anaerobes and and facultative anaerobes

651
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,959
there they don't do

652
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,480
um the same process with breakdown that

653
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,960
like a fungi does

654
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,720
and that they're they're processing

655
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,319
things or breaking them down

656
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,200
but they're leaving behind um

657
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,200
yes i am making

658
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,919
and this is going to be our wsk water

659
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:59,439
soluble potassium

660
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,679
and uh we're going to show how to make

661
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,278
it uh in the next

662
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,720
few minutes here but they're um

663
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:11,519
the the anaerobes uh what's neat

664
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,519
so say like um you know we get into

665
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,440
organic and it's composting

666
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,200
and you send away your compost for an

667
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,759
npk analysis

668
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,200
and uh you know it's it's nothing in

669
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,960
comparison to

670
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,640
uh typical especially if you have a

671
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,480
highly fungal compost

672
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,720
it's nothing in comparison to a typical

673
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,319
salt or whatever

674
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,278
part of that is that fungi actually

675
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,240
bring the nutrients into their body and

676
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,720
create

677
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,720
their their body structure um

678
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:48,879
with those nutrients and that um

679
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,558
to to be able to see those

680
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,278
nutrients that they put into their body

681
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:57,119
structure you'd have to get out the

682
00:26:53,278 --> 00:27:00,319
million kelvin torch or whatever and uh

683
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,278
it's um you know so it's tied up in our

684
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,240
typical

685
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,679
analysts analysis methods for for

686
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,440
looking at nutrients whereas

687
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,759
a lot of these anaerobes or facultative

688
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,600
anaerobes you're going to

689
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,000
they're going to break things down but

690
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,119
they leave kind of the nutrients intact

691
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,720
so you're going to get a

692
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:22,000
much better npk reading

693
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,360
if you're fermenting with an anaerobe

694
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,440
because they're not making the

695
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:28,798
structures in the same way that the um

696
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,080
these big aerobic microbes are but

697
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:34,960
what they leave behind uh is ready food

698
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,558
for um the fungi i'm gonna show you

699
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,798
something you keep talking i'll be right

700
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:38,798
back

701
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,159
so yeah the um the the way that they can

702
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,200
work in tandem

703
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,480
is uh is pretty incredible and to say

704
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,080
one's good and the other's not good is

705
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,159
you know it depends what you're doing

706
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:58,079
what you're trying to accomplish and

707
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:01,600
for me you know farming trees

708
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,918
i actually want a very low

709
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,839
bacterial ratio to my fungal vape ratio

710
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,038
i want a 1000 to 1

711
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:13,519
fungal bacteria what are we looking at

712
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:15,200
so this is that swarm book you know i'm

713
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,798
just giving you all my secrets right now

714
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,880
there are no secrets in life

715
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,879
um so look at the little bugs eating

716
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,320
this this is the clay that i made out of

717
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,559
the facultative

718
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,359
anaerobic bacteria and there's like

719
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,558
millipedes

720
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:31,678
like it's literally crawling

721
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,038
with bugs like everything yeah

722
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,278
they're just eating like this was a

723
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:38,480
whole ball they're eating clay

724
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,159
they ate it this is what they did it

725
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,798
blows my mind

726
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,278
well and some of those bigger um you

727
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,639
know

728
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,640
things like worms and and millipedes uh

729
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,159
part of what they eat is the microbes

730
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,960
themselves so when you're

731
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,399
producing all kinds of of microbes and

732
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,720
getting that total

733
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,079
quantity up you know mommy daddy worm

734
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,679
are getting together and saying hey the

735
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,639
food source is infinite

736
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,840
let's uh let's make lots of babies and

737
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,159
that that whole

738
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,119
engine you know it's kind of think about

739
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,840
like a

740
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,798
giant diesel engine you know you gotta

741
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,639
you gotta kind of charge the glow plug

742
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,798
to get that whole machine moving

743
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,038
eventually you do you want the

744
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:22,879
whole gambit you want the um the big

745
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,960
fungal life but in nature that doesn't

746
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,840
happen instantly

747
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,278
it's not an instant thing i try and kind

748
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,359
of we we talk about

749
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,880
and kind of especially people who live

750
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,038
in the city you know and

751
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,679
they can instantly you know order

752
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:41,119
anything um

753
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,880
sometimes like okay let's now step back

754
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,239
and start to understand what is the

755
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,039
speed of nature

756
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,159
you know how does how does nature work

757
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,319
and you know and

758
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,360
and what's the speed of nature and you

759
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,839
know people

760
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,839
talk about these um you know

761
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:12,319
moving towards that goal of uh you know

762
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,840
nice fungal profiles in comparison to

763
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,079
our bacterial profiles

764
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,519
and if you're starting from scratch or

765
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,720
you're starting with depleted soil

766
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,000
you're starting with

767
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,120
you know solid clay um that takes a

768
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,558
a process you know i usually put it in

769
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:30,319
the realm of three years

770
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:32,558
to really be at full full cycle

771
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,319
um with with the whole diversity of the

772
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,639
microbial community

773
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,319
um and and those anaerobes and factual

774
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,278
data banner roads they play a role in

775
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,158
that

776
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,159
yeah they really do

777
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,079
well yeah

778
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,319
cool man where where on the islands are

779
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:54,158
you i'm guessing you're in the islands

780
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:56,398
um why pahi i'm probably saying that

781
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,399
wrong

782
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,879
cool i'm glad you're you're uh your

783
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,879
garden's going well man

784
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,120
see look at this the smoke's now coming

785
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,120
coming

786
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,038
all right let's check our um let's check

787
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,919
our material see if we got a whole bunch

788
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:17,679
of char so

789
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:20,720
you want to be careful with um

790
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,440
with this because if you're checking it

791
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,240
and you have a bunch of syngas built up

792
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,759
in there

793
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,359
um you don't want to necessarily open it

794
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,558
right over the fire

795
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:36,319
and uh get all that um

796
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:41,599
ignited and it can totally ignite

797
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:45,038
so and it'll rush out the sides

798
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,959
it'll actually shoot out the sides yeah

799
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,679
oops

800
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,720
so let's see you see that here we'll

801
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,519
lean down

802
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,519
let's have a look

803
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:00,398
[Music]

804
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,079
all right so you see if you were

805
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,759
watching from the beginning

806
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,319
you can see how we have a pretty good

807
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,119
change um from what we started with i

808
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,240
had a little bit

809
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:13,359
left over um material

810
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,599
as far as uh oh this is hot a little

811
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,439
leftover material as far as

812
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,480
there's some a little bit of green or

813
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,399
plant structure kind of that

814
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,360
stuff left i wasn't quite to biochar i

815
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,439
did pre-do this so we'd be pretty close

816
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:30,879
and wouldn't have to wait very long but

817
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,159
now we have kind of like

818
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,640
glass you know as far as

819
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,919
this is really really close to finish

820
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,240
biochar i think

821
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,038
it's good enough at this point for what

822
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,038
we're doing

823
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:48,398
so i am going to drop this in a bowl

824
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,398
and we will

825
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,558
we will go ahead and begin with our

826
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,600
water soluble potassium biochar process

827
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,200
and then we'll i'll show you making up

828
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,639
some more if you're starting

829
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,399
from the beginning with uh with this

830
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,480
here let me go ahead and

831
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:11,839
drop this down so you guys can see what

832
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,839
we're working with

833
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,759
and maybe i'm gonna move a little bit

834
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,640
away

835
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:20,640
from our fire

836
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,399
there we go all right how are we looking

837
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,240
can you see the

838
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:32,879
dutch oven yep sweet

839
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,880
knock it over

840
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:43,759
all right so we finished our biochar

841
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,558
of our material um

842
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,440
in this case right now this first round

843
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:52,398
we used

844
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:55,840
um sunflower

845
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:58,798
um next round what we're going to use is

846
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,158
black sesame stock which we'll show you

847
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,398
in a second

848
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,880
is there a difference between the dark

849
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,199
sesame and the white sesame plants

850
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,720
i don't know that off the top of my head

851
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,800
okay i'm sorry

852
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,638
that's okay a look at that duke

853
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,039
university accumulator list you

854
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,039
mentioned

855
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,599
beautiful patinas on this i don't know

856
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,918
ooh

857
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:25,519
all right let me drop it in watch look

858
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,519
at that fall apart can you see that

859
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:36,159
nice yeah so this is completely charred

860
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,079
at this point beautiful um you know if i

861
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,159
drop that on the ground

862
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,879
that'll just turn into a hundred pieces

863
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,280
um it's it's not it doesn't have those

864
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,239
um

865
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,000
organic compounds holding together its

866
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,838
structure anymore we've kind of

867
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,440
we've charred those off and we're left

868
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:56,078
kind of with the plants

869
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,599
you know minerals if you will um not

870
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,440
caught up in organic compounds and

871
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,800
that's what we want because that's

872
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,240
what we're easily extracting

873
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,480
i got to be careful there's a lot of

874
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,838
heat in this so as i have it open and

875
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,559
exposed to the air

876
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,519
i'm going to start turning to ash quite

877
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,000
quickly

878
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,239
and so i need to be careful with that so

879
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,358
i'm going to throw this in here to cool

880
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:22,639
and i'll throw a lid over it or a cover

881
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:26,078
um so that i don't melt my

882
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:29,838
my bag with hot biochar

883
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,519
and we'll make a fresh fresh batch here

884
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:32,639
um using the sesame stock

885
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,559
i'll show you that and then we'll come

886
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:38,319
back to my cooled biochar

887
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,320
and make some wsk

888
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,159
gorgeous

889
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,079
do you think that the the conductivity

890
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,559
of char

891
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,160
helps with the helps with this

892
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,199
particular process

893
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:58,639
definitely definitely we're we're

894
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:00,480
so conductivity kind of mineral um

895
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:02,000
you know i was just talking to steve

896
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,039
reisner over at

897
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,920
potentponics last night and he would

898
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:10,079
take uh

899
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,559
you know he's demonstrating uh a uh

900
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,920
fellaine of a fish and he'd take that

901
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,039
fillet

902
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,519
and uh when he's done he'd take a rag um

903
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,800
you know freshly caught um tilapia or

904
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,920
something he'd take a rag

905
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,519
soaked in a high saline solution he'd

906
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,240
wash his hands with it and he'd lay it

907
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,400
on the filet in front of a big group of

908
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,319
people he's demonstrating for and the

909
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,960
filet would start to jump

910
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,000
uh this you know totally totally

911
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,679
boneless

912
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
skinless filet would start to jump on

913
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,319
the table just freak everybody out

914
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,519
and that's just uh kind of that that

915
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,480
natural reality

916
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,000
of conductivity and and salt so i need

917
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,199
to cover this

918
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,719
or as it cools i'll get some ash and i

919
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,039
want to kind of avoid that so i'm going

920
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,358
to go ahead and throw

921
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,320
something on this to cover it but i

922
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,519
didn't think of that

923
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,519
so let me see what i got

924
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,119
wow i'm going to try that experiment

925
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,838
with a fish

926
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,838
i'm going to do that

927
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:19,838
i want frankenstein

928
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:22,159
yeah nerdy stuff it's so nerdy

929
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,920
i did i did share this oh go ahead sorry

930
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,838
go ahead no you go ahead

931
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,159
i was i shared this earlier but i wanted

932
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:31,039
to like i just read just like

933
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,799
10 minutes before we came on a billion

934
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,358
trillion electrons can be

935
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,359
stored and exchanged in a single gram of

936
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:40,880
biochar

937
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:43,279
very cool a billion trillion

938
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,240
those are not useful facts useless facts

939
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,079
those are

940
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,399
important to understanding how nature

941
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,400
works

942
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,960
that's cool i don't know what to do with

943
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,880
that but uh

944
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,599
i don't either that just means it's

945
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,599
pretty active

946
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,559
i think the fish jumping said it all

947
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:08,800
so i'm gonna just drop this in um i have

948
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,639
my clippers to make sure it all fits

949
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,920
but i think most of it's already the

950
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,118
size

951
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,838
um a friend

952
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,440
at flavor kit on instagram gave me her

953
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:23,039
black sesame stocks

954
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,480
i did not grow these so thank you

955
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:30,159
labor kit at flavor kit she's in

956
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,838
the flavor kits she's into things that

957
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:35,759
that grow and uh talks about them on

958
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:38,239
instagram

959
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,240
sweet

960
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:45,280
you can make this with fresh green

961
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,439
material or dried material

962
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,800
fresh green material will just take a

963
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,400
little longer

964
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,560
um i if if somebody asked me which is

965
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,599
better i would probably say drying your

966
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,239
material

967
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,320
is is a little bit better if you can you

968
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,399
know keep it nice while you're drying it

969
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,838
you don't want it to degrade you know or

970
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
rot or anything like that while you're

971
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:08,078
drying it so

972
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,599
as long as you can dry um properly

973
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,839
you know hanging something in a cool

974
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,838
dark place is a good way to dry it

975
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:17,519
um but yeah if you if you can't if you

976
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:18,239
don't have good control for drying

977
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,800
something

978
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,719
then go ahead and use it fresh um and

979
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,079
that will work as well

980
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:28,559
hey chris yeah i'm learning some i'm

981
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,000
learning something about ig live right

982
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:31,759
now

983
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,280
what's that we have i guess we only

984
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,640
haven't i guess i only have an

985
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,839
hour i have one minute and 30 seconds

986
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:41,199
remaining

987
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:43,679
so um

988
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,199
well what we can do is we can we can

989
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,440
pause right now

990
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,639
um yeah tell everybody you're gonna

991
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,559
restart and start

992
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,799
right back up let's do that if you'd

993
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,559

998
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:11,839
i'm gonna show you how to do it all

999
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:11,838
right all right bye

1000
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:20,079
yay sorry guys i guess there's an hour

1001
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,280
to it

1002
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,200

00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,838
follow me soon

1005
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,800
good info right oh we're learning so

1006
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:32,159
much i'm so

1007
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,400
this is what happens when we get

1008
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:34,879
together we we share information and we

1009
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,480
learn

1010
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,079
so much more than we thought we knew

1011
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,639
here he is

1012
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,640
um here we go you

1013

go over guys it means you're you're

1014
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,318

1015
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,000
here to

1016
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:55,440
you're here to learn hey

hey so uh

1018
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,079
in this world of negative news and and

00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:02,078
craziness where are you finding your

1020

oh man i i i feel like i was born for

1023
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,239
this time i feel like

1024
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,560
i call it the great pause because i feel

1025
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:18,318
like we've been given this time

1026
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:20,480
to like just re renegotiate

1027
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:21,838
our relationship with our world and with

1028
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,318
each other and

1029
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,119
i'm also like an optimist like i just

1030
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:27,679
never stopped

1031
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,599
being hopeful and i'm in love with life

1032
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,919
and i'm in love with nature and dude

1033
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,960
it's like just to see the animals taking

1034
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,159
up being

1035
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,000
affected in such a beautiful way

1036
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:39,838
it makes me happy when the skies are

1037
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,199
blue and you know

1038
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,960
heck yeah heck yeah how about you

1039
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,358
you've got to stay home a little bit

1040
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,519
right i've gotten to stay home from

1041
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:57,119
i like that um my my current uh

1042
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:57,119
comedy source is uh an instagram uh

1043
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:03,039
page called uh neat dads at neat

1044
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,800
yeah it's basically uh endless series of

1045
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,799
dad jokes

1046
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:17,119
nate as in neat like me

1047
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:20,240
like what dads usually aren't yeah well

1048
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,880
or what dads think they are oh oh like

1049
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,519
me

1050
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,519
okay i get you

1051
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:35,039
all right jumping in here with

1052
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,680
our material so i just filled it up

1053
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,800
um you can pack it we can fill this to

1054
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,078
the brim

1055
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,119
and fill every slot totally or we can

1056
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,720
fill it loosely

1057
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:50,720
it's up to you um packing it's great

1058
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:55,279
in that you get the maximum kind of

1059
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:58,159
um accomplished with your with your fire

1060
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,839
or whatever you're doing so however you

1061
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:03,358
want to do it but

1062
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:06,400
pack it or loose wet material or dry

1063
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:08,318
either way works how much you make

1064
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,000
doesn't matter it's how you mix the

1065
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,000
ratio of water

1066
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,280
and your finished material that does

1067
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,838
matter so we're going to do that right

1068
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,720
now

1069
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,599
our biochar from sunflowers cooling and

1070
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,480
we're going to

1071
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,318
throw this on the fire just to show you

1072
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,599
you know step one to zero

1073
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:28,079
or step one to finish with um making

1074
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,760
biochar so

1075
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:35,280
bring this over throw it on the fire i

1076
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:38,160
might need to stoke my fire a little bit

1077
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:42,240
let's see yeah i do need to stoke my

1078
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:44,078
fire just touch here

1079
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,479
i'm gonna grow sesame for the first time

1080
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,519
this year i'm pretty excited

1081
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,280
why why test me what what uh what

1082
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:52,960
benefit or or reason what do you think

1083
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,760
for this reason

1084
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,480
oh cool all right for this very reason

1085
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,160
but also

1086
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,480
yeah but also to eat because i just love

1087
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:02,559
sesame i want to just play with it

1088
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,159
i'm also growing sweet potatoes to try

1089
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,559
to work with the sugar i want to make

1090
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:09,440
imo's using sweet potato

1091
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:09,838
oh we do that in hawaii some really we

1092
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,039
played

1093
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:14,480
yeah we played with sweet potato um

1094
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:16,559
you know we put it through a wood

1095
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:22,719
chipper

1096
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:25,039
oh cool and then dry it

1097
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:25,759
i was drawing the whole potato over my

1098
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:27,519
stove

1099
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,880
and uh i thought next time i'm gonna

1100
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,480
chop so you chop it up

1101
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,480
fresh yeah chop it up fresh and then lay

1102
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,679
it out on a screen

1103
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:41,519
um to dry and you're not

1104
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:44,480
cooking it uh no

1105
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,800
oh you totally can cook it i think that

1106
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,159
would

1107
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,680
that would be maybe even better

1108
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,318
because i think it converts to sugars

1109
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:55,598
right yeah totally positive

1110
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:57,199
um however you know uh if you're making

1111
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,880
a lot of material

1112
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:03,439
that's a lot to cook yeah i know

1113
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,880
okay i got some we're usually making 100

1114
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,720
pound 200 pound

1115
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,160
so we have the you know stuff when

1116
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,318
cooking you know

1117
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,598
uh slop for pigs or whatever we can cook

1118
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,920
potatoes but

1119
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,680
you're still um it's a lot of work to

1120
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,838
cook that much material

1121
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,838
yeah you're right

1122
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:27,598
all right you can see me just fine yep

1123
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:30,559
and our biochar has cooled

1124
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,559
so i can handle it

1125
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:37,919
this is how well can you see this

1126
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:40,559
there we go pretty shiny yeah

1127
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,240
and so just i mean i could literally

1128
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,838
crush this into powder

1129
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:47,279
with no effort it's completely charred

1130
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,519
and black all the way through

1131
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,800
and you get this cool shiny patina

1132
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:55,280
that's just a little bit

1133
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,280
of the kind of organic

1134
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:58,399
oils and

1135
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:05,760
compounds left behind but um

1136
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:09,759
yeah really really cool just um

1137
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,599
neat to have this what was solid

1138
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,000
kind of material just fall apart in your

1139
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,280
hands and so a really finished

1140
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,800
biochar is ideal for this

1141
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:24,000
now i have my my teabag structure

1142
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:27,359
i'm going to go ahead and hopefully

1143
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,679
none of this is hot but i'll be adding

1144
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:34,480
water to it immediately so

1145
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:40,000
no we've cooled pretty nicely just warm

1146
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,000
otherwise i'd hurt my container here

1147
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,200
so i'm going to make a gallon

1148
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,400
and so a tenth of a gallon by volume is

1149
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,960
about what i want

1150
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,960
for charcoal and so

1151
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,358
this is about right this is kind of the

1152
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,480
target amount

1153
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,598
so i got about a softball here of

1154
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,519
material

1155
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,519
in my bag

1156
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,440
hi sister

1157
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,440
and so now what we're gonna do

1158
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:22,160
i'm just making tea so um

1159
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:25,759
clean you know cold water if you have a

1160
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:27,358
little bit of chlorine i probably

1161
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,280
wouldn't even be that worried about it

1162
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,519
because we're not

1163
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,640
dealing with microbes here and

1164
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:36,079
chloramine actually

1165
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:39,519
or chlorine actually occurs in nature

1166
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,440
thank you for saying that helps to to um

1167
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,358
actually make available nutrients so

1168
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,679
it's a it's an interesting thing

1169
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:47,759
in the concentrations we put it in our

1170
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:50,239
our water and stuff it's not good

1171
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,319
but uh in general it's not an evil thing

1172
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,439
it's a part of

1173
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:58,639
our soil naturally i would probably

1174
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,480
want to avoid chloramine to negate

1175
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:01,759
chloramine you can add humic acid but

1176
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,639
that's not really helpful

1177
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,640
in this so

1178
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:10,558
i am just going to go ahead and pour in

1179
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:13,920
my water

1180
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,920
over my tea bag here

1181
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,079
and i want to cover this um just to keep

1182
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,240
critters out i don't need to seal it it

1183
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:30,240
can it's going to be a breathable lid

1184
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:34,318
um but i want to keep critters from

1185
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:36,159
messing with my material so now

1186
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:37,759
what i'm dealing with let's see if i can

1187
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:41,118
switch you up for light

1188
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:45,200
purposes what i'm dealing with is

1189
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:49,280
a container full of water with a tea bag

1190
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:51,199
full of biochar made with

1191
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,359
sunflower and i'm going to let this sit

1192
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,919
for seven to ten days

1193
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:58,318
and then i pull off my tea bag and i

1194
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,680
have my water-soluble potassium

1195
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:03,838
on the shelf ready to go and you use it

1196
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,919
at a rate of one to a thousand

1197
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:07,519
when applying and you can add it into

1198
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,880
your maintenance solution

1199
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:12,960
um or you know

1200
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,240
you can add it in even at a rate of one

1201
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,519
to two thousand

1202
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,279
um in something like uh you know

1203
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,599
vegetative growth formula

1204
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,880
which would be maintenance solution plus

1205
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,880
fish amino acid

1206
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,318
you could bring some of this in um it

1207
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:31,200
can be included in pretty much

1208
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:34,400
any of your applications as you need it

1209
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,039
so really easy to make if you have the

1210
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,358
tools

1211
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:44,400
and definitely easy to use

1212
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:46,880
as it's just sprayed on in foliar manner

1213
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,079
so i'm going to set that on the shelf

1214
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,800
and i come back to it um

1215
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,960
in about a week i mean you have

1216
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,599
questions on that i mean is it

1217
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,800
that same pretty straightforward yeah so

1218
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,720
are you going to keep it at one to a

1219
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,039
thousand all the way through

1220
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,799
and flat generally in use i'm gonna keep

1221
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:07,599
it at one to a thousand

1222
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,079
or one to two thousand meaning a l a

1223
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,960
lighter

1224
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,318
even a lighter deletion or a uh diluting

1225
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,760
it more

1226
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:18,558
um you just you bringing it in

1227
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,119
somewhat regularly i don't need a lot of

1228
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,559
it

1229
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,680
this is um easily taken up through the

1230
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,200
um

1231
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:30,719
the leaf tissue itself so yeah nice

1232
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:33,919
that's gorgeous so simple crazy simple

1233
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:37,118
yeah and so now my

1234
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,880
biochar is going and this will probably

1235
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,680
take

1236
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,559
you know dry material like this will

1237
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,598
probably take

1238
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:50,240
a good 15-20 minutes

1239
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,240
to fully um make biochar

1240
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,359
nice yeah so we're having people ask

1241
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:57,199
about other

1242
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,598
plants have you heard of anyone using

1243
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:00,078
banana peel or bio charring banana peel

1244
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,119
for these

1245
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:06,400
for this for the potassium i

1246
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:09,200
haven't and i don't know

1247
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,160
what the potassium content of it by uh

1248
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:14,078
banana

1249
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:17,358
peel is um i will take this opportunity

1250
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:20,839
to discourage people as

1251
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:25,199
i as much as i can from using

1252
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:30,480
bananas from the store to make your fpj

1253
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:35,118
yeah especially if they're full of

1254
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:39,199
pesticides etc from the typical um

1255
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:41,760
um banana creation in the world today

1256
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:42,799
yeah so don't go to the store and buy

1257
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,359
your

1258
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:51,839
gnarly banana and uh use it on your

1259
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:51,838
favorite things

1260
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,039
but yeah you could try banana peels i

1261
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:00,800
don't know off hand i didn't i

1262
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:04,000
they're the one the reason i gave you um

1263
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:06,559
asparagus and sunflower is it that the

1264
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,559
absolute highest in the accumulator

1265
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,920
category for potassium

1266
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,559
so these are we're talking way higher

1267
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,920
than

1268
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,839
things you typically think that have

1269
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:21,680
potassium yeah

1270
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:24,000
excellent alaska grow sunflowers

1271
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:26,879
in the summer somebody's asking if they

1272
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,079
can use bananas in alaska yeah you can

1273
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,079
use organic bananas

1274
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,400
if if that's all you can get you know

1275
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,799
ultimately you gotta use what you can

1276
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,358
get

1277
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,359
and uh so i'm not gonna you know throw

1278
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:41,920
stones at you doing the best you can

1279
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:43,358
um i can't speak to bananas i'd have to

1280
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,079
go look it up

1281
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:47,838
yeah there were just some questions

1282
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,280
there and i almost feel like some people

1283
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:51,119
are concerned

1284
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,480
with the fact that we need to start

1285
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:57,440
utilizing our waste

1286
00:52:52,480 --> 00:53:00,159
stream if we can't stop eating bananas

1287
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,039
then perhaps there's a use for the waste

1288
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:02,558
stream of it

1289
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:04,639
so i think i'm going to hear it on that

1290
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,960
level but i think if if i had an

1291
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,719
option between sunflower and asparagus

1292
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,480
at the end of its season or bananas i

1293
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:13,679
would definitely go with the sunflower

1294
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,838
asparagus or sesame

1295
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:17,759
yeah yeah and that we can we can look it

1296
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,880
up that that sheet we talked about

1297
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,680
on um aquaponics grower uh

1298
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,400
aquaponic cannabis growers um at the

1299
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,000
page

1300
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:31,039
on facebook and they have a

1301
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
files section and you can find

1302
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,599
by duke university file on accumulators

1303
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,480
and you can look up something that you

1304
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,480
have in your area

1305
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:44,800
that's that's potassium rich if you want

1306
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,920
yeah and i'm growing up tobacco and

1307
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,720
tobacco stem

1308
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,000
and i'm using a tobacco fpga and i'm

1309
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,239
using the vinegar

1310
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,519
after the fpga and i'm really i don't

1311
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:56,639
know what the qual i don't know

1312
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:58,639
the compounds that make it such a

1313
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:00,400
good one i gotta correct myself real

1314
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:03,838
quick tobacco

1315
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:08,639
tobacco i'm sorry i've totally i just

1316
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,639
mixed up my things tobacco is um

1317
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:13,358
is the potassium source typically taught

1318
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,359
in korean natural farming

1319
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:16,880
i'm showing you sesame which is a

1320
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:19,440
typical straight

1321
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,358
phosphorus source uh sesame is a

1322
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,800
phosphorus accumulator

1323
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:27,440
and so um yeah

1324
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,839
sorry about that tobacco is a typical

1325
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,480
it's a

1326
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:31,358
typical potassium that makes it makes

1327
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,599
the head

1328
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:38,480
um but yeah so amazing oh my god

1329
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,079
yeah so tobacco stems would be excellent

1330
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,519
as your potassium source

1331
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:46,559
and then yeah so far with sesame um

1332
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:48,400
for phosphorus so tobacco would be an

1333
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:51,920
excellent potassium source

1334
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,480
sesame for phosphorus we would not knit

1335
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,720
then

1336
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,159
typically when we use bones to make a

1337
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:59,759
phosphorus we got a

1338
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:02,318
calcium phosphate um with

1339
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,240
with sesame we're going for a straight

1340
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:07,119
kind of phosphorus

1341
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:08,798
and so we do do it the same way char it

1342
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,599
and then soak it in water

1343
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:12,318
um for for a phosphorous nutrient that's

1344
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,599
beautiful

1345
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:19,199
i'm glad we got there that's gorgeous

1346
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:21,039
okay yeah

1347
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,639
and i just since people are joining and

1348
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:23,279
maybe some new people have joined i want

1349
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:24,719
to make sure

1350
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,280
everyone understands that you're doing

1351
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:30,719
another presentation this afternoon

1352
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:33,119
uh with the future cannabis

1353
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,318
the future cannabis cannabis project

1354
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,200
project

1355
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:38,719
um is it youtube or facebook do you know

1356
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:42,000
i think it's youtube

1357
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:45,480
um yeah yeah so

1358
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,039
you can check them out at the

1359
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,318
futurecanvasproject.com

1360
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:52,480
and um yeah it might

1361
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:54,798
it would probably be an interesting one

1362
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,920
um as you know some some people

1363
00:55:54,798 --> 00:56:01,920
um there you know question uh the

1364
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,920
advocacy of korean natural farming and

1365
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,400
you know and i think that's healthy to

1366
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,039
have those kind of discussions on

1367
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,400
you know what do you see in in your your

1368
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:13,679
attempts to

1369
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,480
you know promote a regenerative

1370
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:17,358
agricultural society and um and how do

1371
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,679
they differ and

1372
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:21,358
so that that'll be some of what we get

1373
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,719
into you over there today

1374
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:27,838
nice all in love and uh

1375
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:31,118
yeah should be good nice

1376
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:32,960
totally yeah

1377
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,240
yeah do you want to uh walk around a

1378
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,240
little bit and look at uh

1379
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:40,000
fpga materials sure let's do that

1380
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:43,759
because it's now it's a now thing it's

1381
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,920
now time to be doing these fpgas

1382
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,599
yeah so what don't you want to use for

1383
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,159
an fpga

1384
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,160
we covered it a little before but you

1385
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:54,960
don't want to use

1386
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:56,399
um conventional produce that you're

1387
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,240
buying at your typical store even

1388
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,200
organic produce it's basically bleach

1389
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:02,399
washed

1390
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:03,279
um even if it is organic they're able to

1391
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,519
bleach wash it

1392
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,359
um and so you don't have any of your

1393
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:09,759
indigenous

1394
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:11,199
microbes or the things that typically

1395
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,400
are found on that plant to ferment

1396
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,199
itself

1397
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,079
so you'll typically get some weird

1398
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,838
growths

1399
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:22,559
and strain of blooms of green stuff

1400
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:24,798
as whatever's in your air is trying to

1401
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:28,000
digest this for

1402
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:29,838
subjects or item

1403
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,599
you might be losing you might lose

1404
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:34,719
connection as you're as you're

1405
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,720
traveling outwardly

1406
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:41,199
sorry about that i jumped off of uh i

1407
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,358
jumped off of wi-fi i was walking away

1408
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:47,199
from the wi-fi

1409
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:51,199
yeah yeah

1410
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:54,318
yeah so um you know if if you don't have

1411
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:56,639
a plants you know indigenous microbes

1412
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:58,798
that live on that plant and grow with it

1413
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,879
um you'll be relying on whatever's in

1414
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:02,639
your air whatever was on the hand of the

1415
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,200
grocer or the 10 people that touched

1416
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:05,199
that

1417
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:06,480
banana before you those microbes are

1418
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:08,159
what you're going to be relying on to

1419
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,358
ferment your

1420
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:13,118
fpj rather than if something still has

1421
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:16,159
its microbes present it can

1422
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,838
ferment itself in those microbes so i

1423
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:21,039
just discourage from

1424
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:24,880
store-bought even if you live in a city

1425
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:26,480
a short travel once a year just outside

1426
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,680
to find a place where

1427
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:33,039
some great healthy weeds grow abundantly

1428
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:35,598
would be great would be enough

1429
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:38,079
another thing not to use is poisonous

1430
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,079
plants

1431
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,440
you're going to be consuming this you

1432
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,039
don't want to use here's an example of a

1433
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:48,639
poisonous plant

1434
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:48,639
growing here does anybody know what this

1435
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:52,159
is oh

1436
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,279
it's queen anne's lace

1437
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,318
and so this this is pretty toxic and

1438
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:04,239
would make a terrible fpj

1439
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:06,318
because i wouldn't want to be

1440
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:07,598
introducing those to the veggies my kids

1441
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:12,480
are going to eat

1442
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:15,280
and yeah so definitely don't want

1443
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,400
highly poisonous plants another thing

1444
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,798
you would

1445
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,400
be only have to learn once and you might

1446
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:22,159
not survive it would be to use like a

1447
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,280
poison oak or poison ivy

1448
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:27,519
you'd probably die um as as that

1449
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,960
material got into your lungs or your

1450
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:34,639
digestive system so um i was can i tell

1451
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,639
what can i tell a tobacco story

1452
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,280
because i do use tobacco cj but i think

1453
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,119
i am only going to use it in drench you

1454
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,000
don't want to use it as a foliar because

1455
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,960
i decided

1456
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,480
to start eating some of my fpjs on a

1457
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,599
demonstration to some

1458
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,159
uh young horticulture students and i had

1459
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:54,240
a minute amount of the tobacco fpj

1460
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:55,920
it didn't affect me right away but i

1461
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:59,358
woke up the next morning and

1462
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,440
as i got up to walk out of bed i

1463
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:03,039
was walking in a different direction

1464
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,599
than where i was looking so i literally

1465
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,239
had to

1466
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,440
focus somewhere else to walk the

1467
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:11,279
straight line

1468
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:13,760
it has a neurological effect wow

1469
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,960
that is quite profound and lasts for

1470
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,880
quite a while

1471
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,480
all right yes hemlock poison hemlock

1472
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,240
they're right i think

1473
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,240
it might be synonymous with queen anne's

1474
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:25,358
lace but it is hemlock

1475
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:30,078
i always i think called it queen please

1476
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:30,078
um so what are good things to use

1477
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,559
i love comfrey everyone's asking about

1478
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:39,598
comfrey coffee is amazing

1479
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:42,160
coffee is amazing so are dandelions

1480
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,680
this is just a side pasture we don't

1481
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:45,920
cultivate

1482
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:47,440
i'm in a new property dandelions are

1483
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,880
amazing

1484
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,519
these guys the leaves the new growing

1485
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,119
tips

1486
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:56,239
all amazing i have this other plant here

1487
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,400
it's prolific

1488
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:59,919
weed i know it's not toxic because

1489
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,559
animals can eat it readily

1490
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,838
i don't have the identification but this

1491
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:07,119
stuff is great

1492
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:10,318
always healthy the bees love it

1493
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:13,599
no no bug pressure and

1494
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:15,599
it grows abundantly

1495
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,880
the the key is if something is growing

1496
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:20,000
abundantly without

1497
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,400
care it is so good

1498
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,679
at accumulating nutrients from your soil

1499
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,318
in your area

1500
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:29,279
that it's going to be nutrient rich if

1501
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:29,279
you start using

1502
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:32,558
you know things just because you're like

1503
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:34,639
oh i know that tastes good

1504
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,920
but it struggles in your area or it's

1505
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:38,000
anemic

1506
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,599
that the the nutrient density in that

1507
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
tissue is going to be actually

1508
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,440
less than just some weed that you think

1509
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,838
nothing about

1510
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,000
so yeah find find things in your area

1511
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:51,039
that are abundant and thriving

1512
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,280
we have this big patch of dock which is

1513
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:54,480
an

1514
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:58,319
edible weed um and

1515
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:01,838
i'll be using fpj

1516
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:04,159
and i mean dandelion

1517
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:06,000
dog and a few other things to make fpj

1518
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:08,480
actually tomorrow

1519
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,519
i have a question about the dandelion

1520
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,280
yeah

1521
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:14,719
so at dawn the dandelion flowers are not

1522
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,640
open

1523
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:18,879
so do you think that there's a different

1524
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:19,679
mechanism at work when it comes to like

1525
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,079
that

1526
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:23,118
the undifferentiated stuff that you're

1527
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,280
trying to harvest

1528
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,680
hormones and enzymes is it different in

1529
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:30,160
a flower that's not opening it

1530
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:32,318
at dawn or do we harvest it at a

1531
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:35,838
different time

1532
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:38,719
oh yeah um always at dawn

1533
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:39,440
and it'll be um they're accumulating

1534
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:41,838
nutrients

1535
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,519
and and processing the nutrients they

1536
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:44,719
accumulated through photosynthesis the

1537
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:47,920
day before

1538
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:49,679
and they're not um they're not working

1539
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,440
hard to regulate their temperature

1540
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:53,919
so they you know at the end of the day

1541
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,280
we're tired uh a plant's the same way at

1542
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,240
the end of the day they're tired from

1543
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,160
photosynthesis

1544
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,838
and that big engine they're running and

1545
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:01,440
then regulating their temperature

1546
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:03,038
early in the morning they've taken all

1547
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,838
this rest time to

1548
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:07,039
kind of process all their nutrients and

1549
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:09,038
store them

1550
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:10,160
for into their growing tips for new

1551
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:13,200
growth

1552
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:14,159
this is uh i have one in hawaii but this

1553
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:17,358
is my new

1554
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:19,279
toy for boise i've been missing my

1555
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:20,798
uh cement maker so i'll be making my

1556
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,798
episode in this

1557
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:28,318
tomorrow it's exciting

1558
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:29,759
that's a lot of fpga yeah well i'll only

1559
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,599
make it once you know i just

1560
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,000
encourage people you know you don't have

1561
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:37,039
to make new stuff all the time

1562
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,920
and they'll make it once for a year and

1563
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:41,760
you're you're done making stuff um as

1564
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,838
fun as it is to make this stuff

1565
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,000
it's not really the point of natural

1566
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:49,119
farming the point is

1567
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:53,519
productive crops

1568
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:56,559
with a low amount of effort as possible

1569
01:03:53,519 --> 01:04:00,000
and yeah yeah

1570
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:03,119
so i ha i had an experience

1571
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,719
how close to harvesting plants should

1572
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,280
you be making the fpj

1573
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:08,480
because i last year i did i would go out

1574
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,039
harvest as much as i can

1575
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,159
then spend part of the day processing

1576
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:13,920
this year i'm

1577
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:15,838
i'm gathering smaller amounts and

1578
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,599
processing it almost immediately

1579
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:19,440
is there a difference in quality when

1580
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:22,960
you do that

1581
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:26,720
um yeah i mean

1582
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:29,920
ideally you do want to process it asap

1583
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:32,000
um you know having stuff like

1584
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,200
uh cement mixer and some other things

1585
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,559
that are used to process

1586
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:39,439
quickly can be huge

1587
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,319
yeah so i can get a big batch done first

1588
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,119
thing

1589
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:45,519
um but yeah as best you can if it takes

1590
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:49,119
you a few hours to chop everything

1591
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:51,119
but you got it you still have you know

1592
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,960
those nutrients aren't flowing back down

1593
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,640
or leaving those root tips you still

1594
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,960
have them there

1595
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:57,759
and so we're we're kind of hopeful that

1596
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,679
that's

1597
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,440
um we're not losing a whole lot in the

1598
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:04,879
processing time

1599
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,159
wait i don't have a data driven answer

1600
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,838
on that for you

1601
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:09,838
yeah yeah yeah that sounds good

1602
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,480
gorgeous totally let's let's do a quick

1603
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:17,519
peek and see how

1604
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:20,000
charred we are so far on this uh

1605
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:23,838
material so we just put this on what 10

1606
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,838
minutes ago

1607
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:30,480
i'm gonna burn my bench here

1608
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,480
that's okay

1609
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,440
look at that that's so pretty

1610
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:43,358
so we're a good way on okay i gotta put

1611
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,240
that on so right away just by taking

1612
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:46,960
that off

1613
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,959
because of the heat i started ashing so

1614
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,039
i've lost some of my material by

1615
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,199
checking that

1616
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,480
because of the heat as soon as i exposed

1617
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,159
it to oxygen

1618
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,159
right away in the center you might not

1619
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,838
have been able to see it but

1620
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:05,440
ash started forming and i started losing

1621
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:07,920
material quality so

1622
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,920
it's a really important balance between

1623
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,599
oxygen

1624
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,838
in this process so we want to make sure

1625
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,880
that lid stays on nicely

1626
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:21,279
so that the material cooks

1627
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,280
outside of an oxygen-rich environment

1628
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:26,558
yeah is there a different quality in

1629
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,920
biochar depending on your region

1630
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:33,599
no no yeah it's all the process

1631
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:37,039
quality of process is yeah

1632
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,920
okay and how long can fpga be stored

1633
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,599
typically

1634
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,400
like and i know it depends on how you

1635
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:46,160
handle it and how you make it initially

1636
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:49,838
but is there a decline in

1637
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:50,719
quality over time um i i typically tell

1638
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:53,440
people to

1639
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:54,639
to make it um for for six months because

1640
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:58,639
that's absolutely

1641
01:06:54,639 --> 01:07:02,000
safe um however if somebody's storing

1642
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:04,960
their um material

1643
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,039
and you know in the sun in a hot

1644
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,480
environment or don't have a good cover

1645
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:12,640
on it you can cause fpga to deteriorate

1646
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,400
just from poor storage technique so

1647
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:18,239
finding a concrete floor

1648
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:19,440
in a cool dark room um your your fpj

1649
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:22,639
will last for

1650
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:25,358
a good year um and i

1651
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:26,480
i have some that you know it just was

1652
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:29,920
processed properly

1653
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:33,199
and stored nicely and

1654
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:36,960
it's good five years later but some

1655
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:40,000
sometimes stored improperly or maybe

1656
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:42,559
too much moisture or too little moisture

1657
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,039
fpga can accumulate moisture and then go

1658
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,680
off

1659
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,400
kind of start getting towards alcohols

1660
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:48,960
and vinegars

1661
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,798
or too little moisture fpga can start to

1662
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:55,358
evaporate or lose moisture

1663
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:57,599
and get very much like a syrup or even

1664
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:58,558
not syrup more like a taffy you know

1665
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:03,440
where just

1666
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:05,760
it's so thick and you'd have to re-add

1667
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,039
water to even you know it comes out like

1668
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,960
a like a goo

1669
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,359
you can hold it and slowly drip it you

1670
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,358
know so i've done that

1671
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,960
yeah and that's just a running out of

1672
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:17,600
water in a dry environment so it kind of

1673
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,359
depends on your environment and hawaii

1674
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,798
it would be typical that things would

1675
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,440
accumulate moisture

1676
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,640
in idaho it's typical that things run

1677
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:27,198
out of moisture

1678
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,798
so same thing with im02 i'm spritzing my

1679
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:32,798
imo 2 in idaho

1680
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:34,560
to keep it from overly drying out okay

1681
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:36,838
it's good to do that with your amos too

1682
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,960
you don't want to let them dry out

1683
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:43,359
either

1684
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:46,158
i am o2 could you spray wca and w

1685
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,679
calcium phos until two weeks before chop

1686
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:48,719
i'm not saying that you should but could

1687
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:51,759
you

1688
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:54,158
anything microbials and no so um

1689
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,798
i assume you're talking about cannabis

1690
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:58,639
and

1691
01:08:54,798 --> 01:09:01,679
um what i

1692
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:04,719
have um experienced

1693
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,520
um in interacting with just great

1694
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:09,198
growers

1695
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:11,759
um is the kind of

1696
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:12,238
absorption qualities that some of your

1697
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,679
your

1698
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:16,798
your plant has and uh so what you want

1699
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:18,880
to be aware of is

1700
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:20,079
anything that could affect flavor

1701
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,000
especially if you're

1702
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:23,359
you're going down to an isolate or some

1703
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,479
sort of

1704
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:28,000
after market processing or after chop

1705
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:31,439
processing

1706
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
if the flavor of the vinegar or the

1707
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,119
flavor

1708
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,158
of the kind of calcium phosphate were to

1709
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:39,519
affect

1710
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:42,559
your quality that would be a huge no-no

1711
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:46,000
and so you need to be careful

1712
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:48,239
um spraying on the leaves right before

1713
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,279
you're harvesting

1714
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:52,318
and even in the in the flowering process

1715
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:54,719
that you don't

1716
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,320
negatively affect flavor however a lot

1717
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:59,198
of these nutrients

1718
01:09:56,319 --> 01:09:59,679
can be taken up in the root zone so you

1719
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:01,759
can

1720
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,960
take the same principle the same

1721
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,920
application rate

1722
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,960
and put it in your watering system so

1723
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,000
that you're getting this

1724
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,399
this feed but not putting it directly on

1725
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,439
those

1726
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:16,559
those nodules of oils and

1727
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:19,519
all flavor that will absorb it and

1728
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,039
potentially affect the flavor it going

1729
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,239
through the root system and going up to

1730
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:24,479
the plant will have

1731
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:26,238
a drastically different effect it won't

1732
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:28,238
it won't have such a um

1733
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:31,519
kind of lasting flavor effect so yeah be

1734
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:33,678
careful caution to you

1735
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,679
yeah i usually do foliar up until about

1736
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,560
five weeks into flower and then i go to

1737
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:38,319
drench

1738
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,679
that's how i typically handle it

1739
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:42,799
personally but everybody

1740
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,679
yeah yeah and other other growers only

1741
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,719
do

1742
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:48,319
foliar in vegetative growth and once

1743
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:51,520
they get into flower they

1744
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:52,238
only do drench and other growers i've

1745
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,080
talked to you

1746
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:56,799
you know don't think it affects labor at

1747
01:10:54,079 --> 01:11:00,158
all i am not

1748
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,600
have to beg ignorance on that

1749
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:04,079
all because i don't know i haven't

1750
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,120
tested it

1751
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:08,640
yeah and side by side

1752
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:10,960
let's just briefly mention the

1753
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:14,480
importance of that oh my goodness right

1754
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,480
it's how we gonna grow as a community

1755
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,600
um question about fermented sea water

1756
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,800
fermented sea water is already diluted

1757
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:26,239
when you made it so um yeah

1758
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:28,400
you you can go ahead so seawater is

1759
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:29,279
diluted i think it's a one to thirty

1760
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:33,359
seawater

1761
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:36,800
a one to seven hundred lab

1762
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:40,000
and a one to maybe 300 fpj

1763
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,400
and that those are already

1764
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,640
diluted quantities and so you can apply

1765
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:47,039
it you can also cut it fifty percent

1766
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,440
um or more if you want it to kind of

1767
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:49,439
spread

1768
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,840
okay yeah yeah i love it well thank you

1769
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,679

we just

1789
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:37,039

talk about all kinds of good stuff and

1792
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:44,238
uh i went ahead and pulled my

1793
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,520
sesame stocks off the fire but i'll

1794
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:49,359
leave them closed

1795
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:53,280
to cool so that i don't get ashy um

1796
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:55,279
as it uh finishes but we'll get um

1797
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:57,519
get a bit more charcoal being made as it

1798
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:59,599
just sits in this super hot pot

1799
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,159
um but i don't want to lift it before it

1800
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,880
cools unless i could cool it quickly

1801
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:06,158
and because i'm not going to add this to

1802
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,960
water right away i'm just going to leave

1803
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:09,679
it in there

1804
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,158
and then this you see that beautiful

1805
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:12,239
kind of

1806
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:14,559
patina color that's happening in the

1807
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:18,079
water yeah that's gorgeous

1808
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:21,199
yeah so that's you know kind of our

1809
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:24,238
our nutrient our mineral in there

1810
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:26,000
diffusing into our water column yeah

1811
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:30,000
darkened over time

1812
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,679
yeah and it'll continue to do that nice

1813
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,079
and seven days on that just like every

1814
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:36,399
other application seven to ten you know

1815
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:37,519
um yeah you don't want to pull it crazy

1816
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:39,599
early but

1817
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,920
if you go a day or two over it's not the

1818
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,960
end of the world

1819
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,800
but you don't want to leave it in there

1820
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,319
for a month um you can get some really

1821
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:51,039
weird things happening

1822
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:51,039
um with just stuff growing and stuff

play with all of this and and enjoy the

1828
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,920
the journey yeah yeah

1829
