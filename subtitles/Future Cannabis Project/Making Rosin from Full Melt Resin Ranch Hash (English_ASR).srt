pull that off a bit a little bit

153
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:54,109
simply a 50% yield I'm sorry to say oh

154
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:54,109
oh there's still more yeah

155
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,270
boom there you go that's like a dream

156
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:24,279
well I'm curious because if but like it

157
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:25,420
should be one third of the ratio just

158
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,859
cuz this is gonna end up being like

159
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,740
super small amount of diamonds who want

160
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:32,379
to get a fatty amount or like an even

161
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,480
ratio or some Island right now

162
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,950
what bank with some some good amount so

163
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,950
it's like a pretty deep sea some

164
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:46,299
diamonds and then like even it might be

165
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:57,430
less than I have a grandma last time

166
00:22:46,299 --> 00:23:10,329
today know why empresa nice oh there you

167

171
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,599
what was it on the way through 70 yeah

172
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:47,930
that's two point seven half that's like

173
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:47,929
stir-crazy out Jesus

174
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:12,569
77% whopping their services in Wildman

175
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:14,158
oh so yeah I don't know what the ratio I

176
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:16,618
guess would be one still do this one

177
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,809
again of a higher temp oh yeah turn it

178
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:20,808
up right now

179
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:20,808
yeah

180
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:31,499
so yeah we got Graham to make the goods

181
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:33,659
out of those may not be the better yet

182
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:36,058
okay yeah guys so you're getting exactly

183
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:39,960
you know one young put these into this

184
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:41,038
much it's really easy Matt yeah it'll be

185
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:46,590
all right

186
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:49,788
calculated okay so I'm really anxious to

187
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:49,788
fight at this stuff yeah

188
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,700
[Music]

189
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,700
oh gosh

190
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:14,840
here's a little trick associated to one

191
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,890
if you lock your fingers you just take

192
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,889
the glove off your finger

193
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:49,439
[Music]

194
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:18,230
yeah

195
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,230
pretty honking

196
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,490
way back

197
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,249
[Music]

198
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:27,329
hit honestly though we don't look that

199
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:27,329
much better than his hash

200
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:46,930
I mean I said there's more definition

201
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,900
Oh Barry speaking

202
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:04,089
yeah

203
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:55,469
now watch week watching the watch

204
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:10,329
walking with the retard oh okay there

205
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,210
was very much done with him

206
00:30:10,329 --> 00:30:14,710
really fucking activated now the bird

207
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,269
about ten minutes

208
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:21,269
oh really right there I thought yeah

209
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:21,269
yeah

210
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:12,429
that's literally the most gorgeous

211
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,430
fucking time

212
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:53,750
the second squish real quick here 180

213
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:56,409
degrees now Wolverton 160 oh nice all

214
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:58,549
that in just one blow real oh I figured

215
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:12,160
this would have to go hi

216
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:16,389
yeah but maybe we should have no such is

217
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,390
who fear why rural

218
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,930
Oh so he said why do you whip it for

219
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:47,369
consistency people are commenting hell

220
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:52,380
yeah well size micron byesies

221
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:54,239
I believe we're using 25 right well I'm

222
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:59,640
not sure what size micron bags of the

223
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:03,960
hash to use there but 25 microns 92 149

224
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:09,210
there you go I know that and then yeah

225
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:11,100
my silkscreen here's 25 micron which is

226
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:14,630
a little lower than you really need to

227
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:18,359
go for doing hash rosin 37 is my usual

228
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:21,000
but this stuff is really I just makes it

229
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:25,500
really clean and then it's also double

230
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,519
usable uh EE used as the thing that we

231
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:32,609
wrap the rosin back into to make the HCA

232
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,970
extract out of it the fuck daddy so

233
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:39,000
thanks and then yeah Emily and a weapon

234
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:41,640
it does it just kind of kicks in the

235
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,470
nucleation process which helps to cause

236
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,360
it to butter or change consistencies

237
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:52,860
which you need it to be in that kind of

238
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:55,079
tacky ER consistency or less less messy

239
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:57,449
before you can actually make it into the

240
00:33:55,079 --> 00:34:00,240
THC a effectively otherwise most of it

241
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:03,029
was booze out of the bag this one was on

242
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,559
with right this is what the first grand

243
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:06,779
that we didn't live yet this is the

244
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,668
second ground that you whipped on camera

245
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,230
and writing it so you can see the

246
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:11,909
difference between the two clearly this

247
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,490
one was just whipped for it you know a

248
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:19,829
little while that one it was not whipped

249
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:21,989

hands you know if people are knowing the

261
00:34:51,719 --> 00:35:00,239
product and they're isolating it clean

262
00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:03,119
methods then most pretty much just skate

263
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,939

swim - or just fly the thoughts was a

287
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:24,558
rosin master as the rosin teenage ones

288
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,740
are the thoughts that keep you up at

289
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:30,140
night

290
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:34,459
yeah I mean obviously they can breathe

291
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:37,879
in outer space but so that yeah of

292
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:41,778
course they can swim in cool BAM there's

293
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:45,380
the second press meat usually makes it a
