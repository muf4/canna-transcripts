1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:08,089
[Music]

2
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:24,118
[Music]

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,480
so I'm here today because what keeps me

4
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,000
in this industry is that no parent

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,159
should have to worry about administering

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,799
medicine to their SI child or get in a

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,199
car and have a fear of going from their

8
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,640
legal grow to the legal dispensary but

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,120
getting arrested along the way the laws

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,239
here have to change um California I

11
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,640
worked here for 10 years I got out of

12
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,119
about 4 years ago and became a

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,320
consultant kind of Nationwide and in

14
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:54,038
Canada um I really fell in love with

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,359
building facilities so I've kind of done

16
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,480
it all ran

17
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,198
dispensaries uh cultivated for 10 years

18
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,119
uh but I really love the way of building

19
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:04,359
is put together and what that means so

20
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,399
that's what I'm here to talk to you guys

21
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:09,079
about tonight so it all starts from the

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,759
same place and that's the plan that's

23
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:15,959
the grow that's how it's grown and we

24
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:19,000
have an obligation as caregivers as

25
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:22,118
brand ambassadors what have you to

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,560
deliver medical grade cannabis to the

27
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,400
community at large I believe that's a

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,879
moral obligation it's an ethical

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
obligation and pretty soon it's going to

30
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:33,640
be a legal obligation so we all have to

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,320
get on page with that and the idea that

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,879
you know a lot of Growers are one

33
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:40,078
Harvest away from losing everything so

34
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,798
this means that they have to push bad

35
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,239
product onto the market a lot of the

36
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,560
times it's a big problem in this state

37
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,280
it's a problem in other states so I'm

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,840
here today to talk about cleaning up

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,840
your Grove um let's

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,759
next and so when a flower doesn't Bloom

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,359
you fix the environment in which it

42
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,640
grows not the flower so that's

43
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,920
what I focus

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,239
on this is benefits of indoor a working

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,479
with cannabis so when I started scaling

46
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,759
up into facilities that were 5,000

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,560
50,000 100,000 sare ft or more I found

48
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:19,479
large scale Egg and I thought where have

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,439
you been where is a large scale egg so

50
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:24,238
the hydro industry did something pretty

51
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,519
tricky where they renamed all these

52
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,280
things that already existed benches

53
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,879
became tables stands trays they changed

54
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,640
the vernacular so you wouldn't know what

55
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:37,840
to look for on the internet you were

56
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:41,119
paying three times the price but if for

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,360
an inferior product so once you scale up

58
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,280
to a larger facility you should never

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,080
shop at a Hydra store again I hope

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,680
there's no Hydra store owners here are

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,800
there just kidding um

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,080
so it works for

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,000
garages um so yeah much a large scale

64
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,680
EGS industrial equipment is beneficial

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,120
to streamlining the production

66
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,159
procedures of cannabis uh the

67
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,400
consistency quality assurance methods

68
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:09,560
used in large scale egg it's very

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,640
similar I hire plant scientists all the

70
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,920
time and I teach them cannabis it works

71
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,679
really really well the idea that you

72
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,759
have to be a 10year veteran grower to

73
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,439
get this is just not true it helps but

74
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,120
it's the same methodologies it's the

75
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,680
same nutrient base it is a plant it's a

76
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,759
plant that functions a million different

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,360
ways and we have thousands of different

78
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,280
strains but that's where

79
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,720
so why automation is important to indoor

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,560
cannabis uh we don't install Automation

81
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:40,840
in our facilities so that your grower

82
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,719
can become lazier and you know just kick

83
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,080
back and watch the plants grow it's so

84
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,759
he can do his job and actually look for

85
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,040
problems before they become problems so

86
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,239
if you're spending your time hand

87
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,719
watering or checking timers or doing any

88
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,799
of these things that can be done through

89
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:58,199
streamlined automation that have existed

90
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,280
in large scale a for 50 years you need

91
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,158
to check your program automation is

92
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,039
scary at first I was terrified by it but

93
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,878
it's really served me in a lot of ways

94
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,438
so from everything from SE to sale

95
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,639
software to become compliant to machines

96
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,120
that fill pots once you scale past a

97
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,519
certain size you have to automate it's

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,519
not an

99
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,120
option so the importance of R&amp;D and you

100
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,879
can't really see this um Tracy who was

101
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,280
just up here a few minutes ago I work

102
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:30,319
with her a little bit and mainly she's

103
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,638
one of my really good friends and

104
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,319
favorite people on the planet uh her

105
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,400
daughter suffers from an optic pathway

106
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:40,478
GL a tumor she's supposed to be blind uh

107
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,959
cannabis pretty much saved her vision it

108
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:45,599
saved her health overall this kid you

109
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,719
would not know is sick when you meet her

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,199
she's the happiest most joyful

111
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,000
three-year-old you've ever met in your

112
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,840
life first time I met her she jumped in

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,759
my H lap and said I love

114
00:04:53,839 --> 00:05:00,159
you and uh it's a big part of it has to

115
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,879
do with cannabis it's undeniable at this

116
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,400
point so when I think of you know an

117
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,399
8-month-old or a 90-year-old or someone

118
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,758
with a severely compromised immune

119
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,519
system we have that moral obligation

120
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,520
again to give them the best quality

121
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,879
medicine so the studies that they're

122
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:22,159
doing in Israel is basically they're

123
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,519
studying they're stripping apart the

124
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,000
plant and studying the individual canavs

125
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,918
the ones that they find most useful so I

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,120
think they have 11 of them mapped out at

127
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,918
this point

128
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,319
um and they're inputting them into rats

129
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:40,159
and what they're showing is that the way

130
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:44,120
the strain profiles are manipulated

131
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,639
through this testing it can alleviate

132
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,000
breast cancer by 100% but one won't

133
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,680
touch pancreatic cancer so I believe

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,240
within the next 5 years or so we will

135
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,840
have kind of a map of what strains work

136
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,120
best for what illnesses and they're

137
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,000
currently working on that now looking to

138
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,639
publish research that I don't even know

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,759
if I'm allowed to talk about um so they

140
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,400
do these 96 wellplay accounts where they

141
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,160
take 96 little trays and they'll put the

142
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,598
same tumor with the same genetic

143
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,840
mutations in each tray and they'll try

144
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:19,240
different strains of cannabis uh

145
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,719
different profiles of the cannabinoids

146
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,598
against these different genetic

147
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,720
mutations and some will touch it by 100%

148
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:28,800
some's 30% some's 60 so we want to know

149
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,599
what that 100% is and how we can

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,598
replicate it every time without

151
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:42,319
fail so with regulation comes

152
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:46,598
responsibility comes responsibility to

153
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,000
legality to our patients most of all I

154
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,598
think it's Patients First that is my

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,160
number one mission is to make sure

156
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,159
patients get the best medicine

157
00:06:54,279 --> 00:07:00,598
possible so we designed clean rooms uh I

158
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,038
took some server process processor HVAC

159
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:04,639
guys from Silicon Valley and I employed

160
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,240
them and said what can we do with

161
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:12,240
cannabis and so we realize that there is

162
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,280
a big disconnect between cultivators

163
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,598
construction companies Engineers we came

164
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,399
out on the market in Colorado legalized

165
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,399
and said okay you can go to 100,000

166
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,959
square ft so what did they do they

167
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,598
grabbed the guy from his garage that

168
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,279
grew the best stuff that they knew and

169
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:27,959
they grabbed the construction company in

170
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,638
town and they tried to put the two

171
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,439
together it doesn't scale that way it's

172
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,038
like trying to turn a liquor store into

173
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:38,560
a Costco it's like trying to buy a hydro

174
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:41,399
store instead of large scale app so the

175
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,199
reasons we do clean room designs is to

176
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,719
mitigate pests and pathogens from even

177
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,439
entering the facility so they don't

178
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,400
become a problem later uh to cultivate

179
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,639
medical grade cannabis of course to

180
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,959
comply with State imposed legislation

181
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:57,240
and guidelines um accurate scientific

182
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,519
studies in R&amp;D based on the best

183
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,560
material possible I don't know if you s

184
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,198
sanj gupta's weed 3 or what they're

185
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,360
studying out there in the University of

186
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,960
Mississippi but uh it's absolute trash

187
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,280
if you study trash you're going to get

188
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,560
trash results what if we study the best

189
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,959
stuff what if we study the most

190
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,519
consistent stuff what do we get then

191
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,519
that's what I'm

192
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,439
interested negative pressure this is a

193
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:27,318
big one so like 90% of the facilities

194
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:29,319
that I walk into have sewer gas because

195
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,960
we have these carbon filters that we're

196
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,240
designed for garages so that your

197
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,278
neighbor wouldn't smell your stash

198
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:41,599
growing in your garage so you have them

199
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:41,599
sucking constantly at like 1,400

200
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:46,838
cfms um so when you first put together a

201
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:49,120
building you can do some Diagnostics on

202
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,519
this and this is how we put together our

203
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,360
buildings is we do lower door test this

204
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,278
would be on a retrofit not a ground up

205
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,759
um so it measures the overall building's

206
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,679
air leakage quantifies Heating cooling

207
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,838
costs and it tests how sealed the

208
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:07,159
building's envelope is it exposes all

209
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,399
major points of air leakage there's a

210
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:12,000
lot of reasons for

211
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,519
this so let's talk about the hazards of

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,360
reverse negative

213
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,240
pressure it invites Pest and pathogens

214
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,079
into the cultivation facility so if you

215
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,159
have air sucking in you have that

216
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:23,838
reverse negative pressure going on

217
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,719
there's a lot of problems that come with

218
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,160
that so air will always travel the path

219
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,839
of lease resistance so it's going to

220
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:31,360
pull from all the most undesirable

221
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,200
places your basement your attic every

222
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,639
crack every crevice and it's always the

223
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,839
most undesirable places um it's not the

224
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:41,360
most efficient or costeffective way to

225
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,040
control an

226
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,800
environment especially when you're

227
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,000
trying to save money in price per pound

228
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,120
is so

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,440
important um and the last is it can pull

230
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,519
SE gases into the room through dried out

231
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,440
P traps so those air filters will always

232
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,360
dry out the P traps so unless you have a

233
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,320
trap primer or you've thought about that

234
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,278
before 90% % of the facilities I walk

235
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,879
into I walk up to the floor drain and I

236
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,759
can always feel that air hit my hand and

237
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,958
I know those people have breathing sewer

238
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,958
gas very bad

239
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,078
problem this is another one um so this

240
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,278
came from you know cultivating in your

241
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:21,838
garage and you just throw every hose

242
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,240
into whatever drain you have well unless

243
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,279
there's an air gap in that hose it's

244
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,039
going to grow bacteria and this comes

245
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:30,679
from condensate lines of air

246
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:33,278
conditioners sorry to get so technical

247
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:35,679
um so the condensate lines from air

248
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,838
conditioners if there's no air gap it'll

249
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,838
actually grow molden bacteria straight

250
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,160
into your head unit and distribute it

251
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,160
throughout your room facility what have

252
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,440
you uh biological contaminants so this

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,559
caused from Dirty HB

254
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,920
systems uh microbes Legionella this is a

255
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:59,039
big one so Legionnaire's Disease was

256
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,559
caused uh came from Legionella uh it's a

257
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,078
water board bacterium it's detected in

258
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,759
cooling tower water but it can also grow

259
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:10,199
through that condensate line as

260
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,838
well cladosporium is a common of

261
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,720
Outdoors this is also when you get that

262
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,920
mold smell in your air conditioner

263
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,920
that's

264
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,200
cladosporium this is another one I'll

265
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,679
just F through uh endotoxin a cell wall

266
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,959
component of gr negative bacteria this

267
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,638
is a really bad one uh known for

268
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,958
respiratory problems and all kinds of

269
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,959
things

270
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,679
so controlling HVAC

271
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,480
biocontamination uh upgraded fil

272
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:41,319
filtration efficiency of overall system

273
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,839
maintain proper filter changes proper

274
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,079
maintenance and cleaning of cooling

275
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,639
coils drainage pan should be added to

276
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:48,919
all of your

277
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,879
Sops uh design the system with the

278
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:53,799
Airstream so it doesn't come in contact

279
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:57,039
with that internal porous uh system in

280
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:59,359
the aack in your uh your head units

281
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,199
because that actually breeds some people

282
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,480
don't know this but your best form of

283
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,720
integrated Pest Management is a good

284
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,159
environmental system people will treat

285
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,040
oh I'm putting florite mid and all this

286
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,078
stuff and they keep coming back they're

287
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:15,360
breeding in your agac system nine times

288
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:15,359
out of

289
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:24,120
10 uh so reduced surface area and all

290
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:26,359
particulate matter so particulate matter

291
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,360
the best way to describe it is anytime

292
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,120
there's a lot of particulate matter Pest

293
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,000
and pathogen have something to Clan to

294
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,159
this is an example of that so all this

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,399
crazy duct work up here that's totally

296
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,319
excessive and unnecessary should be

297
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,240
recessed and these registers should

298
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,278
Point down and be blocked out with

299
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,000
drywall if you have a bunch of this duct

300
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,360
work running through your system you're

301
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,320
going to have to get up there and clean

302
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,079
it every few months all of it and it

303
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,079
just creates more surface area more

304
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,198
problem remove all exposed wood from the

305
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:59,599
cultivation facility wood is not your

306
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:01,519
friend

307
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,920
um you want to replace everything with

308
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,720
metal or Unistrut you should never use

309
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,639
wood in a cultivation facility it breeds

310
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,160
mold breeds bacteria bre

311
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,639
pathogens you can use antimicrobial

312
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,439
paint too if you already have it in

313
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,440
there there's also wine barrel paint

314
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,440
that works really well

315
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:23,799
um uh so this is a system that my

316
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,440
company kind of invented to streamline

317
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:29,078
processes because back when we were

318
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,680
using the HPS lights they have to be a

319
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:33,919
foot and a half to 3 ft away from the

320
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:36,000
top of the canopy at all time um well we

321
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,078
thought it takes way too long to move

322
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,480
these lights so we invented this system

323
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,359
where with the touch of a button you can

324
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,159
move the lights um and we have these

325
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,079
rows up to like 60 80 ft or 60 lights or

326
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,198
80 lights in length we can make them as

327
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,000
long as possible and you can move the

328
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,799
whole row streamline very simple you

329
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,720
don't have employees standing on ladders

330
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:01,559
trying to move things um just works

331
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,560
really well so that's part of

332
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,879
automation uh irrigation is a big one

333
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:10,159
this is a facility in Richmond I think

334
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:14,600
Oakland um so this is a top feed

335
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:16,159
fertigation or top feed uh doser system

336
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,440
and

337
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:22,480
uh it was basically all locked in place

338
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,600
so we had to add these OCTA bubblers on

339
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,680
each line so that it blew oxygen through

340
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,959
the line so it's less likely to

341
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,559
clog you have a lot of options when it

342
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,719
comes to irrigation basically depends

343
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,198
what size your facility is uh cone

344
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,320
bottom reservoirs Pros or you know you

345
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:40,799
can be Zone to multiple different

346
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,440
areas uh controls the ability to

347
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:47,399
irrigate mix and drain

348
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,199
um I can't read the next one but the

349
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,360
cons are it's difficult to clean you're

350
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,078
focusing on human error and uh I'm not a

351
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,199
fan of leaving it up to here in error

352
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:00,679
I'd much rather blame the

353
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,679
machine but we build

354
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,679
these um okay so these are dener systems

355
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,559
this is kind of when you step up and you

356
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,239
don't want big bulky reservoirs in the

357
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,000
room you want line fed irrigation

358
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,320
they've been used a large scale egg

359
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
forever um we've kind of integrated them

360
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,839
into cannabis and they have some cool

361
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,039
fail safes and user alerts that tell you

362
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,519
anytime your set points are

363
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:27,000
off uh fertigation this would be like

364
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:30,679
your priva or Argus Big Boy system when

365
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,440
you you know have to feed 64 different

366
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:35,239
this goes up to yeah it feeds up to 64

367
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,920
different nutrient regimens so if you

368
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,198
have a Perpetual Harvest or you're on an

369
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,759
assembly line type circuit you would

370
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:46,000
have to have one of these systems uh the

371
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:48,560
cons are The Upfront cost that's about

372
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,679
it uh but they are scalable they do come

373
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,278
in smaller models and you can scale up

374
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:56,278
but I'm a big fan of

375
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:59,278
those oh this is uh the biggest facility

376
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,039
that we've designed to date this is in

377
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,559
Nova Scotia and they're held up in

378
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,719
licensing process so they're like 80%

379
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:08,399
built out right now um but yeah it

380
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,199
basically functions like a clean room

381
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,720
facility usually it's a clearer picture

382
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:15,639
but you enter on the side all these are

383
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,519
different hallways so cultivation team

384
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,039
has their own hallway processing team

385
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,720
has their own hallway uh ancillary

386
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:23,679
management has their own hallway so

387
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,440
there's no cross contamination everybody

388
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,638
has to shower before they go into the

389
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,839
facility put on a pocketless gown and

390
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,360
walk into the facility because Canada uh

391
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,959
when we first designed this they

392
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,639
proposed no pesticides organic or

393
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,359
non-organic so we had to design it in

394
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,079
this fashion so that we would never have

395
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,199
a problem because we couldn't use

396
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,479
pesticides they also have third party

397
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,559
Auditors propos that would come to your

398
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,720
facility pick the sample they want if

399
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:54,000
that doesn't pass testing there's an

400
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,839
on-site incinerator where everything

401
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,480
goes

402
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,360
yeah

403
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,879
so so those are the standards we build

404
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,360
to I don't like using pesticides so I

405
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,160
design so I don't have to use them I had

406
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,759
one facility that functioned for seven

407
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,480
years without a single introduction of

408
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:14,759
the pestop pathogen so I know it can be

409
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,759
done it's just a lot more

410
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:18,318
work

411
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:23,178
[Applause]

412
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:29,038
[Music]

413
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:32,120
question so as a consum as a

414
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,879
consumer how do you know that what

415
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:38,038
you're buying doesn't have pathogens and

416
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,200
Myro in California you don't and in

417
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:43,240
Colorado you still don't any state that

418
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,319
can pick their own sample out of a batch

419
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,720
and go okay this looks good and send

420
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:51,038
that in for testing you're really not

421
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,558
going to know um unfortunately so that's

422
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,720
kind of my fight and that's why I get up

423
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:58,119
and speak because I do push for the

424
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,360
third party Auditors I I'm a big fan of

425
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:03,639
reg ulation I'm a big fan of compliance

426
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,158
and I want to know that anything that is

427
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,600
grown and giving to Tracy's daughter or

428
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:12,000
my grandmother who stage four is going

429
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,759
to be helping them and not hurting them

430
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,240
so hopefully they'll be some kind

431
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:20,000
of eventually I hope so I mean when I

432
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:23,480
started 14 years ago none of this was

433
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,720
happening and in the last four years or

434
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,839
so I feel like we're moving at lightning

435
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,200
speed so my hope is that sooner than

436
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,678
later it will be implemented and if any

437
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,600
I have anything to do about it on my

438
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:38,480
soap box then

439
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:41,558
hopefully here we go

440
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,440
yes you work with a lot of businesses

441
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:47,839
that are scaling up what you find is the

442
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,798
biggest challenge for the company owner

443
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,599
the business

444
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:55,440
own um there's multiple challenges and

445
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:58,599
with everybody every individual client

446
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,200
it's different it could be scalability

447
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:03,319
it could be budget it could be the team

448
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,759
already in place it could be a failing

449
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,960
facility so I I don't think there's one

450
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,079
universal answer for that question there

451
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,880
there are

452
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:14,960
multiple um you know

453
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,120
challenges I think the biggest one we

454
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,480
face is budget so when we come from this

455
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,439
kind of garage mentality and you try to

456
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,159
convince somebody to scale up and that

457
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,558
they need to basically create a food

458
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,200
processing center it doesn't register

459
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:30,240
they like oh but I built this for 20

460
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,240
grand like no

461
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:42,279
what is that Nova scoti facility cost

462
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,079
generally $34 million to date and

463
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,399
probably going to be more than that but

464
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,399
they've been and what's the um what's

465
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,159
the payback what's the investment how

466
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,720
many years it's going to take

467
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,559
to I can tell you that it pays back

468
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,919
faster than any other business I've seen

469
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:01,158
But in Canada's case can't give you a

470
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,759
number but in Canada's case they've been

471
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,720
held up so so these guys took a risk a

472
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,720
big risk and they put a lot of money

473
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,319
they sent everybody buil out build out

474
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,759
letters said go ahead build out your

475
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:14,519
facility it's okay and then you know a

476
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,240
year into the building process they said

477
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,918
stop everything we're not legalizing and

478
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,400
everybody's been sitting in line ever

479
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:25,440
since so we had to drop hammers you know

480
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,640
two a year and a half ago

481
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,038
now do you need Pharma to fund this or

482
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:35,280
do you need Farmers to fund

483
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:37,839
this do you need Pharma to come in and

484
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,759
start funding these B facilities no no

485
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,480
no that's legislation it's not about

486
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,879
funding they're well funded but they

487
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,440
don't they are not P they said go ahead

488
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,760
start the process then they pulled

489
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,720
everything back and now they're not it's

490
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:54,759
just held up it will get pasted it's

491
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,759
kind of a too big to fail scenario but

492
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,720
yeah hi hello

493
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:04,558
um I have more of a technical question

494
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,240
um in your clean rooms have you ever

495
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:10,079
brought a technology called Aros

496
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,919
sign into the into the clean rooms it

497
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,839
was a technology developed by Nas

498
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:19,200
supposedly for do you work for Aros I do

499
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,319
not I do the same thing you do actually

500
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,600
and I I was curious about the technology

501
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:27,439
I've heard things good things about it

502
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:29,558
supposed develop like space station are

503
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,919
those the they're like little glass

504
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:35,720
tubes that it passes through in the

505
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,600
byproducts radium or something like that

506
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,600
it's similar to

507
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:46,679
Fed to destroy

508
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:49,679
EOL longer but supposedly it's good for

509
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,679
killing pathogens and fungus yeah

510
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,000
there's a lot of new products out there

511
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,400
I'm not familiar with that company

512
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,278
there's a lot of so the NASA born

513
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,798
technology is typically five cell and

514
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:01,880
all it all comes from the same house

515
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:04,038
that's negatively charged ions that bond

516
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,120
to positively charged ions that are 100

517
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:07,759
times heavier than gravity so it'll kind

518
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,278
of grab anything in the air that's an

519
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,440
Airborne particulate like a a powdery

520
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:14,200
mildew and it'll drag it to the ground

521
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,840
so it doesn't eliminate it but it's like

522
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,840
a magnet that goes around and Care uh

523
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:20,918
magnetizes the Airborne particulates and

524
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,240
drags them to the ground I think that's

525
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,840
the same

526
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,319
technology yeah we do we do use it and

527
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:33,079
it's phenomenal okay good yeah m

528
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:33,079
okay thank you yes you're welcome good

529
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,798
job all right hard to see over

530
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,720
here I was wondering about your um you

531
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:49,918
said a lot of the cleaning with the air

532
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,079
conditioning um during the season how do

533
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,000
you fluctuate the air when it gets

534
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,480
hotter what is what is the best method

535
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,079
you have uh and when do you run your

536
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,240
life like if you're running your life

537
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,278
obviously at night when it's cooler the

538
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,319
air you're pulling in um how much air

539
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:10,359
conditioning you would need is it an

540
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:12,678
outdoor system that you so yeah unfor

541
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:14,759
how do you the temp with with bugs and

542
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,400
mold it also has a lot of temperature

543
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,359
right so it all depends if we're

544
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,759
designing a facility in Nova Scotia or

545
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,038
our new one in Hawaii like it all

546
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,759
depends on that environment so it's not

547
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:28,440
going to be the same environment so when

548
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,400
we do our uh en enironmental

549
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,240
calculations we take everything into

550
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,038
account we take in your longitude your

551
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,599
latitude your record highs your record

552
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:38,038
lows the insulative value of your

553
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,480
windows the depth of your slab without

554
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:41,359
getting too Technical and boring

555
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,679
everyone in the room there's too many

556
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,278
parameters for one single answer it's

557
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,679
just that every building is different so

558
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:50,519
to keep the the best way to keep fuel

559
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,679
efficiency so you're not having to run

560
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:56,480
your air all the time and keep your

561
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:58,840
temperature tostain like at the right

562
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,759
temperature each

563
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:03,240
you're yeah so there's a program called

564
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:06,038
right soft it's kind of like CAD for

565
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,759
hbac and you can plug in all those

566
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,720
values into it and it'll spit out those

567
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:12,919
uh those numbers your R values and

568
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,319
everything involved if you normally run

569
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:19,200
your like at night or do you day it

570
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:21,399
depends on the facility sometimes you

571
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,080
have to be on a flip because you're on

572
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,679
you know some kind of power grid

573
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:27,278
situation where you don't have enough

574
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:29,159
power so you have to run one 12 and 12

575
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,519
and another 12 and

576
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:35,480
12 there's no real way to know how to

577
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:38,599
keep your temperature the same in the

578
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,880
season well Seasons I mean indoors you

579
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:43,359
create your own Seasons so that's what

580
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,919
but you're pulling air from outside your

581
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,839
air changes per hour yes are pulled from

582
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,880
outside so that would hot outside you're

583
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,918
pulling hot right so you would have to

584
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,960
engineer your entire building and that's

585
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,919
why I hire clean room experts from

586
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,360
Silicon Valley to engineer each building

587
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,320
individually and put the parameters and

588
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,959
set points based on their environment

589
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:05,240
based on their

590
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,079
structure I was also wondering if there

591
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,919
any interning possibilities with these

592
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,839
facilities what's that interning

593
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,759
possibilities for these facilities we

594
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:17,119
are looking into that yeah um I'm

595
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:20,640
currently leaving the Hawaii for 3

596
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:22,918
months so after that time

597
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,200
possibly okay we got time for one more

598
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,200
which is going to be right here all

599
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,480
right so um my name is hello um I want

600
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,798
to know

601
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,480
how I want to know how uh your industry

602
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:38,038
could help the edible

603
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,640
industry it all starts with the plant I

604
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,398
know ites how how could your industry

605
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,038
help

606
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:50,119
the CH personal how could you help

607
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,240
me by producing clean consistent

608
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:56,479
products year round I understand that

609
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:59,480
how would I get what you do to me um so

610
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,200
I am just starting to work in California

611
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,079
again after the 4year stint when they

612
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,720
passed the new legislation I actually

613
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,558
came back from an 8-month stint in

614
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,640
Chicago we're working on some

615
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:12,240
manufacturing facilities here out in the

616
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,038
desert and some other places that but

617
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,359
it's probably theoretically California

618
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,798
for me for our company is like a year

619
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,558
out and the other question is so what

620
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:23,639
you're saying is the paraphrase what you

621
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:26,319
were referring to are you saying that

622
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,080
there's no such thing I stretching I

623
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,398
understand are you saying there's no

624
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:34,119
such thing as organic there's no such

625
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:38,199
thing as um a lack a total lack of

626
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:41,239
pesticides that is every road or some

627
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,278
until something like this is the

628
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,359
norm yes and no there there are some

629
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:47,798
responsible cultivators out there that I

630
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:49,759
have to give credit to that do

631
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:52,158
everything the right way my brother is

632
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,119
an organic farmer in mesino county and

633
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,039
he will cut down and throw away

634
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,719
everything before he puts a pesticide on

635
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:04,558
it there are those people have to

636
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:08,440
[Applause]

637
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:11,879
commend okay we're done

638
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,880
question thank you

639
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,159
guys
