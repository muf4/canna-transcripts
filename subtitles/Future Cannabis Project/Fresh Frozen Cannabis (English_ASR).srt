2
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,719
one thing you know I talked about

3
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:19,489
besides you catching up with a few other

4
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,079
growers this morning the law were

5
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:24,288
talking about winterization and fresh

6
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:25,788
frozen so how much I mean you don't have

7
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:27,650
to tell us exactly how many pounds

8
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:29,300
you're pushing yeah but even just a

9
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:31,159
percentage if that's something you're

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,378
getting into and and how much of it are

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,469
you allocating to essentially for lack

12
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:38,750
of better term diversify your portfolio

13
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:41,510
totally so I mean we have 50,000 square

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,670
feet of outdoor I would say this is the

15
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,869
kind of the first year that I'm actually

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,070
allocating a good amount of a to fresh

17
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:48,259
frozen just kind of seeing where the

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,230
markets evolved on the scale of

19
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:53,659
production where we're at limitations on

20
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:55,308
where we can dry it so getting into that

21
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:58,159
fresh frozen which means we just take

22
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:59,780
the plant fresh bucket down clean it up

23
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,979
a little bit and freeze it right away

24
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,070
straight to the fre straight to the

25
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:05,899
freezer and that's where the extract

26
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,548
artists these days are that's where they

27
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,000
get the most high-end product that's

28
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:13,610
Tyson to live rosin rosin indoor live

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,040
resins you have the live rosin which is

30
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:18,799
the organic kind of bubble hash

31
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,180
extraction and then pressing it and I'll

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,400
get you the live rosin and then the

33
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,659
other side of it is the live resin which

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,469
guys are pushing the fresh frozen

35
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:29,450
material through BHO gotcha and then and

36
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:31,188
then just creates a different product

37
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,140
yeah well together right totally

38
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:35,599
different cuz I actually this year just

39
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,739
as an experiment gave the same crop same

40
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,839
thing you know same everything same

41
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:43,728
greenhouse to a BHO live resin just

42
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,790
manufacture and a live rosin and the

43
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:48,739
product is so different if I didn't know

44
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,750
they were grown even the same strain

45
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:52,640
really it's just such a difference in

46
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,069
the way it comes out and we might even

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,989
see that amongst extractors as well

48
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:58,519
because the different techniques so

49
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:00,500
that's kind of fun and cool it's just to

50
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,209
see the differences of like your raw

51
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
material because when you drive the

52
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:05,538
flower it's gonna be the dried flower

53
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,379
the extract brings this whole other

54
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:11,560
element to

55
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:13,150
come to our party so I think a Frenchie

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,150
cannoli I know he's really come up on

57
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,960
the scene lately and there's there's

58
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,110
individuals like him around the world

59
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,270
but it really is an art that's one thing

60
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,130
you know as crazy as Frenchie can be I

61
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,290
love that he really puts that emphasis

62
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:28,359
that it is in art when he's doing bubble

63
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:29,469
hash yeah you know and it is a totally

64
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,610
different experience for them and that's

65
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:32,889
the only thing it takes different

66
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,650
infrastructure so you gotta have freezer

67
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:37,419
rooms ways to transport that and then

68
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,189
what if a freezer goes down and you know

69
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:41,530
200 pounds of material in there you

70
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:42,669
gotta have a backup in place like so

71
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,289
there's a lot of things it's a lot of

72
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:47,139
lot to think about a lot of moving parts

73
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:49,299
I probably prefer I wish I could just

74
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:51,789
dry at all traditionally and and do that

75
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,100
but it's fun to evolve with the market

76
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:56,379
and see new products come out and be a

77
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,180
part of all that so just got to adapt

78
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:00,490
and do a little bit everything so

79
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,900
overall I'd say probably you know we

80
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,760
focused on trying to keep the tops of

81
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,670
the plants for a flower the best stuff

82
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,169
of the best and then focus on the lower

83
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:09,399
and it also helps with the harvest time

84
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:11,769
because we can get all those tops that

85
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,319
are more susceptible to mold or botrytis

86
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,640
get them hanging and dry in gives us

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,949
some more time to deal with like the

88
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:19,419
lower but still good quality yeah you

89
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:25,869
know as a grower I always smoke the

90
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:27,099
smalls I don't the biggest artichokes

91
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,110
aren't always the most flavorful it's

92
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:31,090
funny how that transcends so many things

93
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,830
or even like yeah lobsters shrimp and

94
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,479
there are so many things it's your point

95
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,550
quality over quantity right so it allows

96
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:40,629
us to to time out

97
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:45,489
she says big hands you know you're the

98
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:47,500
one I'm like is that from a song yeah so

99
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,330
it allows us to time out the harvest a

100
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,709
little bit yeah and so I'd say we're

101
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:55,989
doing about 25% fresh frozen this year

102
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:59,699
pretty fair amount for a 50,000 square

103
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:03,430
foot canopy yeah that's that's why I got

104
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:06,099
420 square feet of freezer space this

105
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,800
week there are there are supposedly some

106
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:10,239
companies coming up that are that are

107
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,550
manufacturing companies that rely on

108
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,989
that fresh frozen material I haven't

109
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,389
personally run into a company that's

110
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,939
sending troops up to do that work for us

111
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,930
I am working with one of the the biggest

112
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:21,310
brands and

113
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,329
in the space right now in the industry

114
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:27,910
and they're about to launch if they

115
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:29,620
haven't launched it yet a live rosin

116
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,780
brand and I can guess who that is I

117
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,418
think they're based out of justjust not

118
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:38,228
too far from here actually based in here

119
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:40,930
in Humboldt yeah and so we're gonna be

120
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:46,689
one of their their main three producers

121
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:48,370
for their fresh frozen line nice I mean

122
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:50,228
I think it's probably open now is they

123
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,870
have an Instagram up so I think that's

124
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:55,810
all good but pop in Barkley's is

125
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:59,610
introducing a live one brand brand so

126
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,610
it's gonna be Papas Papas select

127
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:08,409
