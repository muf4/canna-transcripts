1
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:15,138
over the last year I like many of you

2
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:17,268
have been dealing with a new thing in

3
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:20,000
this industry I've been I've been in

4
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:23,118
this game for 12 years I've done

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,320
everything from trimming bud to being a

6
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:29,809
mule to packing flowers from humble to

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,490
Los Angeles and it's been a a really

8
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:33,679
remarkable journey I've learned a lot

9
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:36,320
but now we're getting into something

10
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:39,710
that I know very little of and that's

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,409
keeping paper records and complying with

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,539
state law so it's a new world we're

13
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:47,198
entering in and it's probably the most

14
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:49,820
difficult part of my business today is

15
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:51,619
figuring out not only how to be

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,500
compliant today but where is this all

17
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:57,049
going and so on the stage with me today

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,289
is Sherwin Omron at the end

19
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:03,409
Chicago based ethos manufacturing he's

20
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:05,659
the chief technical officer in the

21
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:08,450
middle is Brett Pritchard he's here in

22
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:10,219
California he's part of the owner of

23
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,859
results matters group a consulting firm

24
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:15,980
that's been getting not only myself but

25
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:19,840
many many many cannabis companies in

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:22,850
California compliant and Andy spoone

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,170

labs was started to help companies

63
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,789

development processes to meet regulatory

65
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:54,259
demands and stay compliant Andy's focus

66
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,090
is helping ally in fast pace innovative

67
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:58,549
teams with regulatory frameworks and

68
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:04,759
quality systems and again just so I

69
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:06,170
don't screw up the Brett Prichard

70
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,699
founder of results matters group a

71
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,199
cannabis consultant that includes

72
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:11,389
project management for the application

73
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,310
process build-out business consulting

74
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:15,409
budgeting and compliance so that's the

75
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,659
real theme here today is is compliance

76
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:19,909
how do we get compliant how do we stay

77
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,560
ahead of that curve a lot of people

78
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,449
think that federal regulation is coming

79
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,000
down the line fairly quickly

80
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:28,219
what is the FDA going to say about CVD

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,520
consumption what is the FDA going to say

82
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:33,530
about smoking psychoactive compounds

83
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,300
none of us know so it's a it's an

84
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,830
interesting Avenue if you're looking at

85
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,260
longevity for your cannabis based

86
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,300
business you need to start focusing on

87
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:43,189
compliance today you need to start

88
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,050
looking at the regulatory landscape and

89
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:47,449
seeing where your business fits into

90
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:51,380
that into that model so we're gonna

91
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:52,759
start it out and based on your

92
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:57,829
experience I'm gonna start with Andy

93
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:59,989
what have you seen and based on your

94
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,959
experience what have where do you think

95
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:06,140
cannabis is going on a federal landscape

96
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,330
oh just a quick question just to get a

97
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:12,109
show of hands so how many in here own or

98
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:13,820
work with a cannabis company okay and

99
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,310
how many of you are those with your

100
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,120
hands raised are directly involved with

101
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,750
compliance

102
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,810
it's at those companies so cool pretty

103
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,329
good number so you know our perspective

104
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,740
from coming from the FDA space is we see

105
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:31,189
this being treated just like every other

106
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,990
pharmaceutical you know we're our goal

107
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:35,779
and working with companies like Travis

108
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,150
and producing cannabis based projects we

109
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:39,799
assume that's gonna go the direction of

110
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:42,439
just the same way that you would expect

111
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,290
GLP practices GMP practices to be

112
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:48,350
applied at a company producing Advil or

113
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,650
aspirin kind of a couple of interesting

114
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,900
things about that is it it has to

115
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:57,019
balance with the pace of innovation to

116
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:59,000
the standards and compliant workflows

117
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:59,810
and processes that come into that and I

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,538
think that's one of the biggest

119
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,038
challenges in the space right now is you

120
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:07,038
know how do you continue to maintain

121
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:09,469
that agility and as you just saw in the

122
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,449
past two presentations like things are

123
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,220
moving very fast with the technology and

124
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:16,280
it's still not completely understood

125
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:19,370
what are the best ways to extract is

126
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,959
still remediated I salute so I think as

127
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,490
you want to keep that pace up you have

128
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,109
to start thinking about okay how do we

129
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,538
start putting the processes in place in

130
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,889
our company that we can you know make

131
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:30,259
sure that we're producing consistent

132
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:33,918
product a product that can be researched

133
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:36,168
tested research studied and essentially

134
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,990
be dosed and I think that's where we see

135
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:42,079
it going as a product that that's stable

136
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,500
and that dependent sure and I was gonna

137
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,079
ask you

138
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,089
or maybe Brett to start out where's

139
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:50,029
where do you see the landscape on a

140
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:53,418
state level right now and and do you see

141
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:56,209
that this is the the beginning and that

142
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:58,009
there's a long road ahead of continuing

143
00:05:56,209 --> 00:06:00,609
I know seek was coming up in California

144
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:03,050
in a year give us an overview of the

145
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,449
landscape today and and in your head

146
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,579
where it's going from here I think they

147
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:10,310
did a lot in the very beginning so I

148
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:14,329
don't think we have huge changes ahead

149
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,889
but they they have already let us know

150
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:18,769
that they will be changing it basically

151
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:22,310
every year and so they're learning from

152
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:25,218
either problems that we in the industry

153
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:28,339
run into that we then go to them and say

154
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:30,199
hey here's an issue adjust the regulator

155
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:32,810
so that we can deal with it partially

156
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,330
because of the innovation that goes on

157
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,550
and just things they didn't think about

158
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:41,029
but they're the cities and the states a

159
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,668
lot of it is around keeping track of it

160
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:45,709
from a security diversion standpoint but

161
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:47,299
also from a tax revenue standpoint and

162
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:49,668
of course the other big thing for them

163
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,560
is is the safety of the public so

164
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:55,668
there's going to be a lot there may be

165
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:59,600
more around testing or more around the

166
00:06:55,668 --> 00:07:02,049
GMP issues that we make sure that

167
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,820
everybody is producing it as a

168
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,850
consumable product so I think that's the

169
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,599
the things that will it change as time

170
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,479
goes on

171
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,240
I hope there's more kind of making

172
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:17,269
things easier but it's not going to be

173
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,620
as in getting rid of regulations it's

174
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:21,500
just going to be hopefully filling some

175
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,569
of the holes and so it's been mentioned

176
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,220
twice sure when you know there's a lot

177
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:28,099
of talk about people like oh we're gonna

178
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,190
build a GMP facility or an ISO facility

179
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,889
what does that mean well a lot of that

180
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:35,319
really means keeping track of everything

181
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:42,889
that's happening in the facilities

182
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:46,879
record record keeping it choke up on the

183
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:49,460
bat the so record-keeping process

184
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,110
tracking maintaining and mullet e to

185
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:52,699
maintain and monitor processes that's

186
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,759
really what all these systems in the end

187
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:57,469
are it's the ability to be able to look

188
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,779
backwards in time and understand what

189
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,270
happened on a production side on a

190
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:05,269
product side on a process side for

191
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:07,069
safety side energy control hazardous

192
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:09,038
materials control all these elements are

193
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,870
driven in those programs and I think as

194
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,159
those things become more formal more

195
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,689
well understood and part of the

196
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,639
conversation that ends up as part of the

197
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:18,740
conversation with the regulator's so the

198
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,960
ability to keep that data flowing

199
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,689
upwards into those regulatory bodies is

200
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,759
and maintaining that conversation

201
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:28,009
between us between the industry and the

202
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,060
regulator's that's how this regulation

203
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,848
has been involved in a productive

204
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,708
fashion it couldn't just extend that a

205
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:36,918
little bit one thing to keep in mind -

206
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:39,679
anytime you're talking about gmpgl p.i

207
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:40,848
so you're pretty much all talking about

208
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,799
the same kind of thing which

209
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,870
how do you put records in front of an

210
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,599
auditor and how do you explain what you

211
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,789
do in a repetitive way in a way that can

212
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,560
be shown that if I do this again I end

213
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:53,599
up with this same result and one

214
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:56,388
interesting thing to go back and do next

215
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,759
week going back into your company is sit

216
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:00,829
down and see how would I explain this to

217
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,180
someone who knows nothing about how I

218
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:04,359
operate and there's nothing about what

219
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:06,500
I'm doing but if I - auditors show up

220
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,879
what would I put in front of them what

221
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,198
story would I tell them and start

222
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,059
thinking about that internally and

223
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:13,338
another interesting way that happens is

224
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:14,719
with new hires I mean how many of you

225
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:17,029
are hiring people at those companies

226
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,740
like probably pretty regularly right so

227
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:20,240
you have a new hire coming in you have

228
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,889
to train them you have to tell them what

229
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,839
you do what they need to be doing on a

230
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:25,940
regular basis that's a good way to start

231
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,740
sneak peeking into what an auditor would

232
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,110
expect to see when they show up at your

233
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,560
facility and want to understand what

234
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,449
you're doing there it's a good point you

235
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,278
know we've been seeing there's there's

236
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:39,439
tons of edibles hitting the market

237
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:42,559
there's you know and and and coming from

238
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,490
you know the the California regulation

239
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:48,559
through the cbfa but when that goes to a

240
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:53,379
federal level we're making cannabis

241
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:56,088
based food products nationally you know

242
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:58,789
give me an overview of what the FDA is

243
00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:02,660
looking for the USDA is looking for when

244
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:04,610
it comes to those products so I'll kind

245
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:05,778
of speak from the FDA perspective I mean

246
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,909
that the main thing that they're going

247
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:10,698
to look for first of all is what claims

248
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:12,799
are you making as many of you know the

249
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:16,669
number one dreaded thing that pretty

250
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:19,338
much any entity making consumable drug

251
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:20,929
beverage vape is they want to make sure

252
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:23,540
that you're not claiming that it can do

253
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:25,250
something that hasn't been proven can be

254
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:27,139
done in other research studies that have

255
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,860
went through an FDA approval process and

256
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:33,860
I show of hands if you're undergoing an

257
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:38,028
FDA approved process in your development

258
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,350
right now so no one right so that's a

259
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:40,789
thing you don't want to be producing

260
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,949
edibles right now that you're claiming

261
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:48,438
can cure Alzheimer's or you know there's

262
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:49,759
a awesome series of talks right next

263
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:52,519
door right that are showing that there's

264
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,110
research being done to make those claims

265
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,450
but it's not there yet and

266
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,919
only one drug has actually went through

267
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,810
that process which was kind of a

268
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,059
double-edge short it was good in the

269
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,768
sense that you now can see that there's

270
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:05,899
drugs being proven that the FDA is

271
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:08,570
accepting our THC derivatives that can

272
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:11,450
be used to treat things but now that THC

273
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,190
is a recognized drug by the FDA for that

274
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,019
treatment of that specific thing they're

275
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,690
gonna be super sensitive to you claiming

276
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,370
it can be done for other things see the

277
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,339
cantilever warning letter that went out

278
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:25,089
this week so they claimed that there

279
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:28,399
topicals or things could treat anxiety

280
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:30,290
sleep depression a number of things and

281
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,850
so they got a warning letter saying you

282
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,259
can't make these claims and and that

283
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,490
could potentially slow down the

284
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,929
development of that product pretty

285
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,990
significantly and how it goes on the

286
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:40,099
shelves at CVS or Target or you know

287
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,110
where they're trying to put that

288
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,459
consumer based product in front of so

289
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,740
that's that's the first thing I would

290
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:47,778
say from an FDA perspective is be very

291
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,419
careful in your marketing material what

292
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:54,379
you are claiming publicly your your drug

293
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:55,578
can be done next going beyond that so

294
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:58,039
let's say I'm now starting to prepare

295
00:11:55,578 --> 00:12:00,169
something i doing expect to engage the

296
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:01,669
FDA on it goes back to what you know

297
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:03,620
Bret and Shawn were saying I need to

298
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:05,389
start keeping records I need to start

299
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,909
keeping records of how am i producing it

300
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:09,500
who my suppliers are what technology do

301
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:12,110
I have in here how is it being operated

302
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,399
there's just a whole set of series of

303
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,709
things that you're gonna expect to show

304
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,528
from a you know auditor perspective

305
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,939
coming in to that facility one of the

306
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:23,360
really interesting things about that is

307
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,730
that record-keeping that processing it

308
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,220
that doesn't necessarily mean having a

309
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,079
perfect record or not having any

310
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,730
mistakes or any errors when those

311
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,259
auditors come in they're gonna expect to

312
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,589
see the things that went wrong and what

313
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,578
was done to address those things and

314
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,170
oftentimes companies will go through a

315
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:41,539
scaling process where they're

316
00:12:39,169 --> 00:12:43,578
implementing ISO like processes and

317
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:46,069
everything's 100% compliant that's

318
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:47,750
actually a huge red flag of a process

319
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,370
that's not properly implemented because

320
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,259
it's not actually capturing the things

321
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,778
that are the improvement cycles that are

322
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:55,189
occurring in the facilities yeah there's

323
00:12:53,778 --> 00:12:56,689
a little joke in the industry like if

324
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,490
you have auditors coming in and their

325
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,470
job is to go through and find things

326
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,209
that you're doing wrong like you

327
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,920
probably want to know where those things

328
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,689
are that you expect them to find so you

329
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,219
can act surprised and be like oh I

330
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,259
didn't expect to see that

331
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,519
you know when they find it and it helps

332
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:12,019
them feel like you know they're actually

333
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,000
doing their diligence but at the same

334
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,399
time their areas that you know that you

335
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,990
had some you know kind of soft or weak

336
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,990
spots or areas where you potentially

337
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,730
weren't following your processes but one

338
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:27,379
on the stage that I work a lot with

339
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,149
Clark new part LLP and don't use that as

340
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:32,810
your philosophy on your cannabis

341
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:34,730
compliance please because that they they

342
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:37,338
are looking for something and they may

343
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:40,810
find something but don't don't give them

344
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:44,269
something to find and going back to

345
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:46,758
products and processes it's remember

346
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:49,429
you're depending on where you are in the

347
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:52,970
chain part of your responsibility is the

348
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:56,809
due diligent is coming from so if you're

349
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:59,329
a in an extraction operation you really

350
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:01,878
need to know what's going on at the farm

351
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:05,208
where your biomass is coming from and

352
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:08,300
you can't just assume it's it's good

353
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:11,028
it's great from not only a financial

354
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:13,629
standpoint but it really could hamper

355
00:14:11,028 --> 00:14:16,039
you if you get something that's tainted

356
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:18,620
god forbid it's something that's tainted

357
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:21,528
that continues to go through the system

358
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:24,230
so also remember that wherever you are

359
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:28,759
in the chain you're kind of responsible

360
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:30,199
for where all this came from it so we in

361
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,659
my facility we talk a lot about

362
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:36,379
deviation and how it affects batching

363
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:38,778
can you can you explain why deviation is

364
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:40,909
important like downstream product

365
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:46,009
recalls happen you can go back and you

366
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:51,250
give us kind of insight into that well

367
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:54,110
any of you that open question well so

368
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,208
how it's important in terms of liability

369
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,860
how it's I mean there's a what why is it

370
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,388
important I mean if you so we have

371
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,990
consumer goods hitting the Shelf

372
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:06,709
something in general consumer goods

373
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:08,568
outside the space every space the the

374
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,969
ultimate quality is important but the

375
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:14,899
the repeatability is is more important

376
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,100
and those deviations they create

377
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:17,419
variances in

378
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,409
the products that are out there in the

379
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:23,750
market space which those exceptions

380
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:25,100
become a lot of the way that the product

381
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,139
is interpreted from a liability

382
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,850
perspective from a environmental

383
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:32,569
perspective from a health and human harm

384
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:34,070
perspective the ability to control those

385
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,200
track those respond to them to keep

386
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,730
those extremes from becoming something

387
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,490
that's in the wild and uncontrolled

388
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:43,460
that's ultimately the thing that's being

389
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:46,250
that's most important it's a reason that

390
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,259
mass-market companies often get away

391
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,470
with a solution that's 85% because

392
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:54,200
they're very reliably 85% generally

393
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,720
that's a solution that's considered a

394
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,280
less risky solution than higher quality

395
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,740
products that have a greater degree of

396
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,839
variance that's often why there are

397
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,049
unregulated agricultural operations

398
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,149
dairy operations that really run into

399
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,620
trouble despite having facilities that

400
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:12,110
are some of the best facilities in the

401
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,149
world because the lack of that

402
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,500
traceability the lack of knowledge about

403
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:17,720
when those deviations occur they

404
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,559
introduce an element of risk and risk is

405
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,940
what generally drives regulators crazy

406
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,649
yeah and just to kind of go back up a

407
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,480
little bit higher level those deviations

408
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,579
are typically opportunities seen as your

409
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,289
quality team to figure out where

410
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,250
something needs to be addressed and it

411
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,529
doesn't necessarily mean you did

412
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,580
something wrong it just may mean you did

413
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:36,589
something that wasn't documented

414
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,330
properly or there may have been a work

415
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,550
instruction that wasn't exactly aligned

416
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,190
with a new piece of technology that went

417
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:44,839
into that process so I think you know

418
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,670
you got to kind of shift that mindset of

419
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,980
thinking that okay we don't need any

420
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:50,329
deviations because deviations are red

421
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,430
flags and we don't want those on our

422
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,590
books to thinking of no that means you

423
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:57,169
have a healthy quality program in place

424
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:59,030
like you expect to be finding deviations

425
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:01,129
and you expect to be improving and this

426
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:03,259
whole model of continuous improvement is

427
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:05,299
is kind of based on that idea is that

428
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:08,539
you make mistakes you learn from them

429
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:11,149
you continue to improve that's that kind

430
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:14,420
of leads me into the technology side and

431
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,370
you've all had a chance to see a slew of

432
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,699
different operations and different

433
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:21,979
equipment and and you know someone who's

434
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,750
been been kind of growing the extraction

435
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,759
business for the last six seven years

436
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,369
you know I started out with washing

437
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,069
machines in my kitchen doing bubble hash

438
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:32,569
to

439
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:34,470
you know plant sized or factory sized

440
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:37,439
processing and a lot of that was just

441
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,960
kind of throwing in equipment that could

442
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,390
be implemented today you know and that

443
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,950
was always you know he had a we don't

444
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,600
say this anymore but we used to say

445
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,419
compliance third you know like

446
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,469
production number one and then there's

447
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,940
something in the middle and then

448
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:56,399
compliance there I think you still say

449
00:17:50,940 --> 00:18:00,659
it sometimes don't say that so from from

450
00:17:56,398 --> 00:18:02,819
a mechanical an equipment side where's

451
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:07,919
our equipment today and how does that

452
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:10,619
translate to scaled consistent product

453
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,870
being delivered in the future and and do

454
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:15,329
you see some shifts in the in the

455
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:17,009
landscape where equipment that

456
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:18,778
everyone's really comfortable using you

457
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:22,109
know short path distillation or wipe

458
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:24,630
film or or new Qi filters for isolation

459
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:27,479
or whatever it is is that is there going

460
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,000
to be a shift to move towards equipment

461
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,990
that are potentially more automated more

462
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,190
data driven more consistent in the long

463
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:40,769
run yeah I mean I think that there are

464
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,480
there's a lot of chemical processes that

465
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:43,589
are implemented in the space for a

466
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,500
variety of different extraction

467
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:49,199
mechanisms that are at best currently

468
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,210
roughly defined where the manufacturers

469
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,850
have a reasonable idea about what's

470
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,048
happening everybody's rushing to scale

471
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:58,500
to reach new heights

472
00:18:55,048 --> 00:19:01,769
that scaling is its course in a lot of

473
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,990
ways so as the processes become better

474
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:05,759
understood better to find things like

475
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,589
tracking those deviations so you learn

476
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,349
more about what how the processes evolve

477
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:12,329
over time I see that equipment being

478
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,158
we're fine to a very high degree

479
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:15,960
the other interesting thing that's

480
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:17,970
happening in the space is and it's it's

481
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,829
a consistent theme because of

482
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,889
prohibition I think in a lot of ways is

483
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:25,798
there's a lot of interesting mechanisms

484
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:27,928
know-hows technologies pieces of

485
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,569
equipment out there in other spaces that

486
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:32,700
are 60% solutions for what we're doing

487
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:34,319
the evolution of those pieces of

488
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,139
equipment from something that's a

489
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,329
water-treatment piece of equipment or an

490
00:19:37,138 --> 00:19:40,969
agricultural oil processing unit to a

491
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:42,769
cannabis processing unit

492
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,860
that's really interesting stuff and it's

493
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:47,298
a very active live evolving it's

494
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:49,339
evolving a way that other industries are

495
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:51,259
not right now it's pretty exciting stuff

496
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:54,109
and I would say also we were talking

497
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:57,048
about compliance is make make all that

498
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:59,029
work together in your company so as the

499
00:19:57,048 --> 00:20:02,418
the technical people whether it's

500
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:04,700
technical on the chemical side the the

501
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:07,030
process side or technical on the

502
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:11,269
software side make sure that all your

503
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:12,500
advances are interwoven with the people

504
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:15,048
in your organization that are

505
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,869
responsible for compliance so that you

506
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:20,210
don't kind of run past what you need to

507
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:20,928
do and you kind of have to look back and

508
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,558
say wait a minute

509
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:27,140
we quit tracking something because you

510
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,119
want to build a good foundation and keep

511
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,090
running with that and whether it's

512
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,798
people in your firm or hiring good

513
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:35,629
consultants that help you with that

514
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:37,970
but make sure that that those

515
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,880
conversations are happening kind of in

516
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,130
unison so that the compliance people

517
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,870
understand what the production people

518
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,990
are dealing with and where they're

519
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:50,168
trying to go and vice-versa that the

520
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,950
production people say yeah it's you guys

521
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:53,630
responsibility to figure out where we

522
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,179
got this from we're just gonna crank it

523
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,429
out because both people will both sides

524
00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:01,130
will suffer if they don't work together

525
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:02,659
yeah but I'm a big believer in I think

526
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,190
compliance done right will make

527
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:06,140
production better I think that's a

528
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,179
universally true if compliance is a drag

529
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,380
on production over the long run there's

530
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,090
always hiccups there's things that need

531
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,890
to be worked out but over the long run

532
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:14,658
compliant compliance done right will

533
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,309
make will improve production throughput

534
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:19,309
the economics of production everything

535
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:21,319
if you think it through it will at first

536
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:22,899
when we all saw it it was like oh my god

537
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:25,298
this is going to slow everything down

538
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:28,100
but work working with the right people

539
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:31,960
working with you know all sides together

540
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:36,048
it can be a nice flow it's not that bad

541
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,298
and it's we're now seeing a lot of the

542
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:40,190
things that were implemented and just

543
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:43,819
strict cannabis regulations actually

544
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:46,308
dovetail nicely into the GMP and ISO

545
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:48,019
stuff because if we do produce a product

546
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:51,379
that has to be recalled we need to

547
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:51,609
number one know at what point it has to

548
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,190
be

549
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:59,740
called from but also where that that

550
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:02,470
misstep took place so we can go back and

551
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,579
fix it or maybe that you know it's it's

552
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,160
just something that happened at the

553
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:08,199
final stage I've seen it where

554
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,960
everything was fine right up into the

555
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,240
very end and the packaging is what you

556
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,700
know tainted something or whether it

557
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,240
started the very beginning with with the

558
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:21,340
farm yeah I just want to make a call

559
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,740
back to it's a great kind of thread from

560
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:25,509
Dustin's presentation earlier is you

561
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,599
mentioned machines and he spoke about

562
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:30,819
open sourcing machines and sharing those

563
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,379
innovative ideas I think compliance and

564
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:33,730
your regulatory should be another great

565
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,860
place to apply some of that same

566
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,360
principle like I'd love to think that

567
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:38,949
there was a community of forum there

568
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,750
were people able to go and discuss kind

569
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,279
of this is our interpretation of the

570
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,140
regulations and how we're doing it and

571
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:46,000
how it's working for us and being able

572
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,890
to benefit the whole industry by sharing

573
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,500
those ideas of how you're addressing

574
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:53,169
those standards and regulations agree

575
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,609
and the regulators would love to be part

576
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:57,309
of that discussion and they will write

577
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:59,259
the regulations in a lot of ways driven

578
00:22:57,308 --> 00:23:01,058
by those discussions do you do you think

579
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:04,269
that's what's missing in the cannabis

580
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:08,259
space specifically that we're not seeing

581
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:11,798
enough voices speaking directly to it it

582
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:13,808
has always seemed to me that a lot of

583
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:16,389
people whose voices are being heard in

584
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:18,819
the cannabis space have no idea what

585
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,919
they're talking about so is that is is

586
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:25,049
how what's missing is that there needs

587
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:28,810
to be more true true story

588
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:33,369
it's probably a mixture it's a mixture

589
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:36,159
of too many voices that someone is

590
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:38,799
speaking loudly the squeaky wheel but

591
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,070
they don't necessarily they're not real

592
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,750
they're dressing their own issue not

593
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:46,029
something specific with the industry or

594
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,920
they're addressing it on a small scale

595
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:51,069
and we really need something that is

596
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:54,580
dealt with on a very large scale and

597
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:55,960
it's other other times it's a lot of the

598
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:58,599
people that really know a lot of stuff

599
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:02,200
sometimes stay quiet and because they're

600
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:04,209
so used to being quiet and so they're

601
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,640
not they're not bringing that stuff

602
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,890
forward and that's where whether it's

603
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,890
the political political advocacy or

604
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:14,259
working directly with regulators but

605
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:17,350
they I can tell you from talking with

606
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:19,930
them when things pop up new regulations

607
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:23,079
pop up or proposed regulations they get

608
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:25,779
tons and tons of input and I'm wondering

609
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:27,909
if it's just too much that they can't

610
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:30,910
really digest it when it's just a bunch

611
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:33,550
of noise and that's where these advocacy

612
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:35,800
groups and trade associations and things

613
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:39,009
like that if they can focus and not

614
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:40,509
focus on their own trade alone they can

615
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:43,779
focus on some of those things and help

616
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:45,670
the voices be a little louder we see an

617
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:48,789
interesting parallel not quite the same

618
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:50,800
as the cannabis but it happens somewhat

619
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:52,210
similarly in software and technology

620
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,639
development and pharmaceutical

621
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:58,450
environments so as you start shifting

622
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,340
from you know let's say 80's 90's there

623
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,110
a tech where a lot of these auditors

624
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:04,240
were writing the regulations of how to

625
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:06,519
regulate software in salt and

626
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,349
pharmaceutical development and now

627
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,670
digital health technologies that are

628
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:11,980
being put out there you can go get an

629
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:14,980
app on your iPhone that can help help

630
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:18,160
you stop smoking right to kind of help

631
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,019
the previous generation of auditors and

632
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,450
regulators that are writing regulation

633
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,970
think how to talk to the modern-day

634
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,650
software writers and software agile

635
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,019
technologies and software development

636
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,550
platforms you had to overcome a little

637
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:32,470
bit of arrogance from both sides of the

638
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:34,659
table and and I think there's a little

639
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,309
bit of that too like your auditors think

640
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,490
that they know you know everything they

641
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:39,349
wrote the standard

642
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,819
you're practicers and your developers

643
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:42,648
think that they know what's best cuz

644
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:44,839
they're able to go and and write the

645
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:46,129
best software I think you are going to

646
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:47,990
see some of that with the cannabis space

647
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,490
as well you get you got people from both

648
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,230
sides now maybe I don't know the

649
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,419
regulator's in the space it's it's

650
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,829
fairly new so you know maybe they're not

651
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,778
quite as thinking that they know

652
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:58,609
everything about it but you you do have

653
00:25:56,778 --> 00:26:01,038
to have a little bit of meet in the

654
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:02,709
middle you know kind of mentality going

655
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,750
into those conversations

656
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:08,690
shirring a conversation we had a while

657
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:11,058
back that I remember about the safety

658
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,960
and compliance of the machinery using

659
00:26:11,058 --> 00:26:17,210
and you know I know show of hands how

660
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,500
many people have used a a short path

661
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:24,610
distiller so I know many of you you know

662
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:28,069
we go on a we buy equipment from whoever

663
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:29,979
we set it up in our garage or lab or

664
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:33,019
whatever we have at that moment and we

665
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:36,230
we we start going and we learn through a

666
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:38,898
process of failing but as you scale up

667
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:42,259
we had this conversation about doing has

668
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:44,028
ops to see where our failure points are

669
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:45,648
and to see where can you touch on a

670
00:26:44,028 --> 00:26:48,829
little bit and how important that is is

671
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:52,569
being part of the the roadmap to getting

672
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:55,129
towards a compliant facility yeah so the

673
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:58,700
process management from an industrial

674
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:00,500
scale involves trying to understand from

675
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,870
a safety perspective an environmental

676
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,058
perspective a hygiene perspective and an

677
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:07,548
operability perspective what your plant

678
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:10,129
is going to do what your facility is

679
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:14,569
going to do that's a pretty involved and

680
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:17,028
detailed process it's I think it's very

681
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:19,849
valuable it fits into the whole theme of

682
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:22,369
ISO and FDA compliant but it really is

683
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:25,339
about understanding every step every nut

684
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:27,769
and bolt every pipeline every pump in

685
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:29,028
your facility and looking at it from a

686
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:30,740
couple of different dimensions of

687
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:33,259
control of energy control of heat

688
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,329
control of pressures and and things that

689
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:39,169
can interfere things that could

690
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:41,538
introduce toxins or contaminants perhaps

691
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:43,429
even benign contaminants and being able

692
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:46,849
to track and manage those things these

693
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:48,230
these processes in order to have a what

694
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:50,480
would be considered an OSHA compliant

695
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,789
facility it has to be a process itself

696
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,200
it's

697
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:53,940
not something that should be started in

698
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,000
a day or solved in a day it never

699
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,900
happens that way but it's it will be and

700
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,470
I think it's going to be a very

701
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:03,600
important factor going forward being

702
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,960
able to manage those risks means being

703
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:09,240
able to continually make progress on

704
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,069
reducing those risks otherwise I think

705
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,890
what ends up happening is facilities get

706
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:15,899
shut down you could stop work orders you

707
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,370
get more regulatory review you get

708
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,650
auditors that are coming in that then

709
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:22,259
want to run through the same process and

710
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,759
identify errors that might be made which

711
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:25,829
that leads to further work stoppages

712
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,809
it's it's a mess it's it's much better

713
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,549
and more productive to stay ahead of

714
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:32,909
that I think and you're going to end up

715
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:34,950
having to do it anyway the cities the

716
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:37,290
state requires it to a certain extent

717
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:40,140
and the cities are requiring it more and

718
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:42,680
more as you build out the facilities and

719
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,320
go through the building and safety

720
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:48,090
concept the fire development services

721
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,029
departments are getting more and more

722
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:54,449
involved and they realize that some of

723
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:57,930
these machines that we build are big and

724
00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:00,960
they involve you know pressures they

725
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,910
involve an employee safety environmental

726
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,069
all that stuff they're they're kind of

727
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:07,290
figuring out and they're gonna they're

728
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:09,450
gonna make you go through it anyway so

729
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:13,039
you might as well do it now get a handle

730
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:15,600
on it and you know liability there are

731
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:19,649
there are people lining up to sue the

732
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:21,179
cannabis industry and employee safety is

733
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,640
just going to be one of the the many

734
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,950
areas and so just like any other

735
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,920
building you would expect if you're you

736
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,900
know producing peanut butter.you if

737
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,940
you're working there you expect it to be

738
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,590
safe and you don't you know you hope

739
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,500
that the company has done everything it

740
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:39,959
can do to keep use and employee safe as

741
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,299
well as produce a safe product it's it's

742
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,660
really no different and these other you

743
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:47,970
know hamper cannabis and we just need to

744
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:51,050
recognize that and get get on board and

745
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:53,700
get your your proper people involved and

746
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:55,710
you'll be ahead of the game with a lot

747
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,440
if you're doing a lot of this quality

748
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,660
control and understanding what you're

749
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,880
the equipment that you're using that it

750
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,920
is safe for what you

751
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,650
using it for and that it's going to be

752
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,300
safe you have protocols SOPs all that

753
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,090
kind of stuff to develop a good product

754
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:14,389
and to do it well and it a lot of it and

755
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:17,359
I think from outside the industry from a

756
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,860
regulatory perspective from partner and

757
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,329
customer perspective if they were doing

758
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:23,029
due diligence on a large scale

759
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:26,449
a lot of it starts with respect for the

760
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:27,889
forces at work in the industry we deal

761
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,299
with things that are very hot and things

762
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,520
that are very cold things that are

763
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:33,039
potential asphyxiant things that can

764
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,269
catch fire things that are at

765
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,799
potentially very high pressures things

766
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:39,889
that can go boom things that can go up

767
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,299
and starting that discussion starting

768
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,670
the process the first step is is

769
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:45,079
recognizing and identifying at least the

770
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:47,090
sources of energy the hazards that are

771
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,139
out there and just understanding that

772
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:51,289
they need to be treated with respect

773
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:54,259
just getting to that point is is at

774
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:55,940
least half of the work honestly and that

775
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:57,440
and then final question before we take

776
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:03,110
some questions

777
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:07,150
you know we've seen we ate a company on

778
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:10,519
HCB over here in southeast downtown

779
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:12,650
building a pretty sizeable plant and as

780
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,410
we've had inspectors come through and

781
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:20,390
people come through that are in a

782
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:23,259
regulatory position they kind of don't

783
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:26,630
know what they're looking at and so it's

784
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:29,299
it's difficult in some ways to kind of

785
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,680
get them to process like you know cuz it

786
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:33,220
to them it looks like you know an

787
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,150
episode of Breaking Bad

788
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,980
Marya ly know what they're looking at

789
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,840
they don't know what it does how do we

790
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,910
get around that how do we educate how do

791
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:43,220
we bring those regulators into the fold

792
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,259
of like being comfortable with with what

793
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,690
we're producing I think part of it is

794
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:49,670
understanding their language what are

795
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,580
the things that they freaked out about

796
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:54,500
things that make things go boom or hurt

797
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:56,809
people and if you've already dealt with

798
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,420
all that you've documented all that then

799
00:31:56,809 --> 00:32:02,029
when they see this and they say ah okay

800
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,920
and then you can walk them through this

801
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:06,200
is the precaution we put here this is

802
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,440
designed here here's the has

803
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,750
hazard associate analysis that we've

804
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,330
done then you're speaking their language

805
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:16,789
and they're going up these people do

806
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:18,889
know what they're doing they have asked

807
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:20,480
some of the same questions I would and

808
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,340
they've already gotten the answers and

809
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,470
they've already dealt with it so that

810
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:27,349
their that their blood pressure can go

811
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,059
down a little bit and I think part of it

812
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:32,359
is as they go through these inspections

813
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:34,879
they see this the other part is I know

814
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:36,949
part of what we do is try to develop

815
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,530
relations with these people so we can

816
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,880
find out what they're looking for so

817
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:44,210
that we can talk to the clients in

818
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,250
advance but honestly in some departments

819
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:49,279
they're still trying to figure out what

820
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:51,769
they want these things to look like and

821
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,799
so it's it's looking at other industries

822
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:57,379
and saying okay when they remain you're

823
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,539
fracturing peanut butter they wanted to

824
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,700
see this this and this so let's address

825
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:03,319
those same pressures and flammability

826
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,500
all the different things that we know

827
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:07,689
they're going to freak out about some of

828
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,670
that starts with some pretty traditional

829
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:12,830
activities if you go into a peanut

830
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,420
butter plant or a steel mill or a

831
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:16,759
plastics facility it's going to start

832
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,710
with signing and start with a short

833
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:21,019
safety briefing there might even be an

834
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,700
evacuation briefing an explanation of

835
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:24,049
what you're going to see perhaps a

836
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,569
brochure that explains it on a high

837
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:28,669
level and then you know questions in a

838
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:31,939
review and a tour those are kind of the

839
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:33,820
normal steps that are expected and it's

840
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,750
it's a relatively basic stuff it's not

841
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:36,740
for most people that are involved in

842
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,869
these facilities these are pretty

843
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,940
straightforward concepts that we we've

844
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:42,469
internalized we understand if you can

845
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,380
communicate them things that you already

846
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:48,230
know pretty well on a pretty basic level

847
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,880
I think that goes a long way to being

848
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:53,150
able to show that we take these things

849
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:56,000
seriously well and the not-so-fun answer

850
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,890
is you make it boring like taking sexy

851
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,690
out of the picture I think so many times

852
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:01,880
like you come in and people are very

853
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,070
fired up to talk about why this is the

854
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,190
best you know short path because of

855
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:09,679
terpene or compound and you're obviously

856
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:12,440
a fanatic about the product where you're

857
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,119
talking to someone who wants to think

858
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,829
that you're you're creating a water

859
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,779
treatment facility like you know you're

860
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:19,519
excited about like steaming something

861
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,190
over here so I think you know

862
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:23,659
from that perspective to that it's not

863
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,849
necessarily the answer I don't think

864
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:27,710
really anybody wants to hear but it is

865
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:30,380
doing some of those boring things and

866
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:33,289
and making it a little bit more you know

867
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:36,320
that's less exciting yeah intangible

868
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:38,809
yeah and Sherman rings up an important

869
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,350
point it's you're going to get inspected

870
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:43,969
whether it's just traditional

871
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:46,750
inspections that happen to any business

872
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:49,158
or whether it's specific inspections to

873
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,840
the cannabis or hemp business you're

874
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,720
going to get inspected so I think

875
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,519
preparing for that and knowing not only

876
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,619
do we do this with every visitor that

877
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:59,000
comes in they're gonna sign in they're

878
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:01,400
gonna get safety glasses they're going

879
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,559
to get a briefing on don't touch this go

880
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,840
this way if you hear this this sound

881
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:08,119
then if we get into the habit of doing

882
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,420
that with our visitors then when our

883
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,159
inspectors come it's like okay guys gals

884
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,480
we do this with everybody that visits

885
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:20,599
the facility sign in safety glasses

886
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,789
evacuation drill then again if they say

887
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,369
these people know what they're doing and

888
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:27,800
it's a it's a little bit of taken away

889
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:30,889
the sexy but it's also taking away the

890
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,680
fear that I know sometimes when I review

891
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:35,359
things I get to review a lot of premise

892
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,039
diagrams to make sure that there are

893
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,800
compliant with city and state

894
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:42,170
regulations and sometimes I get them and

895
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,510
from you know from the front page I can

896
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,980
tell oh I got this is gonna take a lot

897
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:49,100
of time they have not really gotten

898
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:51,409
anything right and I know I sit there

899
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:53,449
and pour over literally almost every

900
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:54,889
square inch of the drawing and other

901
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:57,049
times I get them it's like okay they've

902
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:59,359
got it oh this is right they've got they

903
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:01,700
figured this out and you're your guard

904
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,860
goes down because you feel like you're

905
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:05,569
dealing with a professional that knew

906
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:09,079
what they were doing when they put this

907
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:10,760
together and you're not so feeling like

908
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:13,420
I've got to find every single thing that

909
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,920
they did wrong because they did a lot

910
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,940
gotcha I want to open up we got a few

911
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,970
more minutes if anyone has a question

912
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,159
these are three great guys to talk

913
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,329
compliance with so if you have a

914
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:27,859
question raise your hand and we'll

915
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:30,460
identify you anyone in the room right

916
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,460
there in the middle

917
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:46,559
[Music]

918
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:54,700
I'll just take a yeah yeah take a step

919
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,190
you know that is something that's

920
00:36:54,699 --> 00:37:00,849
amazing about the cannabis space we fall

921
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:03,610
under oh I'll paraphrase it yeah sorry

922
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:08,739
so what standards what regulations are

923
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:11,920
we looking at overall in AFP or is it

924
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:15,219
health and safety is it FDA is it you

925
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,470
know where do you go to to find what

926
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:20,709
standards are your you're falling under

927
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:21,959
like cover that yeah and I I think

928
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,639
that's the interesting thing about

929
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,530
cannabis specifically you know we we

930
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,949
make food products we make smokeable

931
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:32,170
products we make topical products we you

932
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:34,210
know there's so many things that fall

933
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,159
under so many different categories we

934
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:39,220
manufacture all those products and

935
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:42,129
buildings that could be you know a nice

936
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:45,069
sized boom machine for lack of a better

937
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:48,039
word so how do you kind of navigate all

938
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:50,559
those different regulatory bodies and

939
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,570
and and and make them work for you

940
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,639
well one important thing to realize too

941
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,350
is I think you you have roughly at least

942
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,659
three or four different angles of what

943
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:01,210
compliance means up on the stage here so

944
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:02,799
I think there's legal compliance which

945
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:06,220
is a lot of what Bret's talking about

946
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:09,010
your state your local hope soon to be

947
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:10,809
national regulations right that you're

948
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:14,140
required to just because you fall into a

949
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:15,699
business of cannabis right the other

950
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:17,500
piece of that is from a manufacturing

951
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:20,139
perspective right so if I'm putting in

952
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,789
an ISO 9001 quality system into my

953
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:23,710
facility there's tons of information

954
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:25,989
online of what that looks like it's a

955
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,670
pretty standard thing right and then you

956
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:29,859
start getting into you're making a food

957
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,599
you're making a consumable you're making

958
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,760
something that's going to be inhaled

959
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,650
digested that's a whole nother set of

960
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,180
things right and then as I start

961
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,880
bringing my different pieces of

962
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:41,349
equipment into that presentation you're

963
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,019
going to start engaging you know

964
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:46,929
potentially you know a fire

965
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:48,369
or some or co2 code or another code

966
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:50,230
that's from another industry or

967
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:53,079
electrical code from an electrical

968
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,940
industry so keep in mind it is a complex

969
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:56,949
topic there's there's there's probably

970
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,480
once again going back to the earlier

971
00:38:56,949 --> 00:39:00,279
comment it's one of those things that

972
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,480
would really benefit people sharing

973
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,570
information of what they're encountering

974
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,429
like this is kind of in California I'm

975
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,620
doing this I'd like to talk to other

976
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:11,399
people in my area about how they're

977
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:14,139
addressing DC or how they're addressing

978
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,760
you have fire compliance or metric

979
00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:18,099
compliance that's probably a great one

980
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,840
right there right I mean there's so many

981
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:21,369
people we talk to or saying like well I

982
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,870
know we're supposed to be doing it it's

983
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:24,549
really unclear what we're supposed to be

984
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:26,230
doing I just wish I could go talk to

985
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,600
somebody else that actually is going

986
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,820
through the same thing that's a that's a

987
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,579
big point right there if anybody sees

988
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,620
Dustin later on make sure we get a

989
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:37,509
compliance portion of that website built

990
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:39,659
before G long right there in the in the

991
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,660
right

992
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:51,800
so the question was how do people budget

993
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,650
for this activity and where do they

994
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:59,570
budget that from his era is there a

995
00:39:54,650 --> 00:40:01,760
formula is there a percentage the easy

996
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:04,730
formula is budget more than you thought

997
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,890
it would be because that's everybody has

998
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:08,780
underestimated that and I would say

999
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:11,059
treat treat it like a business you've

1000
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:15,130
got different pieces of the business so

1001
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:17,570
if you're doing you know equipment

1002
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,789
compliance and safety that's going to go

1003
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:22,160
into the you know the buying or the

1004
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:23,570
building of the equipment you're

1005
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,588
probably going to have a legal budget

1006
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,800
you're going to have a business a

1007
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:30,519
staffing budget that's more of your

1008
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,720
human brain power compliance issues and

1009
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:36,559
you know if you're producing products

1010
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:38,989
that fall into the FDA realm we've seen

1011
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,789
a lot of different facilities and I

1012
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:43,939
would say almost every single one of

1013
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:47,449
them have one if not four or five people

1014
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:50,510
that that is their only job is to know

1015
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:52,969
what the rules are to train the all the

1016
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:55,310
staff in the facility to follow those

1017
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:57,709
rules and then a team to continually

1018
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:59,989
watch to make sure that as we're doing

1019
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:02,358
it we're following the rules so it's

1020
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:05,088
really budgeting it I think falls into

1021
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:07,369
the different areas and it's all gonna

1022
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:09,828
be on the scale but generally people

1023
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:12,170
have under under budgeted that it's I'll

1024
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:14,539
just mention this it's it's a lot

1025
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:16,010
cheaper line-item if you start it at the

1026
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:19,429
beginning that if you try to bolt it on

1027
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:22,609
later retrofitting in compliance quality

1028
00:41:19,429 --> 00:41:25,969
safety these are very hard expensive

1029
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:27,619
things yeah and just one more coming on

1030
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:29,509
that which I think it just mentioning

1031
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:31,970
once again like all things compliance

1032
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,859
its risk management based right so

1033
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:36,199
assessing what are the risk I exposed

1034
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:37,759
myself to and aligning that to what the

1035
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:40,098
right dollar spend would be against it

1036
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,630
if the risk is me getting shut down and

1037
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:43,088
having a million dollars invested in

1038
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,680
this license in this facility

1039
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:47,150
evaporating out from underneath me you

1040
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,889
know you probably want to allocate a

1041
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,789
chunk of that in to protecting against

1042
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:52,329
that from happening

1043
00:41:49,789 --> 00:41:55,570
and one one real quick add-on to that

1044
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:59,170
as working with your whether it's

1045
00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:01,870
architectural GC your engineering firm

1046
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:04,630
because some of this some compliances

1047
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:06,130
flow you can make it really easy to be

1048
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,019
compliant or you can make it really

1049
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,789
difficult where people are having to go

1050
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:12,130
back and forth from one area of the

1051
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:15,610
building to the other to do what's

1052
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:17,140
what's needed so think of it from build

1053
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:19,360
a good foundation think of it from the

1054
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:22,000
very beginning and build it build it

1055
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:25,240
workable compliant good workflow

1056
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,840
efficient from the very beginning back

1057
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:27,839
there in the white t-shirt

1058
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,430
I got it yeah so the question was is

1059
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,010
there programs to start training

1060
00:42:54,429 --> 00:42:59,829
compliance officers compliance personnel

1061
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:01,570
inside of companies it you know the

1062
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:03,460
thing is this this is there's tons of

1063
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,660
them and the interesting thing is this

1064
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,579
is an industry that's kind of

1065
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:10,599
approaching compliance is not a new

1066
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:12,369
thing but as a fairly recent thing to be

1067
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,079
aware that there's a whole lot of

1068
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:16,809
training of compliance outside of

1069
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,739
cannabis that will dovetail exactly into

1070
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:20,409
what you're trying to do

1071
00:43:17,739 --> 00:43:23,469
for example USC as a regulatory affairs

1072
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:25,599
program that produces compliance and

1073
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:28,480
regulatory affairs people looking for

1074
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,769
jobs in pharma I guarantee you some of

1075
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,289
those students graduated from those

1076
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:34,000
programs are very excited to figure out

1077
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:37,090
what that looks like inside of cannabis

1078
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,250
so the those programs are out there they

1079
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,809
may not have cannabis on their name but

1080
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:42,190
there's definitely people in them that

1081
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:43,989
are very excited to get into the space

1082
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,400
and figure out what that looks like you

1083
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,689
know bringing those principles into the

1084
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:51,700
space they're tuned into that frequency

1085
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:54,220
yeah yeah so so go and blanking on the

1086
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:58,019
names but asq the American Society of

1087
00:43:54,219 --> 00:44:00,669
quality regulatory affairs societies

1088
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:03,789
international societies ISO obviously is

1089
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:06,730
a huge one all those large networks

1090
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:08,230
produce quality professionals and

1091
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,960
training programs for quality and

1092
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:12,190
compliance awesome and then right there

1093
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,059
in the black shirt and then we'll just

1094
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,059
last question right here

1095
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:46,949
so the the question ons my GC and and

1096
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,920
and the awesome question was he's

1097
00:44:46,949 --> 00:44:51,809
building out one of our facilities and

1098
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,059
from a GC general contractor

1099
00:44:51,809 --> 00:44:56,130
point-of-view things keep changing we

1100
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:57,360
keep putting new equipment in there you

1101
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,730
know the plans have to change the

1102
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,140
electrical has to get redone we're doing

1103
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,389
a lot of research and development in

1104
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:06,059
there so you know there's a facelift

1105
00:45:03,389 --> 00:45:08,789
every month or so and and and he's

1106
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:10,349
wondering is there at some point they're

1107
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,000
gonna be a stop and we're gonna say okay

1108
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:15,210
this is it this is what we're moving

1109
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,300
forward with sadly I would probably say

1110
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:19,559
no there's no stop for that I just don't

1111
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,180
think the industry's quite got there yet

1112
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,070
I think you know you're you're still

1113
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,469
figuring out what's the best technology

1114
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,850
what's the right scale I mean what is

1115
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:28,829
the right scale I mean it's interesting

1116
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:31,469
just looking at the market of extraction

1117
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:35,190
right am i extracting you know 500

1118
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:36,480
pounds 5,000 50,000 I mean all those

1119
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,980
have very different answers from a

1120
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,349
compliance perspective and you're not

1121
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,469
you know you're you're not um building a

1122
00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:44,489
restaurant that has a pretty established

1123
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:47,189
like if I know if I'm building a

1124
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:48,659
restaurant in LA this is you know how

1125
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,980
you do it this is I know who I'm going

1126
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:51,659
to talk to what inspectors are gonna

1127
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,389
come in here I don't think you've quite

1128
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:55,529
hit that that point yet in cannabis

1129
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:58,440
build-out and it's gonna be interesting

1130
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:59,820
to watch with him I I think one thing

1131
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,309
that we haven't spoken very much about

1132
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,930
yet is how hemp I think it's very

1133
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:06,210
quickly going to dovetail into this

1134
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:08,219
conversation as well and get treated the

1135
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:10,320
same way as cannabis and and help

1136
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:12,359
standardize a regulatory compliance

1137
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,920
approach across and processing both

1138
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,990
those points which is how it is in

1139
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,550
Canada right at the hemp and cannabis

1140
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:23,129
fall into the same same same legal

1141
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:25,769
regulatory framework and I think also to

1142
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:29,119
your to your question that's part of

1143
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:32,460
that getting everybody to work together

1144
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,710
because some things you want to find out

1145
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,199
I know I I kind of sometimes find it

1146
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:40,619
along the way with clients that they

1147
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:44,460
want to build this and then they want to

1148
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:46,559
build you know this times too and so

1149
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,720
it's having that conversation if you can

1150
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:53,400
because not all the time did they know

1151
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:56,759
it what is what is the scale up on this

1152
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,410
and as a result if we're putting in and

1153
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,970
I'm just I'm just making up something

1154
00:46:58,409 --> 00:47:02,849
here we're putting in something that

1155
00:46:59,969 --> 00:47:05,730
needs a 200 hundred amp circuit today

1156
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:07,679
and it's it's you know from a GC

1157
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:10,469
standpoint or an architect standpoint is

1158
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:12,719
that where we're gonna stop and a lot of

1159
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:14,189
times the owners no no that's not what

1160
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,619
we're gonna stop but we didn't ask the

1161
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:18,570
question and so then it's like no we

1162
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:21,319
would like to actually put two of those

1163
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:24,030
in that's like okay well maybe we'll run

1164
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:26,730
conduit for two or maybe we need to pull

1165
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:29,870
a different transformer off the pole and

1166
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:33,179
so it's us using what we know to help

1167
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:35,489
the clients vision what they're gonna

1168
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:38,129
have in the next you know three to five

1169
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:41,000
years versus looking at what's right in

1170
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:44,190
front of them because I also find that

1171
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,320
in in the clients might there's a

1172
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:49,349
thousand things running around in there

1173
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:53,400
and sometimes the thing that's not there

1174
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:55,920
is what we're gonna need to do to comply

1175
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,470
with the electrical you know a year from

1176
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,590
now and so it's us doing those that are

1177
00:47:58,469 --> 00:48:03,839
in the fire or electrical or plumbing or

1178
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:05,640
whatever to ask those questions and say

1179
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,740
do we need to do we need to beef it up

1180
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:10,799
for you from day one so that you can

1181
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:12,359
expand when you're ready and that's a it

1182
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,580
is a moving target I mean we saw from

1183
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:17,430
from dr. Calaway you know short path

1184
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:18,900
distillation you pump something through

1185
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:20,460
it and all of a sudden your your results

1186
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,460
come out at 75 percent total

1187
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:25,740
cannabinoids what's the other 25 percent

1188
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:27,539
you know you know it's not water you

1189
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:29,369
know it's not a solvent you've burned

1190
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:31,469
all that stuff off what's what's the

1191
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:33,839
rest and is that acceptable from a

1192
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:35,609
consumer good standpoint if someone's

1193
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:38,340
marking something on a box is 75%

1194
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:40,349
cannabinoids that means there's 25% some

1195
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,820
sort of inert material in there that

1196
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:44,309
you're not identifying whether that's a

1197
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:46,950
psychoactive material or or anything

1198
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:49,130
else so those things really haven't been

1199
00:48:46,949 --> 00:48:52,139
established yet so I see that target

1200
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,990
continuing to move as more regulations

1201
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:55,609
come on board I feel we're in the boat

1202
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:57,199
there's probably a long road of

1203
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:59,570
regulation ahead of us and it's not

1204
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:01,129
going to shorten anytime soon for

1205
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:03,760
getting you relief from that last

1206
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,760
question right here

1207
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,709
[Music]

1208
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:51,519
it's great yeah it's a great topic it's

1209
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:53,110
getting a lot of discussion in the space

1210
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:55,269
right now I think the interesting thing

1211
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,019
is FDA's mandate is to protect the

1212
00:49:55,269 --> 00:49:58,300
public health

1213
00:49:56,019 --> 00:49:59,769
right and I think that it's easy for

1214
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,269
them to look at supplements or

1215
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:02,889
nutriceuticals and say there are lower

1216
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:04,719
risks they take the same approaches

1217
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:06,400
we're encouraging you to do take it from

1218
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:10,480
a risk-based approach right so they say

1219
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:12,700
hey I can go take these vitamin D pills

1220
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,860
over here what's the risk of that what's

1221
00:50:12,699 --> 00:50:16,509
the risk of that producer being way off

1222
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,980
target of what they put in there and

1223
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,900
it's a it's a low risk and I think

1224
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,760
that's how the FDA looks at that whereas

1225
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,070
if I'm making something that I'm

1226
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,260
claiming has ability to treat pain

1227
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:28,240
relief or potentially has an addiction

1228
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,430
component or potentially has a liver

1229
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:31,989
impact they're going to see that as a

1230
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:35,199
much higher risk so I think that's going

1231
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:41,139
to depend on the you can't really steer

1232
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:43,509
it from a PR marketing kind of strategy

1233
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:44,920
you your doctors are gonna be steering

1234
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:47,170
that for you and I think if you're

1235
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,490
trying to do and reach the full

1236
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,559
potential of what you think this plant

1237
00:50:48,489 --> 00:50:54,459
can actually do I think it's gonna land

1238
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:56,230
solidly as a pharmaceutical compound as

1239
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,599
I think what's being spoken about in the

1240
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:01,480
room next door yeah and I would

1241
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:04,059
recommend just on that note talking or

1242
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,110
listening to dr. Jeff Chen who's speak

1243
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:08,469
he's speaking about the war for

1244
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:12,579
cannabinoids you know GW pharmaceutical

1245
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:13,959
put out epidemics there's an analog THC

1246
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:15,819
out there right now that's been on the

1247
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:18,490
market for more than twenty years and

1248
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:21,309
there are flags being planted in the

1249
00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:25,899
ground at the FDA as soon as the FDA by

1250
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:28,599
law approves a drug then it is no longer

1251
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,369
you you can't make it yourself you know

1252
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:32,139
you can't go out and make opioids

1253
00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:35,759
yourself because it's under the FDA's

1254
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:43,269
Burgh you has a drug so right now CBD

1255
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:45,850
CBG CBC are all under a drug under the

1256
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:47,289
FDA's regulatory approval system so what

1257
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:50,049
does that mean why is there so much talk

1258
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:51,670
about CBD and then and then limiting the

1259
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,039
market for edibles and things like that

1260
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,570
because that is already found those

1261
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:57,940
flags have Arden planted in the ground

1262
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:59,410
and then and Jeff will speak about this

1263
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,220
probably more elegantly but he'll talk

1264
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:02,108
about

1265
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:04,239
you know what do we do to prevent that

1266
00:52:02,108 --> 00:52:05,949
well there's prior science right and if

1267
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:07,659
we can start developing that prior

1268
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:10,629
science and an open-source kind of

1269
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:13,868
methodology then those patented flag in

1270
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:17,380
the ground claims can't really keep

1271
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:19,180
rolling forward but but jokingly embrace

1272
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,619
it I guess that's kind of the joking

1273
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:23,049
answer right instead of trying to fight

1274
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:24,369
it I would encourage the industry to try

1275
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:26,740
to embrace it I think that's gonna be

1276
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:28,869
your best it's been the biggest

1277
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:31,629
stumbling block and the reason for this

1278
00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:36,280
panel I've seen over the last 12 years

1279
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:38,170
and and certainly after prop 64 in 2017

1280
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:40,119
we had 30,000 cannabis businesses in

1281
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:43,030
California today we have less than

1282
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:44,740
10,000 why is that because people looked

1283
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:47,019
at this new regulatory system and like

1284
00:52:44,739 --> 00:52:49,779
these guys are trying to screw me this

1285
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:52,210
is too arduous I can't keep my business

1286
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:54,849
afloat and they don't they don't turn

1287
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:56,920
the corner but this is reality this is

1288
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:59,769
what's happening and if you want to keep

1289
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:02,380
your cannabis company moving forward

1290
00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:03,730
this is kind of what we competitive

1291
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,680
advantages I think that's ultimately

1292
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:07,838
this is leverage for you to stand out

1293
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,608
beyond your competition you embrace a

1294
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:11,440
new show that I can do these things I

1295
00:53:09,608 --> 00:53:13,809
have no problem with quality compliance

1296
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,980
like then you're on the path to become

1297
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:18,059
whether or not you want to be or not I

1298
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,740
don't throw up I know Big Pharma's not a

1299
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:23,920
good name here but you know if you want

1300
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:25,959
to be the next generation of bear or you

1301
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,490
know J&amp;J I mean that you embrace that

1302
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,769
and that's gonna help you stand above

1303
00:53:27,489 --> 00:53:31,059
the rest absolutely thank you so much

1304
00:53:29,769 --> 00:53:32,570
guys I really appreciate you how big

1305
00:53:31,059 --> 00:53:36,199
around applause

1306
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:36,199
[Applause]
