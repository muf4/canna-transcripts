2
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:17,868
I've talked to Lori Jenks before and I

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,760
was like okay well let's talk about

4
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:21,528
advertising love to help with the

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,750
regulations love to help what you're

6
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:25,759
doing I said some of these don't make

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,678
sense they're based on the old school

8
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:29,509
Nielsen's radio absolutely and that

9
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:30,858
doesn't really work anymore and I think

10
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:32,780
you and I have discussed previously like

11
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:35,149
Nielsen rating is literally like you get

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,370
a phone call hey Roger right did you

13
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:39,020
watch that Seinfeld last night how long

14
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:41,780
did you watch it for yeah frequently to

15
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,520
watch it for and that's it just doesn't

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,649
exist now in a world we're like digital

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,750
media and digital everything is the way

18
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:49,370
people market how do you enforce that

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,500
right well that's actually a really

20
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:54,828
interesting way to get on what you guys

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,299
are doing right so traffic routes well

22
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:57,948
why don't you get the good people at

23
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:59,058
home a little information about about

24
00:00:57,948 --> 00:01:01,308
what you guys are doing at traffic

25
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:03,828
routes yeah so traffic routes we are a

26
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:07,310
digital ad network so as you may or may

27
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:09,530
not know advertising in cannabis is a

28
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,799
challenge yeah simply because it's still

29
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,170
federally legal 1/2 and there's a lot of

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,460
unknowns so the traditional outlets such

31
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:22,009
as Facebook Google Instagram technically

32
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:23,509
you can't do it they're their guidelines

33
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:24,769
and regulations are very specific to

34
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:26,659
Facebook they just change some of that

35
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:28,280
though right they changed their search

36
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,750
criteria right but not their advertisers

37
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,359
right here so there is a misconception

38
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,188
there and I can touch on that as well

39
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,920
but simply because it's federally legal

40
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:39,078
now Facebook won't touch it obviously

41
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,939
Google won't touch it either right and

42
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:43,399
the one question I'll just answer it now

43
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:44,959
that I get the most is like well what

44
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:46,759
happens when it does go legal what

45
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,298
happens if it goes federally you know

46
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,159
right

47
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,320
so there are well double-click all of a

48
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:55,100
sudden me and the answer nothing's gonna

49
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:56,809
change simply because those guys are too

50
00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:00,109
interconnected with some of these bigger

51
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,539
ad networks like double-click like

52
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:05,060
Google yeah and they're not gonna risk

53
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,799
losing one of the bigger accounts like

54
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,289
Ford or Chevy or tired or whatever

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,030
because they show a cannabis ad next to

56
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:13,250
something like that right but more

57
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,759
importantly to take out of this is

58
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,979
cannabis isn't the only sector that

59
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:21,979
Google and Facebook won't touch there's

60
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:25,280
actually other areas that are federally

61
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:29,869
legal that Google and Facebook will not

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:34,520
touch like tobacco alcohol Firearms

63
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:36,200
Pharma nutriceuticals adult crypto so

64
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,840
kind of those polarizing topics where

65
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,979
yes you don't want to be seen - you

66
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,450
don't wanna be associated want to be

67
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:43,819
associated so in every single one of

68
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:47,269
those as a single siloed industry is

69
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:49,430
much bigger economy wise in cannabis

70
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,219
right so for those people that think

71
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,230
that once cannabis goes federally legal

72
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:56,270
that Facebook and Google gonna open up

73
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:57,859
their arms right I'm not sure if that's

74
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,360
gonna be that easy well so what makes

75
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,390
traffic routes different in that you're

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,790
able to publish advertisement on non

77
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:06,229
cannabis sites valid question yeah so

78
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:08,209
what we do is we work directly with the

79
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:09,769
sites and believe it or not at the site

80
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,180
level they're very open to it

81
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,980
we've been able to connect with some of

82
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,409
the you know pretty significant big

83
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:17,689
sites that are pushing a ridiculous

84
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:21,379
amount of users about 150 some of them

85
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:24,409
150 million unique users a month okay

86
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,939
and they're very open to it they're open

87
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:28,849
to the CBD they're open to a lot of

88
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:33,079
these cannabis products because it is

89
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:36,079
the the the new thing right and it's to

90
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,030
an extent it's there if they're open to

91
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,130
other things they're open to cannabis

92
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,409
right so how about from so it's from an

93
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:44,569
advertising perspective how about from a

94
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:46,370
Content perspective right like so are

95
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:49,669
these are these bigger sites opening up

96
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,009
to cannabis content yes okay yes so the

97
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:54,018
other question I get asked a lot is well

98
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:57,019
you know what about the age wall if I'm

99
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:59,239
advertising on a on a CNN or I'm

100
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:00,620
advertising on a Newsweek or I would you

101
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,090
know do they have to have an age wall

102
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,640
and I think that's another misconception

103
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,579
that people have the age wall isn't

104
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,078
really on the content sites the CNN

105
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,450
writes about right and of us all the

106
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,519
time yep Newsweek as well and some of

107
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:14,899
these other bigger publications also but

108
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,819
there is no age wall because it is

109
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,459
content the age wall comes into effect

110
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:22,219
once you click on that ad right and you

111
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,288
go to the product page right that's

112
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,180
where the age wall needs to live and

113
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:27,139
that's what needs to be in for

114
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,019
because that's where you're really

115
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,250
entering the product phase right not at

116
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,109
the content line you know it's no

117
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,160
different than alcohol tobacco right

118
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,710
these sort of things same thing I

119
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,270
remember years ago I worked for Sky

120
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:41,449
vodka and Campari and putting up those

121
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:42,560
age walls and those guys definitely even

122
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,939
though there are limitations on where

123
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,639
they can advertise you do see

124
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,800
advertisements for for liquor companies

125
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,939
for alcohol companies and then once you

126
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,340
get to the site that's where you had to

127
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,079
make sure you're collecting the the age

128
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:57,739
wall which I mean let's be honest right

129
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,779
like January 1st 1969 or something like

130
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,460
that right everyone puts in if it's the

131
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:03,949
bogus it's like it's just this

132
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:05,509
requirement that you have to have and no

133
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,759
one pays any attention it's like yeah

134
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:09,409
sure I'm over 21 but that's a liability

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,060
situation right that's what it is

136
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,250
content site does not have to have age

137
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,350
wall but a product side once you click

138
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,180
from the site to the product is where

139
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:20,150
the content page and the age one needs

140
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,230
to live we touch on the topic that you

141
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:24,829
and I know talked about quite a bit

142
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,939
which is education right it is and it's

143
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:28,189
not so much that there are so many

144
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:29,420
things you can and can't do I think it's

145
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:32,569
really more the problem really more so

146
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,250
as people aren't educated and have

147
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:35,810
clearly defined guidelines I'm sure

148
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,910
because every time I have a conversation

149
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,050
with somebody you know like you you and

150
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,950
I spent a lot of time together we talk

151
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,050
about this I think we're both pretty

152
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:44,180
well-informed about what the issues are

153
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,710
and aren't but I have so many

154
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,900
conversations with other people were

155
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:51,259
like well you can't do this and you're

156
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:53,449
like well actually I can you just have

157
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,399
to be very careful about it right and I

158
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:56,959
mean what's what's the solution there

159
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,939
like how do we you know I know we spend

160
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,859
a lot of time educating our clients you

161
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:03,290
know for us we we were one of the first

162
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,790
companies to focus on being TCPA

163
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,080
compliant so that we make sure that

164
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,760
anyone who's receiving our messaging has

165
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,109
opted into it and all that and make sure

166
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,909
they can opt out of it whenever they

167
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,770
want I know a lot of other companies who

168
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,510
came before us weren't so focused and

169
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:16,370
that's you know kind of the nature of

170
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,689
this industry and that so many people

171
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,310
would rather ask your forgiveness and

172
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:20,930
permission true right and now it's

173
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,839
catching up with a lot of folks it is

174
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,689
right it does come to education and I

175
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,539
think I think you're at the panel you

176
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:32,029
know last week when we talked on

177
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,039
education and what gluten-free was right

178
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:36,379
and I gave that example yep and I think

179
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:37,459
that's a pretty I think that falls in

180
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,459
line with kind of what we're talking

181
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:40,379
about

182
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,239
if we take that as an example again and

183
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,579
we say well who's following a

184
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,259
gluten-free diet now and who was

185
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:50,069
following a gluten-free diet

186
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,659
5 years ago 10 years ago 5 10 years ago

187
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:53,939
nobody knew what the hell was gluten

188
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,100
free yeah but because of education and

189
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,199
the marketing behind the education now

190
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,200
it's becoming a standard of like oh I'm

191
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,449
gluten free or I am this and I think

192
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,819
that's that's kind of where we are now

193
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:08,069
we have to set a standard only within

194
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,139
the marketing guidelines but really

195
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:12,240
explain to people how that affects their

196
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,949
brand and how can they affect their

197
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,410
their overall performance as a brand

198
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,699
right in such a gray industry especially

199
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,960
in the digital side yeah

200
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,889
on the digital side it's even more

201
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:25,139
complex simply because obviously we both

202
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,490
have internet at home yeah I don't know

203
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,039
if the Internet's registered under your

204
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,910
you know your fiancee your daughter your

205
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,730
aunt your mom I don't know yep and who

206
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,200
that internet it's registered to under

207
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:39,780
means nothing to who's behind that

208
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,670
screen agreed yeah and when you register

209
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,199
for your internet provider they don't

210
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,490
ask you for age they don't ask you how

211
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,349
many people on your household they don't

212
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,050
ask you who's gonna be using it there's

213
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,730
social name and address that's it so

214
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,620
from an advertising perspective it's

215
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,720
really hard to be able to track age

216
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,519
demographic on who behind who's behind

217
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,650
that screen right you can do data

218
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,569
overlays it gives you similar audiences

219
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:02,639
but a one-to-one relation on who that is

220
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:06,180
it's nearly impossible yeah now unless

221
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,699
something changes you touched on on you

222
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,900
know branding and marketing and unite we

223
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,310
spend a lot of time talking about this

224
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:12,719
and I think it's really really

225
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:18,060
interesting what's happening right now

226
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,770
and the emerging the emerging market

227
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,470
right so the newly acquired customers

228
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:23,909
right I mean you spend a lot of time

229
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,710
talking to advertisers and publishers I

230
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,620
know you know we do the same and for us

231
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:30,060
I think number one a demographic that

232
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,038
we're looking at right now is maybe the

233
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,269
Chardonnay mom you know we spend a lot

234
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:35,098
of time talking about the senior

235
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,199
community right and like these are

236
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,990
segments that need very different kinds

237
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,430
of of advertising of marketing they're

238
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,080
not comfortable you know they don't

239
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,569
understand strains they don't understand

240
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,129
straight names we talked about effect

241
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,030
based marketing like how is all this

242
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,539
impacting the work that you're doing

243
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,339
right now

244
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,599
how doesn't I think that creative we

245
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,269
talked in a creative life the last

246
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,570
penalty right yeah so we've taken a very

247
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:59,429
different approach and the way we the

248
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,290
way I see our ad network is kind of like

249
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:04,469
an investment portfolio we have to have

250
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:06,990
a very diverse portfolio of sites

251
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,670
whether it's cannabis sites mainstream

252
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:12,000
sites in mainstream I mean like

253
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:15,329
soccer-mom sites culture sites for men

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,200
sports sites tennis golf extreme sports

255
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:21,629
as well snowboarding skateboarding video

256
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,129
gaming believe it or not one of the most

257
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,600
interesting group of sites that we

258
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,970
started working with that reached out to

259
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,800
us was this group of publishers that

260
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,090
have about 50 sites I was like okay

261
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:36,479
let's talk you know see what you guys

262
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:39,840
have and they own crochet sites knitting

263
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,500
sites cooking sites nice scrapbooking

264
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,720
sites

265
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,250
Chardonnay mom Sharda mom Chardonnay

266
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,920
moms that's what you want everyone in

267
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,299
those in those sites are doing very well

268
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,610
not surprised

269
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:53,099
very well because that's like the mom

270
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,019
that it's kind of in the closet yeah

271
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,060
they want to kick that bottle of wine

272
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:00,179
yeah that went from one glass to two

273
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:01,589
glasses to a 750 milliliter bottle and

274
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,179
they're like well I'm gonna drink a

275
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,190
bottle now but it's not gonna be 750

276
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,769
it's gonna be 1.7 right let's do a

277
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,000
bottle a night absolutely and then

278
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:10,649
they're they're kind of dragging the

279
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,950
next day so I think that the modern

280
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:16,409
consumer is not the the stigma that they

281
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,240
were involved in seen in the past yeah

282
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:19,529
it's different I think a lot of the you

283
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,480
know a lot of people want to believe

284
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,579
that you need to market to this donor

285
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,050
culture in this space and quite frankly

286
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,110
let me don't get me wrong there is a

287
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:30,059
strong stoner component and then what

288
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,860
we've seen out there what is an ever

289
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,629
dwindling segment of the market right

290
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,460
it's a growing that's all it is it's in

291
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:36,659
addition to right which is why you know

292
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,340
we talked we touched a little bit on

293
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:39,509
effect based marketing right which i

294
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,639
think is really really interesting it's

295
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:43,980
a trend that's happening right now

296
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,629
you know the Chardonnay mom doesn't care

297
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,340
what strain she doesn't care of his

298
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:49,289
banana cut she doesn't care if it's og

299
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,100
cush she wants to know is this gonna

300
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:52,139
make me relax

301
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,690
yes is this gonna make me sleep is this

302
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:58,259
gonna make me focus what is this gonna

303
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,550
do for me and I feel like you know again

304
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,970
going back to the fact that you work

305
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:03,250
with non cannabis

306
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,990
I feel like from that angle that really

307
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,190
opens up a lot more opportunity it does

308
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,649
right because you're not talking about

309
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,270
this you know you're not talking to an

310
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:12,399
echo full of you know a room full of

311
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:15,579
echoes yeah they're talking to a new

312
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,620
audience you're dressing and it's even

313
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,720
today I think the stigma of cannabis

314
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,279
consumers are still there I mean if you

315
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,860
and I both walked out of our houses

316
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,449
tomorrow morning and we talked and we

317
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,980
knocked it you know three nor three

318
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,750
three doors to the right and three doors

319
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,220
to the left every single what I was

320
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,200
going to deny it the third cab is

321
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,399
consumers yeah but behind closed doors

322
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,259
it might be a different story

323
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,000
oh great and in that different story is

324
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:37,870
simply because of that stigma but

325
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,970
they're afraid they're gonna be

326
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,509
categorized that and and I think through

327
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:47,590
education through more normalization of

328
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:48,460
products that stigma is slowly being

329
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,320
ground

330
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,450
absolutely now you see this now I mean

331
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,490
you walk into just as an example am

332
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,070
Edmund right and they very carefully

333
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,500
curate their brands that they have on on

334
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,629
display you're not seeing you know I we

335
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,250
refer to it the bongs and thongs era of

336
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:04,629
cannabis right you're not seeing

337
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,909
everything in green and pot leaves on

338
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:07,809
everything and bright Rasta this and you

339
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:10,839
know that's that's all out the window

340
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:12,879
and now you know you have brands again

341
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,230
you know not to pick any one out for any

342
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,230
reason but like select for example comes

343
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,850
to mind Kiva comes to mind right these

344
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,310
are brands dosis comes to mind right

345
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,050
right these are brands that you look at

346
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:25,659
you go that's intriguing that's that's

347
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:27,699
not an intimidating package it doesn't

348
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:29,319
say anything about a specific strain it

349
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,120
says very clearly on the front it says

350
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,860
column you know they can destin does

351
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,070
this as well just calm says connect it

352
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,450
says sleep and you know as someone who I

353
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,980
mean I've been consuming since I was

354
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,200
eighteen there's twenty some years now

355
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,690
so for me none of that stuff matters but

356
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,610
if I'm talking to my mom you know they

357
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,320
have nowhere to run like they don't know

358
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,930
they have no idea I have no idea right

359
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,580
and so I think and for in that situation

360
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:52,689
my mom would be like I need you to come

361
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,250
to the store with me like if I'm gonna

362
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,930
do this I need you to come to serve with

363
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,940
me and point stuff out and be I get

364
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:59,139
people asked this to me all the time but

365
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,140
do you think your mom would go to the

366
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:04,269
store and order go for flour now from

367
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:06,069
the top no god I go vape go babe

368
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:07,840
edible actually sure I go edible right

369
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,700
which with so many people make a mistake

370
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,200
of doing that is their first product in

371
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,730
that they try because they think it's

372
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,250
safe it's a form factor they're familiar

373
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,680
with

374
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,778
yeah you're really oh man you're you're

375
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,458
walking a fine line there you overdue an

376
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:21,740
edible and you're you're never coming

377
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:23,359
back right which I mean is that an

378
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,669
opportunity is that an opportunity for

379
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,068
education that tell people I know this

380
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:29,719
seems like the way to go because it's

381
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:31,610
something that is familiar and it's a

382
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,009
brownie or it's a candy true but in

383
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,930
reality if you overdo it you know you're

384
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:38,389
gonna have a bad expedite you know what

385
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:40,599
Iran actually at the CBD Expo not too

386
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:44,329
long ago I ran to a gentleman that has

387
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,639
CBD wine and teach the infused wine very

388
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:48,049
nice I was like okay there you go you

389
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,839
know it's funny you said that

390
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:52,938
who was it Sarah McLachlan she did she

391
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,339
has a line I believe and it's one of the

392
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:57,948
few that I've seen that is both alcohol

393
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:59,300
and THC because so many the ones that

394
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:00,979
I've seen are Jets I thought it was

395
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:02,628
illegal to do THC and I'll call together

396
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,800
and I don't I don't know if this was

397
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:05,810
something that happened before all the

398
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:07,188
do regulations went into place but ya

399
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:09,109
know what from what I seen for the most

400
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:12,679
part it's a non-alcoholic beverages that

401
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:14,899
have THC or CBD added and you know

402
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:17,568
beverages we were at yeah we were at new

403
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,818
s last week right it was a I think BDS

404
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:21,110
scale talked about trends in the

405
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,088
marketplace in the beverage segment is

406
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,480
actually it's growing like crazy right

407
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,100
now

408
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,800
and that's I personally I love an

409
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,540
infused beverage I had I feel like I'm

410
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:32,479
dropping plugs but I honestly I'm not

411
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:33,019
getting paid for any of this but is it

412
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,139
sprig

413
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:37,818
I think sprig right yeah it's great CBD

414
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:39,769
infused sparkling waters I mean it's I

415
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:43,909
think they're doing great stuff there I

416
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:44,448
know and in Colorado Keith's Cola but

417
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:46,818
again

418
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:48,399
those guys are around longer and there

419
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:51,500
you go like Keith Cola I think it's very

420
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,929
almost stoner right I mean you know what

421
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,220
Keef is I know what Keef is but the

422
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:57,318
Chardonnay mom doesn't know what Keef is

423
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,778
right and so I think that a lot of that

424
00:14:57,318 --> 00:15:01,099
is changing now yeah I'd be really

425
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:02,600
interested to see especially with what

426
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,980
you guys are doing I'm assuming you've

427
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,439
got analytics around everything that

428
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,490
you've done we have so much data yeah I

429
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:10,698
think yes probably while we get along

430
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,789
yeah exactly as we need nerd out about

431
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:15,378
that all day long you have any sort of

432
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,308
trends that you're seeing a you want to

433
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:18,289
talk about anything

434
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:20,719
I think CBD right now is doing really

435
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:22,639
well there's hands down especially

436
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,769
online because it's a product that you

437
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,299
can advertise you can sell they can

438
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:26,570
monetize you can see a return immediate

439
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,179
right

440
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,730
it I'm here I'm curious I'll stop you

441
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:34,459
there for a second Horace again just to

442
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,330
maybe have a polarizing conversation

443
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,850
about this

444
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,770
we spent Rico and I we spent a lot of

445
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,269
time talking about who's an opportunist

446
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,799
in a space right now right like who's a

447
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:44,689
good actor who's an opportunist who's

448
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,859
just trying to make a quick buck of all

449
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,940
the CBD companies that you're seeing

450
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,560
what percentage do you think are

451
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,420
actually selling what they say they're

452
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,689
selling or how much of it is a placebo

453
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:54,979
effect it's hard to say yeah it's hard

454
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,180
to say because there's so many of those

455
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,220
that are being white-label

456
00:15:56,179 --> 00:16:02,000
yeah that's hard to see and track like

457
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,529
who is the who's at the top yeah who's

458
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,179
at the table and whose product is it

459
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,970
really it's just been relabeled right

460
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:10,189
absolutely doing a little bit of

461
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,509
research actually smart thing to do yeah

462
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,920
well don't get me wrong I think there's

463
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:15,679
a lot of CVD companies that are doing

464
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:17,149
the right thing more than there's more

465
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,519
good actors and bad actors let's say

466
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:22,610
that yeah but just in general I think

467
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,039
education once again you have to get you

468
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,690
have to do it yeah do it and it's not a

469
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,039
kid it can be overwhelming because

470
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,130
there's so many damn products out there

471
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:32,719
absolutely but it's nothing that can't

472
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:35,330
be done right it's just a matter of time

473
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,519
it's testing just like anything yeah

474
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,960
getting some samples trying the products

475
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,699
yeah that work for you and every person

476
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,190
is different yeah I know I mean for me

477
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,330
I'm one of those people that I can

478
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,550
consume all the CBT in the world and I

479
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,960
barely feel any affect off of it my

480
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:50,449
fiancee any other hand she loves it

481
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,879
she has a bit of anxiety little CVD goes

482
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:55,580
a long way for her helps her take the

483
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,379
edge off so I think I think it's a great

484
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,030
you know not to use a overplayed term

485
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:00,950
it's a great gateway drug you know to

486
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:03,559
get people involved in the cannabis

487
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:09,140
world because I've seen so many people

488
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:11,149
who even have some difficulty they have

489
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,240
to give them a little bit of pause to

490
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:17,209
even try the CBD through and and it's

491
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,088
really it's difficult to overstate how

492
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:23,150
non psychoactive it is right now like

493
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:25,069
you truly don't get any nothing nothing

494
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,509
I mean it's

495
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,429
but people still very hesitant but it

496
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:32,309
works it does yeah work yeah absolutely

497
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:35,490
so my dad has had all kinds of surgeries

498
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:39,619
knees shoulders like literally open back

499
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:44,460
surgery significant stuff not a drinker

500
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:45,839
obviously never consumed anything so one

501
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,150
of the trade shows I got some CBD

502
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,889
patches okay yeah the one to one and

503
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,650
then the TG that are one to one as well

504
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,360
and I gave a CBD you want it's it I'm

505
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,210
gonna get you ha just give it a try for

506
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,769
your back I give to him in a Thursday by

507
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,809
Saturday morning who's asking me for

508
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:02,819
more really it's like I don't know what

509
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:04,950
it is but it works I love that yeah and

510
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:06,119
it's like I'm like here try to teach g1

511
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,100
he's like this one even works better

512
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:12,359
right and it's a topical situation where

513
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:12,869
that's that's a good way to get you

514
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,519
anyway

515
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:16,500
as long as you're not ingesting it I

516
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,660
feel like people are more open to it

517
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,000
open it Ryan it's what they think it's

518
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,190
that perception if I smoke right I'm

519
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,529
gonna get a high even if it's CBD yeah

520
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,390
if I take something it's gonna go

521
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:30,269
systemic and it's gonna affect me yeah

522
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:33,000
but if it's topical it's topical right

523
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:34,619
exactly what's funny is how many people

524
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,809
how many of those people who are

525
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:37,979
hesitating but we're willing to go try a

526
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:39,329
topical solution do you think they've

527
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,009
ever looked at the ingredient list on

528
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:43,109
any other topical they've ever put on

529
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:44,309
themselves oh never know don't know the

530
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:46,589
first thing that goes into one of those

531
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:48,750
topics and there's probably worse oh my

532
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:50,459
god worse ingredients in there than CBD

533
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,809
so we were talking about trends so yours

534
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,340
we talked about CVD that's a big one

535
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,240
everyone's talking about it right again

536
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:56,699
I think it's because it's the one that's

537
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,259
safer yeah it's it's like you said it's

538
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,690
a very easy entry point

539
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:03,779
yeah industry and it's it's a non

540
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,309
aggressive non like you don't need to

541
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:06,839
know too much of the different strains

542
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:08,849
or different products or different types

543
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,769
to be able to understand it it's it's a

544
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:13,289
very simple product to understand when

545
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:16,680
it's a pill or just a swab or a teacher

546
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:18,480
whatever it is it's a lot easier one of

547
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,630
the trend side the CVS are doing really

548
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,170
well beverages as we talked about I'm

549
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:28,250
seeing more and more but sticking with

550
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:31,808
the trends I think it comes down to

551
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:34,909
the brands that are doing well are not

552
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:37,278
packaging it as yet as high as you can

553
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:40,070
get on it and that's that's important to

554
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:42,679
understand because that in itself will

555
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:45,519
attract that soccer-mom yeah that

556
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:48,320
professional woman that professional man

557
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,778
and that's that's the audience that has

558
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,038
the money absolutely to spend it yeah

559
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:53,269
and I remember this when we first

560
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:55,609
started Baker about four and a half

561
00:19:53,269 --> 00:20:00,980
years ago I remember being in Colorado

562
00:19:55,609 --> 00:20:02,058
and I had one of our guys come home with

563
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,679
his roommate who had just come home from

564
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:05,869
a cannabis store and he was excited

565
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,629
because he had this headband oh gee

566
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:10,548
and he's like 35% THC is like whoa count

567
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:14,658
me out like I I want no part of that

568
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:16,128
right and back then it really was a you

569
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:17,600
know and I've since dubbed this in

570
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:19,730
conversations I've had this prohibition

571
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,138
mentality right you want the biggest

572
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:23,569
bang for your buck if I'm gonna go out

573
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:26,329
and spend 50 bucks on an eighth it

574
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:29,028
better be strong yeah but that's that's

575
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:30,678
only in cannabis yeah it is because it

576
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:32,359
doesn't I don't think it applies to like

577
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,220
tobacco or alcohol but but think about

578
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,258
alcohol during alcohol prohibition you

579
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,548
weren't going out and buying beers right

580
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:39,259
you're going out you were buying whiskey

581
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:40,668
you're like gin you were getting your

582
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,220
biggest bang for but there wasn't there

583
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:44,570
wasn't that impro Bishan yeah inhibition

584
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,460
yes which were just kind of coming out

585
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:48,019
of right that's true serious and then

586
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,788
what we've seen is we've seen a

587
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:51,950
migration of all of a sudden you know

588
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:53,329
for me if I see something that's 15

589
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,069
percent THC I'm like that's real nice

590
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:56,628
I'm gonna be able to actually consume

591
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:58,849
this for a little bit right socially

592
00:20:56,628 --> 00:21:01,788
with other people function and move on

593
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:03,319
with my with my day and I and well I

594
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:06,528
mean that brings us back to branding

595
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:08,359
where we started and I think that that's

596
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:11,388
a topic that I love talking about right

597
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:14,658
now as the industry is progressing

598
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:16,849
I think product differentiation is so so

599
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:18,649
difficult right cuz it used to be right

600
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:20,898
well I mean the old school was lows mids

601
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:22,459
highs right and I that's that's I think

602
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:24,288
on the way the dodo you still have shops

603
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:28,308
that sell that way but for the most part

604
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:30,710
you know again you don't find really you

605
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:32,148
don't find brick wheat anymore right

606
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,700
you're not no one's selling brick weed

607
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:37,219
anymore a weed from the 70s when it had

608
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,259
seeds in it right exactly that's gone so

609
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,890
product differentiation based purely on

610
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:44,190
quality is very very difficult

611
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:46,500
so what's taking its place is brand

612
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,179
differentiation right identifying are

613
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,500
you selling to the Chardonnay mom are

614
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,780
you selling to the senior citizen

615
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,519
community are you selling to athletes

616
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:55,460
are you know Marvin Washington we spent

617
00:21:53,519 --> 00:22:01,019
a lot of time with him he's selling ice

618
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:02,340
ice ice it out hostile sport export and

619
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,730
those guys are very focused on the

620
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:07,709
athletes community I mean I saw we we

621
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,990
were Deven recently with five former NBA

622
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,440
players where they're pitching the value

623
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:16,589
of CBD al Harrington just launched viola

624
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,419
extracts and I mean all this time you're

625
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:20,428
wrong I think they're all great products

626
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,780
but if you were to remove all the

627
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:24,630
branding from all those products and put

628
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:27,210
them side by side it'd be very difficult

629
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,070
to figure out to know which ones which

630
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:32,340
because the products are all high

631
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:35,308
quality and and and so similar so brand

632
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,959
differentiation is really in my mind

633
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:38,099
where things are going forward you know

634
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,169
we're starting to see more marketing

635
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:41,548
professionals enter this space we're

636
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:43,470
starting to see fewer people trying to

637
00:22:41,548 --> 00:22:46,289
go for mass market appeal more people go

638
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,548
for that very focused second touch of

639
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:49,200
the market and I'm sure you're seeing a

640
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:51,869
lot of that as well and yeah you're

641
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,048
right on the niche marketing it's it's

642
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:56,668
true and don't get me wrong I love my

643
00:22:55,048 --> 00:22:58,400
cannabis sites that they're working with

644
00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:01,049
us and I appreciate what they're doing

645
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,179
put a lot of these brands like we talked

646
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:05,129
earlier don't want to advertise on

647
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:07,140
cannabis sites because they do want to

648
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:10,530
go after that very particular niche

649
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,210
audience that is not a cannabis consumer

650
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:13,918
currently right oh yeah everyone wants

651
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,750
that newly-acquired consumers and then

652
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,580
to retain them a retainer be like I want

653
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,140
you to be loyal to my brand I hooked you

654
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:20,819
on to my brand and now I'm gonna do

655
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,140
everything I can do to make sure you

656
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:23,668
don't leave my brand and that's all

657
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,480
marketing yeah that's all branding

658
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:28,380
that's all packaging that's all image

659
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,329
and I think there's room for everybody

660
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,950
whether it's the supports whether it's a

661
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:32,759
soccer mom whether it's a professional

662
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,830
businessman

663
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,750
it doesn't matter there is a product to

664
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:38,819
be able to tailor to each individual and

665
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,390
I think that market segment is growing

666
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:44,819
significantly from different aspects

667
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,950
just recently had a consulting call with

668
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:49,019
like this vaporizer company that was

669
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,600
working with us and they solely wanted

670
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:53,490
to advertise on cannabis sites

671
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,339
and the vaporizers like I don't know

672
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,870
$250 all right beautiful thing that

673
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:59,609
looks great comes the beautiful

674
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:02,549
definitely high-end market high-end

675
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:03,809
market and he's like it's not working

676
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:05,129
it's not working I'm like okay well

677
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,480
let's let's jump on a call let's figure

678
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:10,200
out what's going on and be more happy to

679
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,630
help you and I said well why are you

680
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,250
only targeting cannabis sites and he's

681
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,040
like well that's our that's our consumer

682
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:20,069
right I'm like no it's not I said that

683
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:22,289
was your consumer rights now you need to

684
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:23,879
be like oh there was broader yeah and

685
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:25,440
then start cutting the fat on the

686
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,120
marketing so once you start getting some

687
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,779
analytics back on what's actually

688
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,919
converting I said hey you know what

689
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:33,269
I'll give you I'll give some credit on

690
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,490
your account but we're gonna we're gonna

691
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:40,859
do this we're gonna target investment

692
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:43,769
sites smart and he's like why yep trust

693
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:47,009
me on this absolutely enough we went for

694
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:51,029
investment we went for mainstream like

695
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:53,400
news and media kind of hire and websites

696
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:58,559
we're more professional people at 10:00

697
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:00,750
right sure enough within ten days we

698
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,349
increased his ROI by about 200 percent

699
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,670
yeah not surprised I mean that brand

700
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:08,429
marketing focus focusing on a specific

701
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:11,490
segment is working so well for people

702
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:13,019
right now and so I mean I think you know

703
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:17,009
if there's anything I've been seeing as

704
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:18,299
far as from a career-wise trend what's

705
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:19,470
hot right now because I mean a lot of

706
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,389
people ask me how they can get involved

707
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,680
in the cannabis industry and the first

708
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,630
thing I tell them is you don't have to

709
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,070
cultivate you're not gonna you're not a

710
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,060
cultivator you don't know nearly as much

711
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:28,679
as these guys who've been doing it for

712
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,389
30 years you don't have to get a license

713
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,560
you don't have to be a dispensary just

714
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,210
like what do you do

715
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,859
true and do it in the cannabis space

716
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,990
exactly and so I think the biggest

717
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:38,639
influx right now that I'm seeing is

718
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,140
marketers I think marketers are

719
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,780
realizing that the time has finally come

720
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,640
to where the maturity in the cannabis

721
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:47,670
industry is where it has to be to where

722
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,910
you can go in and help people understand

723
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:52,320
why spending ten fifty a hundred

724
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,570
thousand dollars if you're med men

725
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,269
millions of dollars on marketing makes

726
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:58,889
sense makes sense because that's where

727
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:00,930
you're gonna get that newly acquired

728
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,550
customer and we are actually getting a

729
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:05,970
lot of the mainstream marketing

730
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:08,639
companies reach out to us connect with

731
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:11,250
us and say hey I know what you're doing

732
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,380
yep absolutely we got clients and these

733
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,210
guys and that's kind of in the same line

734
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,790
where some of these bigger cannabis

735
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:20,400
brands are going for the bigger

736
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:22,049
mainstream advertising agencies instead

737
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,820
of going with the cannabis agencies on

738
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:27,960
some reason so now the mainstream

739
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:31,349
agencies media buying and marketing

740
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,910
agencies are coming directly to us so

741
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:34,019
then those agencies that are mainstream

742
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,269
are like well we don't know where to buy

743
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:38,160
cannabis traffic or where we source it

744
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:39,900
right and eventually end up on our desk

745
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,000
and they're like oh yeah great let's

746
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,430
let's work together so you guys can be

747
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,660
our cannabis arm yep to the digital

748
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:50,370
advertising space which is great and the

749
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,630
question always comes up wow you know we

750
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:53,789
can't do through Google we can't do

751
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,520
through this but and in that sense

752
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:59,519
sometimes Google and us share the same

753
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:00,930
sites yeah I mean that's fine yeah

754
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,420
there's room for everybody think just

755
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,860
just being able to access non cannabis

756
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,750
sites to your platform is a huge value

757
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:10,529
add right and it's also something that's

758
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:12,630
really easy to demonstrate to people how

759
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:15,000
that is a value add it's like you can

760
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:17,010
advertise on BuzzFeed you can advertise

761
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,019
on this side on this side whatever it is

762
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:20,430
and people just again tell lack of

763
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:24,420
education they didn't know they could do

764
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:27,000
that a good example was a music site

765
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,410
that we started working with and I have

766
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,759
to jump on a call I got in the phone

767
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,340
with their operations

768
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,650
I got it all the way up to their CEO and

769
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,480

770
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,810

772
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:44,639

773
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,110

775
